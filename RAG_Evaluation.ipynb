      "Nvidia's stock is currently experiencing a significant increase in value, with a 15% jump in premarket trading after the company reported bumper earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. The U.S. tech giant posted revenue of $22.10 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, a rise of 265% year on year, while net income surged by 769%. The company's Data Center business, which includes its H100 graphics cards used for AI training, posted sales of $18.4 billion in the fourth quarter, representing 409% year-on-year growth. The positive outlook from Nvidia has prompted a round of broker upgrades, with JPMorgan raising its price target on the stock from $650 to $850 and Bank of America Global Research hiking its target from $800 to $925.\n"
