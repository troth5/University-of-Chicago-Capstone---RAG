Jayakumar, also the AIADMK organising secretary, scripted his own success in remaining as the MLA of Royapuram Assembly constituency for a quarter of a century, inflicting humiliating defeats on successive DMK and Congress candidates who challenged him. \"DJ Annan,\" (elder brother) as he is affectionately called by his supporters in his constituency, had lost only during the 1996 assembly election to DMK\\'s R Mathivanan, when a strong anti-incumbency swept away the then ruling AIADMK in the hustings. \\xa0 He registered his first impressive win in the 1991 election, trouncing Mathivanan and maintained his winning streak in elections in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. His different campaign styles continue to draw crowds and the ever smiling former Assembly Speaker does not hesitate to wear the white cap similar to that worn by party founder and late chief minister M G Ramachandran, or sing a popular number from \"Puratchi Thalaivar\\'s\" films, to connect with the people. Ramachandran is addressed as \\'Puratchi Thalaivar,\\' meaning revolutionary leader. \\xa0 Jayakumar even sprang a surprise recently by playing kabaddi with the youth on his way home after winding up the day\\'s hectic election campaign. His unparalleled popularity is something that cannot be underestimated, but rival DMK insists a change is required. \"It is time for change, the time for the Rising Sun (DMK symbol) under the leadership M K Stalin to emerge,\" has been the constant refrain of the party\\'s 54-year old candidate R Murthy\\'s election campaign. He is the proprietor of iDream Cinemas and iDream properties. \\xa0 But Jayakumar, contesting for the seventh time from his home turf, is confident of emerging victorious this time too. Despite its mixed bag of communities, traffic woes of residents of Royapuram assembly constituency have not ended. Fishermen, who play a major role in tilting the scales, are apprehensive of the multi-crore developmental programmes in the coastal villages as these threaten their livelihood opportunities. \"DMK\\'s assurance for a sea bridge project connecting Chennai Port-Thiruvottriyur to eliminate traffic congestion and fasten commercial access to and out of the port is not needed. This will only corrode the livelihood opportunities of the fisher folk,\" says Bharathi Ku, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association (SIFWA). \\xa0 \"What we need is livelihood protection initiatives, not multi-crore projects that eat into our villages,\" he argues. The fishermen are also opposed to establishing desalination plants in the coastal villages. \"The ever increasing population and floating population of at least 50,000 people on an average per day into Royapuram for trading and other activities makes this constituency prone to frequent traffic snarls,besides taxing existing resources,\" 60-year old Jayakumar, who hails from the fishing community, told P T I. \\xa0 Despite being a small area, the density of population is high and streets are narrow in Royapuram. Not less than 3,500 autos make sorties into Royapuram on any given day, Jayakumar, who is also an advocate, claims. \"So this calls for implementing a master plan to meet the increasing requirements of the people. Though the second phase of the Metro rail project will sharply dissuade the dependency on two-wheelers and other vehicles,I will appoint a consultant to transform this constituency into a model one, he said. Already due to his efforts, problems of water stagnation and power cuts have been resolved and slum clusters replaced with multi-storied apartments to accommodate the poor, he said, adding that improving the amenities in Mint is next in the agenda. \\xa0 Murthy, on the other hand, assures to upgrade the century-old RSRM Maternity Hospital on par with the AIIMS. \"Also, the constituency needs an arts college,\" he said. Apart from building a huge library,the DMK candidate said he will establish six community halls with parking facilities, a modern auditorium, a library for each division and a multi-level parking facility in the constituency, if he wins. \"We still face the problems of drinking water and inadequate drainage facility. In certain areas, sewage water mingles with drinking water. This needs to be set right immediately,\" Murthy told P T I. \\xa0 A total of 26 candidates, including S Kamali of Naam Tamilar Katchi and S Gunas/ekaran of Makkal Needhi Maiam, are in the fray for the April 6 election.

In recent weeks, suggestions that Trump may cancel the deal have emanated from the White House almost daily, and businesses, investors, and China trade watchers are hanging on to every word and tweet. But on Friday, when Trump said the United States would start dismantling trade and travel privileges for Hong Kong, he did not mention the deal. Stock markets heaved a sigh of relief, with the S&P 500 reversing losses.\\xa0 Talking tough on China and criticizing the Obama administration\\'s more measured approach is a key part of Trump\\'s re-election strategy. Sticking with the pact may mean accepting that China is likely to fall short of purchase commitments for US\\xa0agricultural goods, manufactured products, energy and services - goals that many said were unrealistic\\xa0even before the pandemic. Canceling the deal, though, would reignite the nearly two-year US-China trade war at a time US\\xa0unemployment is at its worst since the 1930s Great Depression. The next US\\xa0step would likely be reviving previously planned but canceled tariffs on some $165 billion worth of Chinese consumer goods, including Apple cellphones and computers, toys and clothing - all ultimately paid by US\\xa0companies and passed on to consumers. Beijing would retaliate with tariffs on US\\xa0goods, fueling more market turmoil and delaying recovery. \"He\\'s stuck with a lemon. He gets an empty agreement if he sticks with it, and he gets more actions that create an economic drag and more volatility if he abandons it,\" said one person briefed on the administration\\'s trade deliberations.

The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimates\\xa0that during the first quarter, China made only about 40% of the purchases it needed to stay on target for a first-year increase of $77 billion over 2017 levels, implying an extremely steep climb in the second half. Leaving the deal now would not buy a lasting political bounce for Trump in manufacturing-heavy swing states with five months to go before the presidential election, analysts say. Trump blames China for failing to contain the coronavirus and has repeatedly said the deal, including its pledges to boost US\\xa0exports to China by $200 billion over two years, no longer means as much to him with US\\xa0coronavirus deaths now over 100,000 and job losses piling up. Trump said on Friday that China was \"absolutely smothering Hong Kong’s freedom,\" but refrained from harsh sanctions that could put the trade deal in jeopardy, taking milder steps to revoke the territory\\'s separate travel and customs benefits from China.\\xa0 Claire Reade, a former US\\xa0trade negotiator, said Trump\\'s \"peripheral steps\" would not deter Beijing from proceeding with the security law, as it regards Hong Kong as a core national security issue.\\xa0 \\xa0 \"Probably the most significant thing from the trade perspective is that the Phase 1 trade deal is – for now anyway - unaffected,\" said Reade, senior counsel with Arnold and Porter law firm in Washington.\\xa0 White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow criticized Beijing last week, but on trade told CNBC: \"It’s a complex relationship.

As dozens of new blazes scorched the countryside and the country\\'s largest city was cloaked in hazardous smoke, conservative leader Scott Morrison defended his climate record, saying Australia was \"doing our bit\". His comments came after weeks spent refusing to speak about the link between climate change and deadly fires described by the emergency services as unprecedented in number and scale for the early bushfire season. As more people in the southeast of the country were told to evacuate their homes and schoolchildren in Sydney were again forced to play indoors, Morrison dismissed mounting calls for action. \"The suggestion that any way shape or form that Australia, accounting for 1.3 per cent of the world\\'s emissions... are impacting directly on specific fire events, whether it is here or anywhere else in the world, that doesn\\'t bear up to credible scientific evidence,\" he told ABC radio. Scientists, former fire chiefs and residents touched by bushfires have all drawn the link between this season\\'s more intense fires and climate change. Drought, unseasonably hot, dry and windy conditions have fuelled the unprecedented blazes. Scientists believe many of those factors are made worse by rising global temperatures. On Thursday bushfires burned across every region of Australia with residents in Victoria warned to leave high-risk areas and officials in New South Wales reporting more than 600 homes have been destroyed in recent weeks. Morrison is facing calls to cut greenhouse gas emissions and rapidly transition to renewable energy -- a sensitive debate in light of Australia\\'s lucrative mining industry. Australia has committed to globally agreed climate targets to help limit warming, but its emissions continue to rise and targets are only being met with the use of some creative carbon accounting,\\xa0using credits gained in past decades.

Victoria Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said firefighters were batting \"some of the worst conditions that you\\'d expect to see, often in February or March, and we\\'re seeing them in November\". \"It is incredibly dry, it will continue to get drier as the months go on over this summer, so the conditions we see today are likely conditions that we\\'ll confront over this summer,\" she said. The Bureau of Meteorology said \"large areas\" of central and eastern Victoria broke maximum temperature records for November,\\xa0including in Melbourne where the mercury reached 40.9 Celsius, while a dramatic dust storm swept through the town of Mildura, turning the sky a vivid orange. Country Fire Authority chief Steve Warrington earlier told people living in high-risk rural areas to leave for the safety of cities. \"We are saying, \\'do not be there, do not be there when a fire occurs, because you will not survive if you are there\\',\" he said.

The Biden administration through the US\\xa0Trade Representative\\'s Office (USTR) faced a Sunday (Apr 11) night deadline on whether to take the rare step of reversing a US\\xa0International Trade Commission decision unless the companies had agreed a deal. An announcement of the battery makers\\' settlement is expected soon, the sources said. The agreement is a win for President Joe Biden who has made boosting electric vehicles and US\\xa0battery production a top priority. The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs, and Biden has proposed spending US$174 billion to hike EV sales and expand charging infrastructure. The accord puts an end to a bitter two-year dispute between affiliates of two of South Korea\\'s biggest conglomerates. After losing out to SK in its bid to win Volkswagen orders, LG accused SK of stealing trade secrets by poaching nearly 80 of its employees. The ITC in February sided with LG Chem after the company accused SK of misappropriating trade secrets related to EV battery technology and issued a 10-year-import ban, but it allowed SK to import components for batteries for Ford\\'s EV F-150 program for four years, and Volkswagen\\'s North American EVs for two years. SK vowed to walk away from its US$2.6 billion Georgia battery plant under construction if the ITC decision was not overturned. The ITC also faulted what it called SK\\'s \"egregious misconduct\" and SK\\'s destruction of documents ordered by company executives. Ford, VW, LG and SK declined to comment. Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh wrote in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that if the ITC decision were left in place, it could \"reduce US\\xa0battery capacity and delay the transition to electric vehicles\". LG first filed a complaint against SK in 2019 and both sides hired numerous lawyers and consultants to make their case to the Biden administration. The administration has been pushing the two companies to try to reach a settlement, as have VW and Ford, the sources said. US\\xa0Trade Representative Katherine Tai has been personally involved in the settlement discussions and urged both companies to come to a resolution, sources said. USTR declined to comment. SK in March received proposed terms from LG, including financial reparations to address LG\\'s trade secrets misappropriation claims, Reuters reported earlier citing a person familiar with the situation. Georgia is home to two newly-elected Democratic US\\xa0Senators who are a linchpin of Biden\\'s slim Congressional majority and have both spoken about the importance of ensuring the Georgia plant\\'s future. Both senators repeatedly pressed the companies to reach agreement. Warnock praised the reported deal that will ensure the Georgia plant\\'s survival, saying in a statement on Saturday that it \"will help keep the local economy moving forward\". Last month, Georgia\\'s Republican Governor Brian Kemp urged Biden to intervene, noting SK\\'s plant will employ nearly 2,600 and is the largest foreign investment in the state\\'s history: \"Simply put: the livelihoods of thousands of Georgians are now in your hands.\" LG\\'s battery unit LG Energy Solution is nearing completion of an Ohio cell manufacturing plant with General Motors and is close to announcing plans to build a US$2.3 billion second facility in Tennessee, sources told Reuters.

The episode came a day after the Islamic republic said it had started up advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges at the site, in a breach of its commitments under a troubled 2015 deal with world powers. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Iran Atomic Energy Organisation (IAEO), condemned a \"futile\" act, while urging the international community to \"confront this anti-nuclear terrorism\", in a statement carried by state television. The attack was carried out by \"opponents of the country\\'s industrial and political progress, who aim to prevent development of a thriving nuclear industry,\" he said, without specifying what country or entity might be behind the alleged sabotage. IAEO spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi had earlier reported an accident at the enrichment facility caused by a \"power failure\". No one was injured and there was no radioactive release, the official Fars news agency reported, citing the spokesman. Kamalvandi said there had been \"an accident in part of the electrical circuit of the enrichment facility\" at the Natanz complex near Tehran. \"The causes of the accident are under investigation and more details will be released later,\" he added, before the later statement put out by the agency\\'s chief. He did not say whether power was cut only in the enrichment facility or across other installations at the site. Malek Chariati, spokesman for the Iranian parliament\\'s energy commission, took to Twitter to allege sabotage. \"This incident, coming (the day after) National Nuclear Technology Day, as Iran endeavours to press the West into lifting sanctions, is strongly suspected to be sabotage or infiltration,\" Chariati said. Iran\\'s President Hassan Rouhani had on Saturday inaugurated a cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium and two test cascades at Natanz, in a ceremony broadcast by state television. An Israeli public broadcast journalist, Amichai Stein, said on Twitter \"the assessment is that the fault\" at Natanz is the \"result of an Israeli cyber operation\", without elaborating or providing evidence to corroborate his claim. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said later Sunday that \"the struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission\". \"The situation that exists today will not necessarily be the situation that will exist tomorrow,\" he added, without elaborating. Netanyahu made the remarks during an event involving intelligence service Mossad and the army for Israel\\'s independence anniversary. Iran\\'s president had on Saturday also inaugurated a replacement factory at Natanz, after an explosion at a facility making advanced centrifuges there last July. Iranian authorities likewise blamed the July incident on \"sabotage\" by \"terrorists\", but have not released the results of their investigation into it. The equipment inaugurated Saturday enables quicker enrichment of uranium and in higher quantities, to levels that violate Iran\\'s commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal it agreed with the five permanent United Nations Security Council powers, plus Germany. The administration of then-US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from this multilateral nuclear accord in 2018 and re-imposed biting sanctions on Iran. Iran later responded by progressively rolling back its own commitments under the agreement. Trump\\'s successor Joe Biden has said he is prepared to return to the deal, arguing it had - until Washington\\'s withdrawal - been successful in dramatically scaling back Iran\\'s nuclear activities. Iran\\'s latest move to step up uranium enrichment follows an opening round of talks in Vienna Tuesday with representatives of the remaining parties to the nuclear deal on bringing the US back into it. The talks are focused not only on lifting the crippling economic sanctions Trump reimposed, but also on bringing Iran back into compliance. Iran\\'s nemesis Israel has always been implacably opposed to the 2015 accord. In November last year, Iran\\'s top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed by machine gun fire while travelling on a highway outside Tehran. Iran\\'s elite Revolutionary Guards said a satellite-controlled gun with \"artificial intelligence\" was used in the attack, which Tehran blamed on Israel. Uranium enrichment can produce the fuel for a nuclear reactor, or in highly extended form, the fissile core of an atomic warhead. It is one of the most sensitive nuclear activities carried out by Iran. Rouhani had again underlined at Saturday\\'s ceremony that Tehran\\'s nuclear programme is solely for \"peaceful\" purposes.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a749d59d-9254-4983-a05b-4584ae04c3c3', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'World', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/suspected-islamists-free-1300-prisoners-from-east-congo-jail/', 'title': 'Suspected Islamists free 1,300 prisoners from east Congo jail', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Suspected Islamists free 1,300 prisoners from east Congo jail. Armed men freed more than 1,300 prisoners from a jail in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a coordinated attack on Tuesday, the town’s mayor said, blaming an Islamist militant group operating in the area. Militants stage 1,300-prisoner Congo jailbreak Only 110 of 1,456 inmates, including a number of militia fighters, remained following the simultaneous early morning assaults on the Kangbayi central prison in Beni and the military camp defending it, said Modeste Bakwanamaha. “The attackers, who came in large numbers, managed to break the door with electrical equipment,” Bakwanamaha told Reuters. “We believe it was the ADF who did this.” The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has killed more than 1,000 civilians since the start of 2019, according to U.N. figures, despite repeated military campaigns aimed at destroying it. Islamic State said fighters from its Central African Province franchise carried out the attack, according to its AMAQ news agency. The group has claimed responsibility for several suspected ADF attacks in the past. But U.N. experts have consistently found that claims ADF is linked to international jihadists are overblown or false, said Dan Fahey, a former U.N. investigator. Escapes are common from Congo’s overcrowded and poorly secured prisons. A similar number of inmates escaped when the same jail was attacked in June 2017. “This sounds more like an attack by Mai Mai (local rebels), who did the attack three years ago,” Fahey said. ‘MAY THE STATE HAVE MERCY’ Two inmates were shot dead during Tuesday’s raid, which started at around 4:30 a.m., police said on Twitter. The bolt on the prison’s front door appeared to be cut, as well as the metal grate behind it, Reuters TV footage in the aftermath of the raid showed. “We were sleeping in the morning, but around 4:00 we heard a really loud exchange of fire,” said Lukiya Bafana Ruban, one of the few inmates who decided not to flee. “May the state have mercy on us because we voluntarily stayed here in prison.” Kangbayi prison holds members of local rebel groups as well as ADF fighters. Bakwanamaha said there were rumours ADF fighters in the prison were preparing a break-out in the days preceding the attack. By midday around 20 prisoners had returned to the prison, he added. A year ago the army launched a large-scale counter-insurgency campaign against the ADF.

Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that experts have recorded in recent weeks \"very rare but very serious cases of thrombosis\" in people vaccinated with AstraZeneca. \"They are findings that (Germany\\'s vaccine commission) and finally us, cannot ignore,\" she said. Germany\\'s vaccine commission known as STIKO earlier Tuesday recommended that use of the jabs be halted for under-60s because of \"currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects\" in younger vaccinated people. \\xa0 It intends to make another recommendation by the end of April on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received a first dose of the vaccine, it said. Pending this decision, ministers said people who are due for their second jab can either choose to take it if cleared by their attending doctor, or they can opt to wait for the commission to make its recommendation. The latest restrictions amounted to a new setback for the vaccine developed by the Anglo-Swedish laboratory. Nevertheless Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany would be able to meet its goal of offering every adult a coronavirus jab by the end of the summer. \\xa0 Just after it received approval from European regulator EMA for use in the bloc, Germany restricted the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s because of insufficient data. After clearing it for older people subsequently, Germany along with several EU nations suspended its use again in mid-March because of clotting fears. Just over a week after allowing its use again, German authorities have now again halted its use among younger people. Merkel insisted however that it is such careful consideration and transparency that can keep the public\\'s confidence in the vaccine. \\xa0 \"Trust stems from the knowledge that every suspicion, every individual case will be examined,\" she said. The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people. Germany\\'s medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday. Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week. \\xa0 On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s \"pending further analysis\".

No motivation was immediately known. With Congress unable to agree on broad new gun regulations, like stricter background checks for gun buyers, Biden announced six executive measures which he said would help tamp down the crisis. Republicans immediately attacked the proposal, with the party\\'s senior leader in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, warning of \"unconstitutional overreach.\" In addition to relatively modest moves on the politically hyper-sensitive issue, Biden used his Rose Garden speech to announce the nomination of David Chipman, a gun-control proponent and former law enforcement officer, as head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Reflecting the lack of unity in Washington around anything to do with firearms restrictions, the ATF - a key agency in the fight against gun violence - has not had a Senate-confirmed director since 2015. Biden\\'s six measures included a proposed rule to \"stop proliferation of ghost guns,\" as firearms built from home kits are known. The White House says these homemade weapons are especially of concern because they have no serial numbers and cannot be traced after being used in crimes. Another proposed rule will be tightening regulations on arm braces designed to stabilize pistols, a device used by the man who killed 10 people in a Colorado grocery store last month. Under the rule, pistols with braces would be classified as short-barreled rifles, putting them under stricter control. Other measures include boosting support for agencies involved in tackling community violence and ordering the first comprehensive report on firearms trafficking in the United States since 2000. Nearly 40,000 Americans die each year from shootings. While mass shootings like recent killings in Colorado, Georgia and California attract most attention, more than half of the annual death toll is due to suicide. Biden said his proposals were just a start and urged Congress to take on far-reaching measures, like added background checks and ending the sale of powerful rifles often used in mass killings. \"I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one. But even here, there is much more common ground than anyone would believe,\" he said. \"The idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun violence in America is a blemish on our character as a nation.\" Despite Biden\\'s appeal, there is ferocious opposition to banning powerful weapons like the AR-15, a semi-automatic resembling the US military M16 rifle. It has become notorious as both the tool of choice in many mass shootings and a hugely popular item for sports shooters and legal gun enthusiasts. Biden successfully backed an assault weapons ban in 1994 when he was a senator. The law expired a decade later, however, and has never been renewed, with Republicans increasingly rigid in opposing what they depict as an attack on the more than two centuries-old constitutional right of citizens to have weapons. \"President Biden\\'s executive actions today do two things: appease the far left and infringe upon our Second Amendment right to bear arms,\" Representative Robert Aderholt of Alabama tweeted, echoing the skepticism of numerous Republicans. \"They want to take your guns,\" said another Republican lawmaker, Ohio\\'s Jim Jordan. McCarthy vowed his party would \"strongly oppose and pursue every option - be it legislative or judicial - to protect the right to keep and bear arms.\" In March, after the shooting spree in Colorado, Biden said he wanted Congress to pass \"common sense steps\" to restrict firearms.

That includes\\xa082 people killed in the town of Bago, near Yangon, on Friday, which the AAPP called a \"killing field\". \"The world watches in horror, as the army uses violence against its own people,\" he said. China and Russia both have ties to Myanmar\\'s armed forces, as the largest and second-largest suppliers of weapons to the country, respectively. The United Nations\\xa0Security Council last week called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and others detained by the military, but stopped short of condemning the coup. The EU is preparing fresh sanctions on individuals, as well as companies owned by the Myanmar military. The bloc in March agreed on a first set of sanctions on 11 individuals linked to the coup, including the commander-in-chief of the military. While EU economic leverage in the country is relatively small, Borrell said the EU could offer to increase its economic ties with Myanmar if democracy is restored. That could include more trade and investments in sustainable development, he said. EU foreign direct investment in Myanmar totalled US$700 million in 2019, compared with US$19 billion from China. The military says it staged the coup because an election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party last November\\xa0was rigged. The election commission has dismissed the assertion.

Though the lockdown had shuttered onsite operations for most learning organisations, it opened new avenues for the digital ones with 94 per cent saying they have considered learning a new skill during this period to leverage extra time at home that will solidify their resume to sail through the new normal, according to the IP-driven incubation lab, BridgeLabz, survey. The survey is based on online interviews of over 1,100 engineering graduates during August 10-14 across the country. BridgeLabz was set up to bridge the skill-gap among the existing talent pool of engineers by making them job-ready through experiential learning and focused mentorship. Digitisation has emerged as the fourth industrial revolution enabling continuous learning and remote working and is on the verge to redefine the role of upskilling in future-proofing aspirants against market downturns. A majority of students side with the online medium for its ability to provide quick answers and convenience of access when it comes to preferential mode of learning, the survey revealed. About 42 per cent of freshers find live sessions with mentors best for on-the-spot query resolution, while 21 per cent find offline classroom-based training to be a viable learning option. The survey revealed that the trend can be accredited to the experiential learning model and upskilling programmes that allow learners to seek live help from industry experts while they hone their skills leveraging online platforms. About 37 per cent prefer recorded classes for their ease of accessibility from anywhere, anytime while offline mode has least takers as only 21 per cent choose an offline classroom-based learning model, it added. The digital disruption is not only affecting the learning preferences but also the working landscape, the survey opined. A whopping 72 per cent of users want to work remotely as opposed to 28 per cent who wish to work from the office, it found.

Other countries have run-of-the-mill elections. India, and \\xa0has a “festival of democracy” Therefore it’s hardly surprising that in the middle of the second wave of , the prime minister wants the good citizens of India to have themselves a or a vaccination festival. In his speech, Narendra Modi suggested that a between 11 and 14 April could boost the vaccination drive. Also, 11 April happens to be the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotiba Phule while 14 April is that of Babasaheb Ambedkar. This could be some strategist’s brainwave of killing two birds with one jab. One year ago as India went into lockdown the prime minister had other festive ideas to raise our spirits - we clanged pots and pans, blew conch shells, lit divas. There were even WhatsApp forwards about how that vibration was going to destroy the virus. One year later the virus is rampaging through the country in its second wave, those WhatsApp forwarders have move on to other causes and we have upped the game from pots and pans and candles to a full-fledged festival. Cynics might roll their eyes but the\\xa0prime minister knows that as soon as it’s called a festival it becomes a red-letter day in our minds. Amazon and Flipkart can do “Tika Utsav” bumper sales starting on 12:01\\xa0am on 11 April until 11:59\\xa0pm on 14 April. Pizza Hut can deliver Tika Utsav special pizzas - with tika kebab toppings of course. Each city can have friendly contests to see which centre doles out the most shots in one day, that’s vaccine shots, not alcoholic ones. Anything that encourages vaccination is of course something to be encouraged. And the prime minister is in his own way a cheerleader-in-chief for the nation. Thus he is to be commended for trying to encourage all eligible Indians to go out and get vaccinated. And if some upbeat festival messaging works better than doom-and-gloom portents so be it. Of course, there is a danger that in the rush to celebrate tika utsavs, we could crowd vaccination centres and forget about social distancing but that’s a minor quibble. But what feels incongruous is this cheery PSA for a “festival of vaccination” occurs at the same time as a “festival of democracy” is unfolding in so many states across India. The pandemic and the election seem to be occurring in different worlds, hermetically sealed from each other. There are two Indias, one in which a second wave is raging and one in which elections are happening and apparently never the twain shall meet. Mind you this is a country where a court rules that you can be fined for not wearing your mask while alone in your car. A vehicle is a “public place” says the Delhi High Court but a political rally is obviously not. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan recently scolded his fellow citizens for letting down their guard and allowing the Covid numbers to explode afresh. He blamed “lack of commitment and sincerity” and said, “nobody is interested in wearing the mask.. there’s no respect for the norms of physical distancing.” , the same minister shared pictures of his party leaders holding election rallies where hardly anyone was wearing a mask and there was certainly no physical distancing happening. “One look at Harsh Vardhan’s Twitter feed makes it quite clear who could be called out “for taking everything casually’” writes Rohan Venkataramakrishnan in . It’s not a BJP problem. It’s a problem pretty much across the political spectrum. Old habits die hard. Old electioneering habits die especially hard. Photographs from rallies across Bengal for example, whether Trinamool or BJP or the Left Front-Congress combine, would hardly suggest the country is grappling with a pandemic. It looks just like something from five years ago. Perhaps the fact that the Bihar elections did not cause a huge explosion in infections lulled us into a false sense of complacency. But these elections are happening in the middle of a certified second wave. Yet the same politicians who wag their fingers at the public for giving safety precautions a “tilanjali” seem to have no interest in leading by example. And they do not even see the jarring dissonance. It is obviously not easy in a country like India to do physical distancing at the best of times, let alone at election time. But we can do our bit. The symbolism matters. Though Donald Trump sneered at Joe Biden for wearing a mask during his campaign, Biden resolutely stuck to it. The open-air inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with the guests wearing masks sent out two messages - one, that the business of democracy and transition of power must go one and two, they must go on with as much safety precautions as possible in these grave times. It was about fortitude in face of a pandemic not the denial of it. It will never be foolproof but the message is important. The visual of masked politicians on stage at an election rally in India would send out a message as well. A top political leader taking his mask off to address the rally and then putting it back on would send out a message. Similarly, a crowded stage filled with maskless jostling politicians sends out its own message to the rank and file. A political candidate in Kolkata told reporters asking him about lack of masks and safety norms that he was “not afraid” of the virus and he would win, Covid or no Covid. Tirath Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand tells devotees planning to attend Mahakumbh that “nobody will be stopped in the name of ” because “faith is stronger than fear”. Two days later he tested positive. At this point it’s baffling that politicians still think bravado is the vaccine we all need. Now the Haridwar district magistrate has said all schools in the district will remain closed from 9 to 15 April not because of fears but “in view of a huge rush of devotees to Kumbh Mela.” It’s clear that after a year everyone is suffering from Covid safety exhaustion. The masks are slipping and weddings and parties are back and public transport is crowded. We read about rising numbers and lack of beds but there’s no indication that it’s affecting our behaviour. A video of a cheerful woman at a temple during Holi telling a reporter there was no Covid there recently went viral. Despite Yogi Adityanath’s strongman reputation in Uttar Pradesh, his exhortation to maintain safety protocols during Holi seemed to fall on many deaf ears. People are tired of a year of safety protocols or lulled by the dip in numbers at the end of 2020 or both. But now that the second wave has truly landed, mixed messages from the political leaders do not help. While the PM exhorts us to not let down our guard, we just hear \"no lockdown\". The prime minister in his message about the second wave has reiterated the focus needs to be on “test, track, treat, Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid management”. That’s commendable. But perhaps the time has come for politicians of all parties, not just the aam aadmi, to also exhibit that “Covid-appropriate behaviour”.

deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product was in double digits for more than a year was during World War II. Joe Biden was just an infant. Few had heard of Harry Truman. As Biden approaches his first 100 days as president, the sheer size of his throw of the dice is starting to sink in.\\xa0 As a share of the US economy, Biden’s fiscal expansion is many times larger than Lyndon Johnson’s “guns and butter” spending, which ushered in the nation’s most recent era of high inflation. Nobody can be sure whether Biden’s roughly US$5 trillion in new spending will lead to runaway inflation. Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, puts the risk of inflation at about a third. He gives the same odds to the prospect that America will continue to enjoy non-inflationary growth. For what it is worth, the US bond market’s inflation expectations have leapt in the past few weeks. But neither the bond markets nor most economists foresaw the era of inflation that began in the late 1960s or the “great moderation” that replaced it in the 1980s. The fact that Biden is taking a risk is not in doubt. It is the composition of his gamble that is open to question. Biden put most of his fiscal chips on the US$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed last month. That was a stimulative bill for an economy that did not need much more aggregate demand. It came on top of more than US$3 trillion of stimulus last year. By comparison, his proposed US$2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, better known as the infrastructure bill, which he proposed last week, is small. The spending, at least half of which has little to do with infrastructure, will be spread out over eight years, which means it will add less than US$300 billion a year in federal investments. Given that Biden’s “build back better” plan was the centrepiece of his campaign, the end result is surprisingly modest. Which leads to the odd situation where both the centrist Summers and the socialist Bernie Sanders are saying almost the same thing. Sanders believes Biden’s infrastructure bill is far too small. Summers believes the stimulus was far too big. Both may be right at the same time. It is worth stressing that investment spending is less inflationary than stimulus as, in principle, it boosts long-term productivity growth. What is the political risk? Biden’s logic was that it was better to make the first bill as large as possible as he may not get a second chance. That may turn out to be true. It is still unclear what price moderate Democrats, such as Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, will demand for supporting his infrastructure bill. The deal could unravel over the proposed corporate tax increases that would partly fund it. It could also come unstuck over demands that state income tax rebates be restored to wealthy taxpayers in Democratic states such as New York (Donald Trump removed most of them in his 2017 tax bill). Even without the tax increases, Republicans would probably unanimously oppose it. The plan includes US$80 billion in extra funding for Amtrak, the US rail system, which conservatives revile as a form of socialist transport. To give a sense of its size, that sum is roughly a third higher than Britain’s annual defence budget. The bill, nevertheless, would go a long way to correcting decades of under-investment in US roads, bridges, broadband and public housing. Biden’s expected US$1 trillion to US$2 trillion “caring economy” bill, which he is expected to unveil soon, would also make education and worker training more affordable, and would bring US parental leave rights into line with other wealthy nations. All of which is badly needed. None of which will necessarily happen. The risk is that Biden is over-interpreting the times. The pandemic has undoubtedly changed the political weather in the US. It helped defeat Trump. But did coronavirus herald what many observers insist is the demise of neoliberalism? That remains to be seen. If Biden has overshot and the US Federal Reserve is forced to apply the brakes to control inflation, or new spending leads to a string of white elephant projects that lessen trust in government, Republicans would reap the downside. In which case Biden’s new era could turn into a one-term blip. His gamble is noble and could pay off.

The penalty, equivalent to around 4 per cent\\xa0of Alibaba\\'s revenues in 2019, comes amid an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on the home-grown technology conglomerates in the last few months that have weighed on company shares. Alibaba\\'s billionaire founder Jack Ma\\'s business empire has been particularly put under intense scrutiny after his stinging criticism of China\\'s regulatory system in late October. In late December, China\\'s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced it launched an anti-trust probe into the company. That came after authorities halted a planned US$37 billion IPO from Ant Group, Alibaba\\'s Internet finance arm. SAMR said on Saturday that after an investigation launched in December, it had determined that Alibaba had been \"abusing market dominance\" since 2015 by preventing its merchants from using other online e-commerce platforms. It said the practice violates China\\'s anti-monopoly law by hindering the free circulation of goods and infringing on the business interests of merchants. The SAMR ordered Alibaba to make \"thorough rectifications\" to strengthen internal compliance and protect consumer rights. \"This penalty will be viewed as a closure to the anti-monopoly case for now by the market. It\\'s indeed the highest profile anti-monopoly case in China,\" said Hong Hao, head of research BOCOM International in Hong Kong. \"The market has been anticipating some sort of penalty for some time ... but people need to pay attention to the measures beyond the anti-monopoly investigation, such as the divestment of media assets.\" Alibaba said in a statement posted on its official Weibo account that it \"accepted\" the decision and would resolutely implement SAMR\\'s rulings. It said it would also work to improve corporate compliance. The Chinese e-commerce giant said it will hold a conference call on Monday to discuss the penalty decision. Alibaba had come under fire in the past from rivals and sellers for allegedly forbidding its merchants from listing on other e-commerce platforms. The practice of preventing merchants from listing on rival platforms is a long-standing one, and the regulator spelt out in rules issued in February that it was illegal. \"The fine bill is a milestone and road sign with great importance,\" Shi Jianzhong, antitrust consultant committee member of the State Council and professor of China University of Political Science and Law, wrote in state-backed Economic Times. \"It indicates that the antitrust law enforcement on internet platforms has entered a new era, and released clear policy signal.\"', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='b7bc4b6d-df47-4f41-972f-c98a009c6046', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'Business', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/aramco-agrees-us-12-4-billion-deal-sell-stake-in-pipelines-14599450', 'title': 'Aramco agrees to US$12.4 billion deal to sell stake in pipelines', 'published_date': '11 Apr 2021 07:55AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='DUBAI: Saudi oil producer Aramco has agreed to a US$12.4 billion deal to sell a 49 per cent\\xa0stake in its pipelines to a consortium led by US-based EIG Global Energy Partners.

In the present order, the Supreme Court accepted the central government’s argument that the principle of non-refoulement is not binding on India as it is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention. So it seems the Supreme Court completely overlooked existing jurisprudence which supports the claim that the principle of non-refoulement forms a part of Article 21 of the Constitution. In the order, the court says that “national courts can draw upon international conventions/treaties, so long as they are not in conflict with municipal law.\" However, it stopped right there. In India, there is no law that clearly prohibits the application of non-refoulment. Therefore, the court could’ve “drawn inspiration” from various international conventions, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), which espouse the principle of non-refoulement. The Supreme Court’s refusal to comment on the situation in Myanmar underpins the injustice served in allowing deportation of Rohingya refugees. The petitioners were not against deportation, they just did not want to be sent back to a country where they face an imminent threat of persecution. Therefore, by refusing to comment on the situation in Myanmar the Supreme Court completely negated the petitioners\\' primary reason for approaching the court. The Supreme Court has reasoned that the issue of deportation in the present case does not fall under Article 21 (right to life and liberty), but under Article 19(1)(e) (to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India). This reasoning is flawed for two reasons: a. The case of the petitioners is not about seeking a complete prohibition on deportation to any state. They just did not want to be deported to Myanmar, where they face an imminent threat of persecution. Therefore, the petitioners did not claim a right to reside or settle in any part of India, but simply protection of their right to life. b. In the landmark case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, the Supreme Court had clearly observed that the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution form a “golden triangle” and cannot be interpreted disjunctively. The 6-page long judgment of the Supreme Court in the present case seems to be based more on unfounded rhetoric peddled by the central government than on a reasoned assessment of human rights. When a court of law relies on rhetorical claims instead of evidence on record for making a judgment, it amounts to a gross “miscarriage of justice”. It is unbecoming of a constitutional court to shy away from adequately addressing the concerns of those seeking protection of their right to life. The least a court of such a stature should’ve done is to give reasoning that is not flawed, that is not contrary to its own jurisprudence, and which privileges due process over prejudicial rhetoric.

Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31. He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. \\xa0 The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country.

In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said. \\x93What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border.

The electoral discourse in Bengal, where poll battles are fought on ideological lines, had in the past mostly steered clear of sub-nationalism like identity politics. \"This is for the first time we have made Bengali pride our main poll plank. Bengali pride is not just about Bengalis; it appeals to all sons of the soil,\" senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy told PTI. \\xa0 Another senior TMC leader said \"divisive politics and religious polarisation can be countered with sub-nationalism and regionalism.\" BJP has blamed Trinamool Congress for bringing up the issue of Bengali pride saying it is harping on nationalism, development and identity politics as it senses defeat in its citadel. \"BJP is in power in so many states, but we have never tried to impose any language or culture.

It has also been observing the anniversaries of Bengali icons Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Parties cutting across political lines feel that the issue has its pitfalls and will have a cascading effect on the federal structure in the days to come. \\xa0 They agree that sub-nationalism can no longer be ignored in Bengal as it is reflective of the state\\'s socio- political history which has always preferred opposing or challenging the party at the Centre or a bigger political force and have refused submission. Born out of the Congress on January 1, 1998, TMC had adopted the evocative slogan \\'Maa Mati Manush\\' (Mother, Land and People) carefully blending socialism and secularism that countered the then communists and their doctrines. The rise of BJP in Bengal\\'s political map made TMC realise that its socialist slogan was not enough to offset \\'Hindutva\\', especially when it has been branded by the saffron camp as a party that favours only minorities. \\xa0 It then came up with the narrative of Bengali pride and insider versus outsider debate and has it as its main poll and ideological planks. The desecration of the bust of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar during a BJP procession in the last phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, followed by the publication of the final NRC list in Assam in August that year gave TMC a golden opportunity to brand BJP as an \"anti-Bengali\" party. The NRC list had left out the names of 19 lakh people in Assam, many of them Bengalis. The state BJP\\'s over-dependence on the party\\'s central leadership with leaders from other states calling the shots have not helped matters for the saffron party. It has in fact further fuelled the \"insider versus outsider\" debate. \\xa0 BJP national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya feels that TMC is only interested in winning the votes and has nothing to do with Bengali pride. \"These are gimmicks to win the election. Everybody knows how concerned TMC is about Bengalis and their welfare,\" he said.

It also promised a Gurudev Centre for Cultural Excellence and a film city was promised named after matinee idol Uttam Kumar. \\xa0 TMC has blamed the ascent of BJP in Bengal\\'s political sphere and the increased activities of far-right Hindu outfits which are more in sync with north Indian culture for the politicisation of ethnic sentiments in the state. But a quick look at post-Idependence Bengal\\'s socio- political history shows how Bengali sub-nationalism has always played a role before going dormant in the past few decades. The effect of sub-nationalism in the state was first felt when Congress led by the then chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy in the mid-fifties lost the election to nine municipalities and an assembly by-poll on the issue of merger of West Bengal and Bihar. \\xa0 The Left Front and Praja Socialist Party had then opposed it tooth and nail stating that Bengalis would beome a minority post the merger. Till the mid \\'90S the issue of Bengali pride was not overtly brought into play, as both the mainstream political parties - the Congress ande CPI(M) had several homegrown stalwarts. There were leaders like Jyoti Basu, Bhupesh Gupta, Indrajit Gupta from the Left and Siddartha Sankar Ray, Pranab Mukherjee, A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury from the Congress. However, the CPI(M), which over the years has moulded itself as a party of the Bengali bhadralok (gentleman) through its anti-Congress and anti-Centre stance, smacked of subtle sub-nationalism by often citing \\'Centre\\'s oppression against Bengal\\'. \\xa0 Noted Historian Sugata Bose contends that sub- nationalism was always in the play in Bengal politics in a covert manner. \"The issue of Bengali sub-nationalism was there in post-Independence Bengal, though in a very subtle way. It was never a major rallying point. The Left\\'s constant attack on the Centre and Congress alleging step-motherly treatment towards Bengal was aimed in that direction. \"But after the formation of TMC in 1998, Bengali sub-nationalism was never an issue as the party and the Bengal CPI-M which it defeated were regional players,\" Bose, the Gardiner Professor of Oceanic history at Harvard University, told PTI. \\xa0 \"It is now back as a major poll issue as TMC, a regional party is fighting against BJP, a national party. It has gained momentum as BJP does not have strong homegrown leaders in Bengal and is overdependent on central leaders,\" he said. Several outfits like Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha have emerged in the state\\'s political landscape and they have accused the saffron camp of trying to \"impose Hindi and north Indian culture\" on Bengal. \"The way Bengalis are demographically threatened by non-Bengalis, the day is not far when they will turn into a minority in their own land. This will not only be just in terms of population but also culturally. We are happy that Bengali sub-nationalism has emerged as a rallying point in this polls,\" Kaushik Maiti, a senior leader of Bangla Pokkho, told PTI. \\xa0 These outfits have been raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state. The narrative has its drawbacks as it alienates the Hindi-speaking population, who are a deciding factor in at least 30 of the state\\'s 294 Assembly seats. Sensing this, the TMC has tied up with the RJD and Samajwadi Party for the assembly polls. The two parties have offered unconditional support to it and will campaign for TMC in the Hindi-speaking belts of the state. Political analyst Suman Bhattacharya feels that Bengali sub-nationalism will play an important role in the assembly poll and will be a deciding factor in several seats. \\xa0 \"It had never played such a major role in the polls. But Bengali pride and sub-nationalism will play a pivotal role this election and a decisive role in several seats,\" he said. Poll analyst Biswanth Chakraborty believes that Bengali sub-nationalism is an urban phenomenon and will not impact rural Bengal.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='d80d3201-046b-40a8-b78a-d7ff6b79dbeb', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'Business', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/eu-michel-says-covid-19-recovery-fund-is-sufficient-report-14599386', 'title': \"EU's Michel says COVID-19 recovery fund is sufficient: Report\", 'published_date': '11 Apr 2021 07:39AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='PARIS: The European Union\\'s COVID-19 recovery response is robust and does not fall short when compared with the United States\\' US$1.9 trillion recovery plan, European Council President Charles Michel told Les Echos newspaper.

Fishermen have long complained that the cheap imports were strangling local trade. The coronavirus has slowed Chinese imports. Nervous customers have turned to local fish. But Kenya will soon face shortages unless imports from China resume; it produces just over a third of what it consumes. \\xa0 Kenyan fishermen like 38-year-old Maurice Misodhi, whose skin has been weathered by the sun and wind during two decades on the water, have had a bumper month. Based at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, customers want every fish he catches. Misodhi says the Chinese lockdown seemed to have dried up imports of cheaper Chinese fish. \"As fishermen we can now smile, not because people are suffering from coronavirus, but because we can now sell our fish, and at a good price,\" he said. The price of a kilo of Nile perch - 250 shillings ($2.50) a month ago - has shot up to 350 shillings. Fish trader Mary Didi usually buys from Chinese suppliers but has now turned to Misodhi. \"The supply at the Chinese importers has gone down, and many of my customers were also scared of the Chinese fish, thinking they would contract the virus,\" she said. \"To keep the business running, I had to turn to fish from the lake.\" Bob Otieno, chairman of Dunga Beach Management Unit, says sales have shot up. The beach registers a catch of between 1 and 1.5 tonnes of fish each day and sales have gone up from 50% of the catch to 90% in the last two weeks. Previously, fishermen would eat, barter or give away around half their catch. \"We used to have many fishermen sell their catch at low prices because of competition from the Chinese fish,\" he said. Kenya produces 180,000 tonnes per year but consumes about 500,000 tonnes, according to 2019 government figures. Christine Adhiambo, the government\\'s assistant director of fisheries for the lake region, said the two biggest importers of Chinese fish had not shipped from China since November and were running down stocks.

Jayakumar, also the AIADMK organising secretary, scripted his own success in remaining as the MLA of Royapuram Assembly constituency for a quarter of a century, inflicting humiliating defeats on successive DMK and Congress candidates who challenged him. \"DJ Annan,\" (elder brother) as he is affectionately called by his supporters in his constituency, had lost only during the 1996 assembly election to DMK\\'s R Mathivanan, when a strong anti-incumbency swept away the then ruling AIADMK in the hustings. \\xa0 He registered his first impressive win in the 1991 election, trouncing Mathivanan and maintained his winning streak in elections in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016.

Despite its mixed bag of communities, traffic woes of residents of Royapuram assembly constituency have not ended. Fishermen, who play a major role in tilting the scales, are apprehensive of the multi-crore developmental programmes in the coastal villages as these threaten their livelihood opportunities. \"DMK\\'s assurance for a sea bridge project connecting Chennai Port-Thiruvottriyur to eliminate traffic congestion and fasten commercial access to and out of the port is not needed. This will only corrode the livelihood opportunities of the fisher folk,\" says Bharathi Ku, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association (SIFWA). \\xa0 \"What we need is livelihood protection initiatives, not multi-crore projects that eat into our villages,\" he argues. The fishermen are also opposed to establishing desalination plants in the coastal villages. \"The ever increasing population and floating population of at least 50,000 people on an average per day into Royapuram for trading and other activities makes this constituency prone to frequent traffic snarls,besides taxing existing resources,\" 60-year old Jayakumar, who hails from the fishing community, told P T I. \\xa0 Despite being a small area, the density of population is high and streets are narrow in Royapuram. Not less than 3,500 autos make sorties into Royapuram on any given day, Jayakumar, who is also an advocate, claims. \"So this calls for implementing a master plan to meet the increasing requirements of the people.

Page Six confirmed that the Duchess of Sussex who is is due to give birth to the couple’s second child, a girl, in early summer will stay home in California on her doctor’s advice, Buckingham Palace announced. Infact, a source close to the royals said that Markle hoped to be at his husband’s side, but the trip and the 12-hour flight were deemed potentially too taxing. \"The Duke of Sussex is planning to attend. The Duchess of Sussex has been advised by her physician not to travel. So the duke will be attending,\" a royal spokesman said at a press briefing, using Harry’s other title. Buckingham Palace announced on Friday (April 9) that Philip, the longtime husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died \"peacefully\" at Windsor Castle at the age of 99, just two months short of his 100th birthday. Philip became the queen’s consort, or official companion, after her father, King George VI, suddenly passed in 1952. He was the longest-serving British consort over his 73-year marriage to the queen.\\xa0 Gun salutes were fired earlier on Saturday across the UK, in Gibraltar and at sea in memory of the duke, who was a senior figure in the navy before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.\\xa0 (With ANI inputs)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='bbb13175-d8f9-45a5-bd59-aa5523958370', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/egyptian-security-forces-allegedly-torture-detain-children-in-direct-violation-of-law-288126', 'title': 'Egyptian security forces allegedly torture, detain children in direct violation of law', 'published_date': 'New Delhi, India', 'language': 'en'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='The Egyptian police force, in tandem with the National Security Agency has been accused of forced disappearances, torture of children. Human Rights Watch and Belady: An Island for Humanity in report which was released today claim that the legal system ignored the abuse. The report titled “No one cared he was a child: Egyptian Security Forces’ Abuse of Children in Detention” claims 20 children aged 12-17 were arrested and abused by forces. “The harrowing accounts of these children and their families reveal how Egypt’s machinery of repression has subjected children to grave abuses,” said Aya Hijazi, co-director of Belady.\\xa0 “Egyptian authorities act as though they are above all laws when it comes to children in detention”, Hijazi added. Based on the account mentioned on the Human Rights Watch website, 15 out of 20 children claim to have been tortured during interrogation. A child was also badly assaulted during the process. As many as seven children claim that they were tortured using sophisticated electricity driven tools like stun guns. “Egyptian authorities act as though they are above all laws when it comes to children in detention”, Hijazi added. Many children were tied with arms behind their backs which led to the dislocation of their shoulders. A 14-year-old boy claimed that his joints had be put back into place with manipulation from another prison, who is allegedly a doctor. Many human rights abuses have been reported under the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Even though most abuse was allegedly committed by the National Security Agency’s officers, the police and army have also been complicit. \\xa0 “Children are describing being waterboarded and electrocuted on their tongues and genitals, and yet Egypt’s security forces are facing no consequences,” said Bill Van Esveld, associate children’s rights director at Human Rights Watch.\\xa0 Many human rights abuses have been reported under the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Even though most abuse was allegedly committed by the National Security Agency’s officers, the police and army have also been complicit. “Governments that want to end these horrors should end support to Egyptian security services and condition any future agreements on there being real reforms”, Esveld added. Even though children were put into detention, their families were not informed. Many of them were missing in action for over 13 months.\\xa0 A child was given the death sentence, which is in direct violation of international human rights protocols in place. Additionally, three were indefinitely put in solitary confinement. When families tried to reach out to their kids, their requests were denied. Many narratives claim that there was not enough room for everybody to sleep, owing to which most kids slept in shifts. A harrowing account released by Human Rights Watch suggests that kids were threatened were re-detention if they didn’t confess to the crime they were being held for. According to Egyptian law, all detainees have to be presented in front of a prosecutor within 24 hours of taking them into custody. However, the authorities circumvented this law by claiming that the kids were “arrested”. The law states that children cannot be tried before criminal courts, however, two kids were tried in military courts, which clearly disregards the law in place. Under the 1996 Child Law and the subsequent amendments, special protection is accorded to children, and they cannot be detained and penalised along the same lines as adults. A loophole in the Child Law enables officers to send children to criminal courts if their accomplices were adults, which is abused to prosecute children. According to the human rights group, the allies of Egypt, including the US and many European countries need to end their support to the country in order for them to be held accountable for their trespassing.

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.\\xa0 At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.\\xa0 Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='dc9ee4eb-7f0c-49e4-8332-5d649227d60b', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.dnaindia.com', 'section': 'headlines', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.dnaindia.com/personal-finance/report-charge-for-depositing-and-withdrawing-money-in-post-office-account-what-the-rules-say-2885713', 'title': 'Is Post Office charging for depositing, withdrawing money?

She says there was no widespread fraud and that her own party is attacking her for refusing to “put my thumb on the scale of democracy.” Barbara Cegavske, the only Republican statewide office holder in Nevada, said members of her party are disappointed with the election results and believe fraud occurred “despite a complete lack of evidence to support that belief.” Cegavske, who has overseen elections in the state since 2014, has repeatedly defended the results as reliable and accurate despite attacks from and other Republicans. Nevada is among the states where former President Trump sought to subvert results from the\\xa0 \\xa0and conspiracy theories. President Joe Biden defeated Trump in the Western swing state by 2 percentage points, or nearly 34,000 votes. “Regrettably, members of my own political party have decided to censure me simply because they are disappointed with the outcome of the 2020 election. While I have been loyal to the Nevada Republican Party during my over two decades as an elected official, I have been unwavering in my commitment to oversee elections and administer Nevada’s election laws in a neutral, nonpartisan manner,” Cegavske said in a statement Sunday. “My job is to carry out the duties of my office as enacted by the Nevada Legislature, not carry water for the state GOP or put my thumb on the scale of democracy. Unfortunately, members of my own party continue to believe the 2020 general election was wrought with fraud — and that somehow I had a part in it — despite a complete lack of evidence to support that belief.” A GOP official who was unauthorized to speak publicly confirmed to The Associated Press that the measure passed on a 126-112 vote by the party’s governing members at a meeting in the state capital, Carson City. Jessica Hanson, the executive director of the state GOP, sent a statement from the party noting that the censure vote on Saturday “passed narrowly” and said it occurred following “a healthy debate” over the election. “The Nevada Republican Party holds our elected officials to a high standard. As such, this weekend the party sent a clear message that our officials must work for the people and we demand that our representatives at all levels of government uphold their Oath of Office,” the party said. It wasn’t clear from a copy of the censure resolution what punishment the censure entailed. Hanson did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the punishment. In March, Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald presented four boxes to Cegavske’s office that he and other Republican leaders said contained proof of more than 120,000 instances of voter fraud. But Cegavske\\xa0 \\xa0Election Integrity Violation reports submitted. Her office said a number of those reports were already under investigation by her office and it was reviewing the others reports to determine if an investigation was warranted.

He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War.

Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities.

The 57-year-old Black woman from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, feared that her high blood pressure and diabetes might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. Then a member of Pringle’s church, a local NAACP leader who has led a vaccination campaign targeting Black residents, urged her to reconsider. He shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. “That’s what made me change my mind,” said Pringle, who finally agreed to an appointment to get her first shot Thursday. “I had to pray about it. And I felt better after that.” Campaigns aimed at Black communities across the US are making headway in the effort to persuade people that the vaccines are safe and effective. With millions of dollars in assistance from President Joe Biden’s administration, local groups have urged Black Americans to roll up their sleeves for shots and set aside what for some is a shared historical distrust of science and government. A poll by for Public Affairs Research in late March found that about 24 percent of Black American adults said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. That’s down from 41 percent in January. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots in almost the same proportion as white Americans at 26 percent and Hispanic Americans at 22 percent. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken “almost a 180-degree turnaround” as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. He credited Black physicians, faith leaders and other community organisers for being trusted messengers during the pandemic, which has killed more than 5,50,000 Americans. “It’s the messenger and the message,” but the messenger “is probably the most important part of it, and people doing it in a way that wasn’t preachy,” Benjamin said. “They didn’t tell people, ‘You need to get vaccinated because it’s your duty.’ They basically said, ‘Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family.’” Some of the most effective outreach has relied on existing community relationships, such as local physicians talking about their own decisions to get vaccinated, to reassure the public, said Dr Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. Community members in the Baltimore area who knew Cooper from her research on food deserts and nutrition trusted her as a source of information on , she said. Based on that relationship, “people felt comfortable hearing from me,” she said. Some state health departments have rolled out ads targeting communities of color. NAACP chapters in some cities have booked appointments for people to get shots. Pastors of Black churches have urged their parishioners to take the vaccines. In Brunswick, Georgia, the Rev John Perry and another Black pastor put their faces on a billboard promoting the vaccines, and postcards with a similar image were mailed to residents. Both efforts were produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. “I think we still have enough people on the fence that are going to budge and get their shots,” said Perry, who initially wanted to wait a year before getting his shots but changed his mind after reading up on how the vaccines were developed. He got his second dose Wednesday. Jason Pettibone, a Black barber in Perry’s coastal Georgia community, remains hesitant. His parents and sister have all been vaccinated with no ill effects. Yet Pettibone said the stories he hears from customers — including one who swore his father lost all feeling in the right side of his body after getting a shot — have made it hard to overcome his uncertainty. “I’m thinking in my head not only would it be good for me to get it, because I don’t want to get sick myself, but also to protect other people who come into the shop,” Pettibone said. “But it’s the unknown. Everybody’s really scared of the unknown.” In Savannah, Georgia, community activist Natavia Sanders said outreach efforts can backfire with some in the Black community who suspect the government is targeting them as test subjects rather than seeking to protect their health. Some of that skepticism can be traced to an infamous study in Tuskegee, Alabama, where the government let hundreds of Black men suffer untreated syphilis for 40 years for research purposes. Sanders declined to say whether she was getting vaccinated. She said she’s spoken with several people who had to be hospitalised with but still have doubts about the vaccines. “That’s how skeptical people are,” Sanders said. “They’re like, ‘No, I’ll fight it myself. I fought it already.’” PM Browner got her vaccine Wednesday in Clarksdale, Mississippi. The 88-year-old Black woman said she doesn’t understand why she needs to get vaccinated if she’s not sick or around sick people. Still, she agreed to get her shot. She said she thinks vaccinations will eventually be required, and she wants to be able to continue to socialise at a local senior center. “If you ain’t got nothing, why do we need to take it?” Browner said. “But we’ll take it because later on, they’ll say, ‘You’ve got to take it.’ If you don’t, later on, I think we’ll have to.”', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='8db0c894-7e45-41a8-a7f4-8ae969a07255', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/090421/odisha-covid-negative-report-or-final-vaccination-certificate-mandatory-for-entry.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\": The new guidelines issued by the Odisha government on Friday in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases, make it mandatory for people coming to the state to produce either a negative RT-PCR test report obtained within 72 hours of entry or final vaccination certificate after two doses of vaccination.

What he meant was, all the resources in this world won’t make you successful if you don’t have a hunger for planning for your success, especially investing in the financial markets. Sahen was one of the few Economists who had sensed the Blood in the market way before it wounded. Sahen had predicted and cautioned about a crash in the markets through his social media handle with an unrealistic fall of 2600 points target which later turned out to be a reality. (Link: ). Sahen had even predicted a strong rebound and vigorously pushed investors to invest… now we all know how we regret and crave for the march levels again. (Link: ). Growing up, Sahen recalls business channels as screens displaying green and red arrows on which he used to bet on, with his father. He said, “As I grew up, I began learning more about the uses of the financial markets. From my father using financial markets to make his investments, to the companies using these funds for expansion and development. Learning these aspects of Financial markets familiarised me with the sheer amount of power and versatility these markets possessed”. He soon began to find traces of financial markets everywhere that he looked from MNC’s to employees, investment to speculation, DII to FII, saving to economic development; every economic variable relied on financial markets to operate. Claiming to be a turning point in his life, he said, “My friend once told me ‘Yeh Company ke share lele bahut kamayega’ (Buy this share, you will make a lot). At first, I got carried away, but I had my doubts about whether or not it would work. I spent the night researching online and learning more about the suggested company, and by the next morning I realized that this was a dooming opportunity with the business having no future prospects.” I decided to back out on my Investment. Though I was right in the long-run, but my friend did make money in that stock in the short-run… it was that day I understood that the market don’t believe in tit for tat…numbers don’t dictate the stock price…the market sentiment decides. Numbers just tell you which stock to buy, but when to buy is the place where market sentiment walks in. On being asked, What does it take to become a successful wealth manager? He said, “People will say investment strategies, plan, contacts, luck, etc but No…it all comes down to one word ‘Trust’, the trust that I have in my investment suggestion, and the trust that investors have in me. There will be times when things don’t go your way, that’s natural buts that when you have to be there with your investors and face it out… rather than shying away like most of the wealth managers do and losing their trust. NEVER BREAK ANYONE’S TRUST IN LIFE. It takes 30 years to build a reputation and ten minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.” Going forward on the Indian Growth story He said, “I never saw the Indian long-term growth story endangered. Despite, the initial contraction by almost 24% in the first quarter due to covid, we have recovered well to reach the minimal shrink of 7.5% in Quarter 2. Moving ahead, we continue to see huge potential in India in the long run and believe our growth story is intact. And it’s not just I who believe soo… it’s also accepted by others, who are ready to invest in India. We expect the country to witness a ‘V’ shaped recovery post the vaccine roll-out.

Teams from New Zealand and Australia haven’t played each other since March when the full Super Rugby competition was abandoned because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2021 season will see a continuation of the successful Super Rugby Aotearoa competition involving home-and-away matches among New Zealand’s five Super Rugby teams, this time with a one-off final added. That tournament might then be followed by a series of crossovers between the New Zealand teams and Australia’s five Super Rugby teams, which likely will have completed their own domestic tournament. The establishment of that competition depends on a cooling of the currently heated relationship between Australian and New Zealand rugby unions. New Zealand Rugby is eager to added a Pacific Island team from 2022, to be based in South Auckland, and has received expressions of interests from several potential team organizations. Introducing that team in 2021 is unlikely because recruitment for next season is already underway and that would place the Pacifika team at a disadvantage. The 2022 Super Rugby tournament would comprise a minimum of eight teams, including the Pacific team.

After the 16th over, we had two good overs but overall we could have been slightly better. “Nobody wants to drop catches but at this level, we need to draw a line and say these catches that need to be taken, especially when the team hasn’t been doing that outstandingly well,” he said, referring to the spilled chances when SRH’s Abhishek Sharma was batting. “Catches like these can hamper your knockout stage games. It is very important to be at your best. There are plenty of positives in this game but we will try to come back strong.” SRH skipper David Warner took a big gamble by asking 18-year old Abdul Samad to bowl the final over when CSK needed 28 runs. The Australian defended his decision. “I backed him (Samad). I had no option. We tried to kill the game in the 19th over with Khaleel there with five balls to bowl. Could have given it to Abhishek, but Samad with his height and the way he bowled tonight, he had to bowl the last one,” said Warner. He also praised Proyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma for their gritty batting under pressure. “It’s my message to the youngsters, to go out their and score some runs. These guys assessed the conditions and played well, so really really proud of.

Genocide, the nations declared, was “condemned by the civilized world” and justified intervention in the affairs of sovereign states. Now, a small but growing number of world leaders including Pope Francis and French President Emmanuel Macron have begun citing an offense they say poses a similar threat to humanity and remains beyond the reach of international criminal law: ecocide, or widespread destruction of the environment. The pope describes ecocide as “the massive contamination of air, land and water,” or “any action capable of producing an ecological disaster,” and it a sin for Roman Catholics. The Pontiff has also endorsed a campaign by environmental activists and legal scholars to make ecocide the fifth crime before the International Criminal Court in The Hague as a legal deterrent to the kinds of far-reaching environmental damage that are driving mass extinction, ecological collapse and climate change. The monumental step, which faces a long road of global debate, would mean political leaders and corporate executives could face charges and imprisonment for \"ecocidal\" acts. To make their case, advocates point to the Amazon, where fires raged out of control in 2019, and where the rainforest may now be so degraded than it draws in. At the poles, human activity is thawing a frozen Arctic and destabilizing the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Across the globe, climate change is disrupting the reliable seasonal rhythms that have sustained human life for millennia, while hurricanes, floods and other climate-driven disasters have in the last six months. Fossil fuel pollution has annually in recent years, according to a study in Environmental Research, more than tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS combined. One in 4 mammals . For amphibians, it’s 4 in 10. Damage to nature has become so extensive and widespread around the world that many environmentalists speak of ecocide to describe numerous environmentally devastated hot spots: The campaign to criminalize ecocide is now moving from the fringe of advocacy into global diplomacy, pushed by a growing recognition among advocates and many political leaders that climate change and environmental causes are tied inherently to human rights and social justice. The effort remains a long shot and is at least years from fruition, international and environmental law experts say. Advocates will have to navigate political tensions over whether national governments or the international community have ultimate control over natural resources. And they’ll likely face opposition from countries with high carbon emissions and deep ties to industrial development. The environmentalists must also figure out how criminal law would address climate change, which has been driven by practices like burning coal and gasoline that are not only legal, but central to the global economy. The campaign to make ecocide a crime, however, is about more than law. Jojo Mehta, who launched the Stop Ecocide campaign in 2017 with Polly Higgins, a Scottish lawyer who died in 2019, describes it as a moral and practical issue as well. “We use criminal law to draw moral lines,” Mehta said. “We say something’s not accepted, your murder is not acceptable. And so, simply putting mass damage and destruction of nature below that red line actually makes a huge difference, and it will make a difference to the people that are financing what is going on.” Scott W. Badenoch Jr., an American environmental lawyer who favors the criminalization of ecocide, used the term to describe the state, and fate, of the Earth. “Ecocide is now endemic all over the planet,” he said. “The structures of ecology that have held up living organisms on Earth, since time immemorial, are collapsing everywhere.” He added, “Ecocide is now, frankly, the process that we are living in on Earth.” The concept of ecocide was born of tragedy. Over a period of 10 years, the United States government sprayed of powerful herbicides, including Agent Orange, across the countryside in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to expose enemy sanctuaries during the Vietnam War. The dioxin-laced chemicals defoliated verdant jungle and caused cancers, neurological disease and birth defects in people living nearby. While the number of victims is disputed, there are more than 3 million. In 1970, Yale biologist Arthur Galston invoked the destruction to call on the world to outlaw what he called “ecocide.” More than 20 years later, the global community came together to form the International Criminal Court, which was formally established in 2002 under a treaty called the Rome Statute to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes when its member countries, which currently , fail to do so themselves. Early drafts of the Rome Statute included the crime of environmental destruction, after opposition from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, based on various concerns, including that it wasn’t precisely defined. Instead, it was relegated to a wartime offense that has never been enforced. As a result, international criminal law includes few guardrails to prevent peacetime environmental destruction. “There\\'s a big gap and something needs to fill it,” said Badenoch, a visiting attorney at the Environmental Law Institute. “We currently cannot hold big corporations or big governments accountable for ecocide,” Badenoch added. “So, what do you do? We name and shame — that\\'s all we\\'ve got.” Decades of oil extraction in Nigeria by subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell, for example, have in parts of the country with benzene and other toxic pollutants, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Civil lawsuits have taken years to wind through European courts, and no laws were strong enough to prevent the damage from happening, though Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary was recently . Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, that says many of the spills have come as a result of sabotage and theft, and that the company has been working with stakeholders to clean up the pollution identified by the U.N. Environment Program. The International Criminal Court\\'s supranational authority would make an ecocide crime particularly powerful, said Kate Mackintosh, executive director of the Promise Institute for Human Rights at the University of California Los Angeles. An ecocide crime would require International Criminal Court members to enact their own national ecocide laws, and failure to enforce those laws would enable the international court to step in. While political leaders and warlords have been the usual targets of the court, an ecocide crime could place business executives on notice, too. “That could make a difference in corporate boardroom conversations,” Mackintosh said. Even the threat of being labeled an international criminal, she said, might deter destructive corporate behavior. “I mean, for PR, it doesn’t look good, does it?” Mackintosh said making ecocide a crime could help in weak states, where corporate polluters are sometimes more powerful than national governments. “The likelihood of any criminal prosecution taking place in that state is pretty low,” she said. “But with an international crime, that’s actually not a bar.” China, the United States, India and Russia — four of the world’s top polluters — are not members of the International Criminal Court, but if a corporation based in one of those countries were to operate within a member state, as many of them do, their executives could fall under the court’s jurisdiction. The push to criminalize ecocide remained on the periphery until December 2019, when Vanuatu and the Maldives, two island nations threatened by rising seas and climate change-driven extreme weather, recommended that the court consider amending its statute to “criminalize acts that amount to ecocide.” “Our legacy and our future are at stake,” Vanuatu’s ambassador to the European Union, John Licht, , stressing a “common bond” that united all the world’s people. “Our lives are intertwined by the environment we live in.” Willy Missack, who has served as part of Vanuatu’s delegation to the United Nations climate negotiations, said diplomats from other countries expressed shock when “little tiny Vanuatu” — a remote archipelago of more than 80 islands in the South Pacific — said it wanted to take on global powers and the fossil fuel industry through the courts. But the fact that corporations can continue to profit from carbon emissions that are threatening his country’s future, Missack said, makes the legal case clear. “It is not right,” he said, “and this is where justice comes in.” After Vanuatu asked the International Criminal Court to consider criminalizing ecocide, Mehta’s Stop Ecocide Foundation independently convened a panel of international legal experts, including Mackintosh of UCLA, to draft a clear definition of ecocide. They plan to publish their definition in June, at which point they hope at least one of the court’s member nations will formally propose that the court adopt ecocide as the fifth international crime against peace. Mehta has said the definition would likely require of environmental destruction related to practices like widespread logging, drilling, mining and deep-sea trawling. Richard J. Rogers, a British expert in international criminal law who is a partner at Global Diligence and a member of the drafting panel, said it may be relatively straightforward to criminalize certain acts, like destruction of a forest or waterway. But climate change poses a greater challenge: Not only is it difficult to connect polluters to specific harms, he said, but there’s also nothing illegal about extracting or burning fossil fuels. “The situation we\\'re dealing with is that the carbon system, which has fueled our economies since the Industrial Revolution, has not only been lawful, but it\\'s been encouraged,” Rogers said. Another point that the drafters will have to grapple with is whether the crime of ecocide should require prosecutors to prove that humans have been harmed. Mackintosh said that while this “human harm” threshold could prove appealing politically — the court\\'s existing crimes all largely involve harm to humans — focusing ecocide only on the environment could make it easier for prosecutors to prove, especially when it comes to harms related to climate change, which are often incremental and indirect. If a nation agrees to introduce the ecocide proposal to the International Criminal Court for consideration, that is when even harder work will begin. Ratification is a multistep process that would require support from either two-thirds or seven-eighths of the court’s members, depending on the type of amendment introduced. (Vanuatu still supports the campaign, but Covid-19 and the country’s “limited resources for international diplomacy” have put its ecocide advocacy on hold, said Dreli Solomon, a spokesman for Vanuatu’s embassy in Brussels.) While no country has committed to formally proposing that the court adopt ecocide, the campaign is gaining traction, fueled by the youth-led climate movement and radical new groups like Extinction Rebellion. In December, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès asked International Criminal Court member states to of adopting ecocide as a crime. A member of Belgium’s Parliament has also proposed a bill to criminalize ecocide. And French lawmakers are working on legislation to make ecocide an punishable by fines and prison, though Stop Ecocide as “weak.” At least 10 countries have national ecocide laws already, including Vietnam, which enacted the law in 1990. Separately, French lawyers in January filed a request on behalf of Amazonian indigenous groups asking the International Criminal Court to investigate Bolsonaro of Brazil for crimes against humanity. The appeal alleges that deforestation encouraged by Bolsonaro’s government and other policies have forced indigenous people from their homes and even led to murders in the region. While the request relies on citations of crimes the court already addresses, the lawyers who submitted it the case is also an example of ecocide. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said in a statement that \"the Bolsonaro administration is taking concrete action to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples and ensure the future of the Amazon.\" The embassy said that over 70 percent of the eligible Indigenous population has received initial Covid-19 vaccinations and that deforestation rates in the Amazon were 21 percent lower from August to January , compared to the same period a year earlier. Badenoch said that while the hurdles to adopting a new international crime are high, they are not insurmountable. “These things take a long time and they are complex,” he said. “But they can be done.” While the campaign for an ecocide law could take years — if it is successful at all — advocates say the effort could bear fruit much sooner: The ecocide campaign has thrust the concept into public discussion. Mehta doesn’t expect the campaign to catch fire in the United States, but after four years of President Donald Trump, she’s heartened by the arrival of John Kerry, Biden’s special climate envoy. “We don’t expect the U.S. to join the ICC any time soon, but that said, the conversation around ecocide itself, we don’t see any reason why it can’t start happening in the U.S.,” she said. The State Department released a statement saying that the U.S. “regularly engages with other countries” on “the importance of preventing environmental destruction during armed conflict,” but added, “We do not comment on the details of our communications with foreign governments.” Mehta’s campaign is also part of a wider effort by activists who have been looking to the courts to force more aggressive action on climate change. As of July 1, 2020, at least 1,550 climate change cases have been filed in 38 countries, . In 2015, a Dutch court ruled in the Urgenda Climate Case that the government had acted negligently by failing to take aggressive enough action to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the ruling in in 2019 and ordered the government to hit specific emissions reductions targets, sparking a series of similar lawsuits in other countries. In one of those lawsuits, a Paris administrative court for failing to meet its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling relied, in part, on France’s nonbinding commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, taking what had been the soft pledge of politics and turning it into a legally binding commitment. Mehta has framed an ecocide law as a counterweight to the failings of the Paris Agreement, saying in that it offers “a way to correct the shortcomings” of the global climate pact. “Whereas Paris lacks sufficient ambition, transparency and accountability, the criminalization of ecocide would be an enforceable deterrent.” Alex Whiting, a professor at Harvard Law School and former coordinator of prosecutions at the International Criminal Court, said that making ecocide a crime before the court would have tremendous impact, even if only a few cases were actually prosecuted. “When a crime becomes an international crime, it has a ripple effect,” he said. “The environment is the issue of our time. Being able to do something about that seems important.” In Vanuatu, though, there is a sense that the pace of climate change is beginning to outrun the country’s ability to adapt. Cyclones that have devastated the islands are expected to intensify as the globe continues to warm. Missack, the Vanuatu diplomat, said the effects of climate change run much deeper than damage from storms.

Fishermen, who play a major role in tilting the scales, are apprehensive of the multi-crore developmental programmes in the coastal villages as these threaten their livelihood opportunities. \"DMK\\'s assurance for a sea bridge project connecting Chennai Port-Thiruvottriyur to eliminate traffic congestion and fasten commercial access to and out of the port is not needed. This will only corrode the livelihood opportunities of the fisher folk,\" says Bharathi Ku, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association (SIFWA). \\xa0 \"What we need is livelihood protection initiatives, not multi-crore projects that eat into our villages,\" he argues. The fishermen are also opposed to establishing desalination plants in the coastal villages. \"The ever increasing population and floating population of at least 50,000 people on an average per day into Royapuram for trading and other activities makes this constituency prone to frequent traffic snarls,besides taxing existing resources,\" 60-year old Jayakumar, who hails from the fishing community, told P T I. \\xa0 Despite being a small area, the density of population is high and streets are narrow in Royapuram. Not less than 3,500 autos make sorties into Royapuram on any given day, Jayakumar, who is also an advocate, claims. \"So this calls for implementing a master plan to meet the increasing requirements of the people.

The ruling TMC has embraced it as its main poll plank to counter the rise of the BJP\\'s Hindutva narrative in the state. \\xa0 It has branded BJP as a \"party of outsiders\" and has fanned the \\'Bengali pride\\' by coming up with a poll slogan \"Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chai\" (Bengal wants its own daughter) creating a poll narrative of sub-nationalism to counter the saffron party\\'s identity politics. The electoral discourse in Bengal, where poll battles are fought on ideological lines, had in the past mostly steered clear of sub-nationalism like identity politics. \"This is for the first time we have made Bengali pride our main poll plank. Bengali pride is not just about Bengalis; it appeals to all sons of the soil,\" senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy told PTI. \\xa0 Another senior TMC leader said \"divisive politics and religious polarisation can be countered with sub-nationalism and regionalism.\" BJP has blamed Trinamool Congress for bringing up the issue of Bengali pride saying it is harping on nationalism, development and identity politics as it senses defeat in its citadel. \"BJP is in power in so many states, but we have never tried to impose any language or culture. This is a baseless allegation as TMC has nothing to showcase to seek votes,\" BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said. \\xa0 BJP national president J P Nadda claimed at various poll rallies that only BJP can restore the Bengali pride and that \"TMC represents everything that is opposite to it\". To counter the narrative and project itself as a party in sync with Bengali culture and ethos, BJP has propped up Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee as its icon. It has also been observing the anniversaries of Bengali icons Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Parties cutting across political lines feel that the issue has its pitfalls and will have a cascading effect on the federal structure in the days to come. \\xa0 They agree that sub-nationalism can no longer be ignored in Bengal as it is reflective of the state\\'s socio- political history which has always preferred opposing or challenging the party at the Centre or a bigger political force and have refused submission. Born out of the Congress on January 1, 1998, TMC had adopted the evocative slogan \\'Maa Mati Manush\\' (Mother, Land and People) carefully blending socialism and secularism that countered the then communists and their doctrines. The rise of BJP in Bengal\\'s political map made TMC realise that its socialist slogan was not enough to offset \\'Hindutva\\', especially when it has been branded by the saffron camp as a party that favours only minorities. \\xa0 It then came up with the narrative of Bengali pride and insider versus outsider debate and has it as its main poll and ideological planks. The desecration of the bust of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar during a BJP procession in the last phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, followed by the publication of the final NRC list in Assam in August that year gave TMC a golden opportunity to brand BJP as an \"anti-Bengali\" party. The NRC list had left out the names of 19 lakh people in Assam, many of them Bengalis. The state BJP\\'s over-dependence on the party\\'s central leadership with leaders from other states calling the shots have not helped matters for the saffron party. It has in fact further fuelled the \"insider versus outsider\" debate. \\xa0 BJP national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya feels that TMC is only interested in winning the votes and has nothing to do with Bengali pride. \"These are gimmicks to win the election. Everybody knows how concerned TMC is about Bengalis and their welfare,\" he said. To woo the Bengali voters, the saffron party in its poll manifesto promised Tagore Smriti Puraskar on the lines of the Nobel prize to honour globally recognised talents and the Satyajit Ray Award on the lines of the Oscar award. It also promised a Gurudev Centre for Cultural Excellence and a film city was promised named after matinee idol Uttam Kumar. \\xa0 TMC has blamed the ascent of BJP in Bengal\\'s political sphere and the increased activities of far-right Hindu outfits which are more in sync with north Indian culture for the politicisation of ethnic sentiments in the state. But a quick look at post-Idependence Bengal\\'s socio- political history shows how Bengali sub-nationalism has always played a role before going dormant in the past few decades. The effect of sub-nationalism in the state was first felt when Congress led by the then chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy in the mid-fifties lost the election to nine municipalities and an assembly by-poll on the issue of merger of West Bengal and Bihar. \\xa0 The Left Front and Praja Socialist Party had then opposed it tooth and nail stating that Bengalis would beome a minority post the merger. Till the mid \\'90S the issue of Bengali pride was not overtly brought into play, as both the mainstream political parties - the Congress ande CPI(M) had several homegrown stalwarts. There were leaders like Jyoti Basu, Bhupesh Gupta, Indrajit Gupta from the Left and Siddartha Sankar Ray, Pranab Mukherjee, A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury from the Congress. However, the CPI(M), which over the years has moulded itself as a party of the Bengali bhadralok (gentleman) through its anti-Congress and anti-Centre stance, smacked of subtle sub-nationalism by often citing \\'Centre\\'s oppression against Bengal\\'. \\xa0 Noted Historian Sugata Bose contends that sub- nationalism was always in the play in Bengal politics in a covert manner. \"The issue of Bengali sub-nationalism was there in post-Independence Bengal, though in a very subtle way. It was never a major rallying point. The Left\\'s constant attack on the Centre and Congress alleging step-motherly treatment towards Bengal was aimed in that direction. \"But after the formation of TMC in 1998, Bengali sub-nationalism was never an issue as the party and the Bengal CPI-M which it defeated were regional players,\" Bose, the Gardiner Professor of Oceanic history at Harvard University, told PTI. \\xa0 \"It is now back as a major poll issue as TMC, a regional party is fighting against BJP, a national party. It has gained momentum as BJP does not have strong homegrown leaders in Bengal and is overdependent on central leaders,\" he said. Several outfits like Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha have emerged in the state\\'s political landscape and they have accused the saffron camp of trying to \"impose Hindi and north Indian culture\" on Bengal. \"The way Bengalis are demographically threatened by non-Bengalis, the day is not far when they will turn into a minority in their own land. This will not only be just in terms of population but also culturally. We are happy that Bengali sub-nationalism has emerged as a rallying point in this polls,\" Kaushik Maiti, a senior leader of Bangla Pokkho, told PTI. \\xa0 These outfits have been raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state. The narrative has its drawbacks as it alienates the Hindi-speaking population, who are a deciding factor in at least 30 of the state\\'s 294 Assembly seats. Sensing this, the TMC has tied up with the RJD and Samajwadi Party for the assembly polls. The two parties have offered unconditional support to it and will campaign for TMC in the Hindi-speaking belts of the state. Political analyst Suman Bhattacharya feels that Bengali sub-nationalism will play an important role in the assembly poll and will be a deciding factor in several seats. \\xa0 \"It had never played such a major role in the polls. But Bengali pride and sub-nationalism will play a pivotal role this election and a decisive role in several seats,\" he said.

New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. “If you don’t insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others?” he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedy’s Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever — Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Truman’s attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clark’s client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers. There were usually two to three dozen active cases on Clark’s legal calendar, and about 100 more in the background. Capital punishment cases were a staple. “We talk about civil liberties,” he said. “We have the largest prison population per capita on Earth.

Here's Why I Terrorized My Classmates.\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Recently, a friend and I were talking about our childhoods, and how so many of our early experiences shape the complicated adults we become. How we can become triggered by seemingly innocuous events and find ourselves reacting to situations in unexpected and often irrational ways. He told me about being bullied in high school and how he does not think he will ever fully recover from the trauma of those years. He said he has “learned to deal with it” and “found a way to move on,” but that it still affects him every day and that he will never forgive the people who “tore his life to shreds.” His words and the pain on his face hit me hard. They brought to mind my own childhood, specifically my preteen years, when I was a bully. I have spent the better part of 40 years “forgetting” those days ― the people I have hurt, the damage I’ve done and the trauma I’ve caused. It all came flooding back. I thought, I did not start out as a bully. It was a choice. I was a good kid ― smart, funny and full of life. That all changed in the middle of sixth grade when I was 11 years old.\\xa0 I remember the moment with absolute clarity: It was during a recess break when I was wrestling with one of my classmates. He was one of the boys in my school who was maturing more quickly than the others, including myself. He was tall and ripped. He had the beginnings of a mangy mustache and a voice as deep as Darth Vader’s. He had me on the ground and was straddling my chest. My arms were pinned above my head. We were laughing. He smiled at me. I got an erection. It was the first time I experienced pure panic. I froze. Time stood still as he felt me against him and recognition swept across his face. I heard the words “holy shit” and “faggot,” and saw his smile disappear. I threw him off of me and ran. A single thought followed me: From an early age, I knew that I was different from other boys, but I did not know that I was gay. I knew full well what being gay meant ― it’s hard to grow up in a small town full of machismo and testosterone and not know what being gay meant. I also knew what a “faggot” was and what a “queer” and a “butt pirate” were and all of those other colorful terms. I knew I couldn’t be any of these things. I believed that being gay was bad ― possibly the worst thing that someone could be. I knew it would get you ostracized, mercilessly bullied and beaten to a pulp. I also knew that it could get you killed. My decision to “not be gay” began that day. The change from happy-go-lucky preteen to disgruntled, petulant asshole happened virtually overnight. As the fear of being discovered began to consume my every waking moment, I set about to obliterate the old me and create someone new. I lived in a kill-or-be-killed world, where the tough feasted on the weak, and where being different made you a target. It was a world where only the strong survived, where you were either predator or prey. I knew people who were prey. They were different, and I thought they were weak. I saw what a living hell their lives were. I witnessed the endless torture they endured at the hands of the more popular kids ― the name-calling and the constant mental and physical abuse and how it affected them. This was not a life for me. In the course of just a few short months, I went from a bright, engaged student to an uninterested, disruptive presence in the classroom. My grades plummeted. I became cocky and combative with my peers, I dumped my old friends for a new, tougher crowd and I found myself a girlfriend. I did whatever I could do to deflect the attention away from me and onto somebody else. Thus began the bullying. I was not particularly big or strong for my age, so intimidation by force was not an option for me ― I found friends for that. What I did have was a quick wit and an uncanny ability to find and exploit weaknesses. I became a psychological assassin. For the unfortunate souls who were more noticeable, like the girl with the dark red birthmark on her face or the chubby boy with Coke-bottle glasses, it was easy. For others, I learned what I could about them and then struck when the opportunity presented itself. My most devious move came with Mike, the boy I was wrestling with when this all began. Why he never told anyone about what happened is beyond me. I still wonder why, when presented with such a golden opportunity, he did not expose me. Perhaps he was a decent, compassionate human being? Perhaps he was one of the good guys? Regardless, he did not attack, so I did. I flipped the script and told everyone the erection was his and that he had tried to “stick it in me.” From then on, his nickname was “ass bandit” and his life was hellish. I survived the remaining two years of middle school this way: attacking first, capitalizing on faults and imperfections and ruining lives. It was remarkably easy. The other kids in my school were all too willing to go along with the game because they, like me, had things to hide. Except it was not a game. People were getting hurt and developing emotional scars. I do not remember feeling bad about the suffering I was causing. So governed by the fear of my secret getting out, I ran a scorched-earth campaign against anyone I felt threatened by, consequences be damned. I did not believe I had a choice ― I thought it was a matter of life and death. When I entered high school, I was forced to adapt using new methods of survival. I ended up in a school on the opposite side of the city away from my friends, where I was suddenly a very small fish in a very big pond and nobody was afraid of me. Alone and vulnerable, I learned to blend in, to camouflage and disguise myself, to keep my head down and my mouth shut. Being invisible was easy and a lot less work than being a bully. I concentrated on my classes and on avoiding Chris, one of my classmates.\\xa0\\xa0 Chris Jones was the only “out” gay person in school and the only person I was afraid of. His audacity was overwhelming. How dare he have the strength to be himself, to live an authentic life, to be out and proud and fearless? I would lie awake at night stressing about how easily he could destroy my life. It would only take one glance ― a single moment of recognition ― and everything would come crashing down for me. He would know I was gay, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and he would expose me for the fraud I was. It was equal parts fear and fascination. I longed to be seen ― by him or anyone ― but the terror that elicited was paralyzing. In retrospect, what I really wanted was not to feel so utterly and completely alone.\\xa0 Today, I see the boy who did those terrible things hiding in the darkness near my heart. He is utterly and completely alone. I reach out to him, tell him that I love him, but I do not think he believes me. He knows that I am deeply ashamed. He knows that I am broken, and he doesn’t trust that a broken man can fix things. He is anxious and afraid and furtive. He runs.\\xa0 The adult me is all of these things. I battle with depression and a panic disorder. I often do not feel worthy of love. I run. There is a quote by Maya Angelou that reads, “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” I find some comfort in these words.\\xa0 What I did then was survive. It was all I knew how to do. I certainly “know better” now, but it is ultimately the “do better” that matters. Perhaps the act of “doing better” is where compassion and forgiveness lie.\\xa0 Doing better is accepting responsibility for my actions and apologizing to those I hurt. I am truly sorry for the pain I caused, the scars I created and the trauma I inflicted. I know what I did was wrong — terribly wrong — and in no way am I asking for absolution. The idea of reaching out and trying to locate some of my victims and apologizing directly weighs heavy. I want to, but I am afraid. I do not want to reopen any of their old wounds, but perhaps I am simply not yet ready to face the cold, hard consequences of my actions. Doing better means telling this story and starting a conversation. It is not easy to admit to these things in such a public forum. I both expect and accept the criticism that will come my way. A logical response to what I have done is anger and judgement. But past that, on the other side of that, I hope there is reflection and an openness to dialogue. We can only begin to effect change if we are willing to speak our truths, admit when we are wrong and start to listen to each other.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3984575f-4e86-4d29-8adb-523728033507', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/090421/focus-on-vaccine-festival-from-april-11-14-modi-to-cms.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"On a day India recorded\\xa0about\\xa01.32\\xa0lakh fresh cases of Covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conferred with the\\xa0Chief\\xa0Ministers of several states in virtual mode to discuss the surging Covid-19 infections and the vaccine strategy.

Anything can happen at the last moment and life can change in the blink of an eye. It’s this notion that drives the story in 11th Hour, directed by Praveen Sattaru, where the CEO of an Indian conglomerate, Aratrika Reddy finds herself racing against time to save her company from going bankrupt. Adapted from Upendra Namburi’s novel, , the series has been written by Pradeep, and has Tamannaah playing the central character. From the outset, Pradeep draws parallels between Aratrika Reddy’s journey and a young girl’s journey through the woods in the fable of Red Riding Hood. There’s danger lurking everywhere, and a big bad wolf poses a huge threat to the young girl’s life. In Aratrika’s life, there are multiple people who want to say her downfall, including her own father who can’t stand her. The world of is filled with fascinating people. There are three different investors and competitors, backed by foreign companies, who are baying for blood and the chairman of a bank who has a personal vendetta against Aratrika’s company. She has to repay Rs 10,000 crores to the bank and all doors seem shut. She has about eight hours to pull off this impossible task. The rest of the story is about how Aratrika manages to survive at the 11th hour. The entire story unfolds in a hotel, which is turned into a battleground for the long night. Aratrika’s competitors entice her with lucrative offers to save her company; however, the catch is that her dream of producing clean energy will be taken away from her. She resists every offer hoping that a miracle occurs somehow. The stakes keep rising and the pressure is intense. captures all this drama and action, and the premise itself is quite interesting. But then, there’s a big catch with the series. The race against time doesn’t quite translate to the screen. You understand the motivations of the characters and why they want to snatch away the company from Aratrika, but the storytelling isn’t engaging enough. In short, the story is tense, but the drama isn’t. Multiple flashbacks are shown to establish characters and backstories, which have led to the crisis which Aratrika is facing, but on the downside, all this takes the focus away from what’s happening in the present. And somewhere, you can’t help but feel that the characters are repressing themselves because they have to be dignified. This takes the edge away from the proceedings, and even when the stakes are high, it doesn’t strike you hard enough to root for Aratrika. On the other hand, Tamannaah finds herself in an interesting role which is refreshing. She comes across as a cold-blooded person, but behind this veneer, is extremely emotional and will do anything to save her company. Tamannaah juggles between these two personas quite well, and she shines throughout the series. Shatru and Adit make a solid impression in their respective roles, and the rest of the cast including Jayaprakash too does justice to their roles. The production design, cinematography, and music are impressive throughout the story. has scale, grandeur, and a solid premise which is quite different from what we’ve seen in recent times. But it doesn’t quite hook you in a manner that you expect after you understand what’s at stake.

Even the day before, he sounded hopeful because he had heard that the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney\\xa0 .\\xa0 Brandon read his speech to the Pardon Office to me before presenting it, and the profound level of remorse he expressed brought me to tears. He was a different person from the teenager arrested over 20 years earlier. Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed. I began writing to death row prisoners after reading Bryan Stevenson’s book \\xa0about an innocent man condemned to death row.\\xa0Books often change my course; I read \\xa0a few years ago and haven’t eaten meat since. After reading “Just Mercy,” I sent out postcards to about a dozen death row inmates across the U.S. When I started what my husband, family and friends universally consider an odd hobby, I had no idea how gratifying and life-altering writing death row prisoners would become.\\xa0\\xa0 When we first began exchanging letters a year ago, I warned Brandon that I had one other pen pal at Terre Haute federal penitentiary. In my experience, inmates do not want to write someone with multiple pen pals at the same facility out of legitimate concerns over privacy and safety. Brandon’s immediate response was, “Well, then that makes me one of the two luckiest men at Terre Haute.” To call himself lucky after over 23 hours a day in a six-by-eight-foot cell was the first of many lessons in gratitude Brandon taught me. Brandon was 18 when he took part in a robbery gone wrong. He had no prior history of violence. Brandon’s friends carjacked a white couple, Todd and Stacey Bagley, youth ministers innocently offering a ride to kids purportedly in need. Later,\\xa0Brandon rejoined the group only to see Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the crime, fatally shoot Todd and Stacey in the head at close range. The man who had just shot two people in the head and still had a gun in his hand then ordered Brandon and three other teens to set the car on fire with the couple’s bodies inside. \\xa0 At trial, , meaning he offered the jury no alternative perspective on the charges.\\xa0Brandon was the only accomplice not given an opportunity to plead guilty.\\xa0The other accomplices pleaded out and received prison sentences; two are home with their families now.\\xa0 Brandon was falsely portrayed as a hardened high-level gang member.

Brandon never got the chance to clarify his case in court — it remained the story poorly told at trial two decades earlier.

He was 40 when he died.\\xa0 Brandon loved his life, even in its limited capacity on death row. \\xa0in his decades behind bars.\\xa0This is no small feat given that death row is like a prison within a prison, with countless oppressive rules and ensuing frustrations.\\xa0 Brandon mainly spent his time mentoring at-risk youth, reading, crocheting and playing the guitar. Brandon was calmer and more patient than most people I’ve come across; he spoke slowly and thoughtfully and was an avid listener. He never cursed and when I asked if that was for religious reasons, he said, “No, cursing just feels too aggressive to me.” A few days before his execution, Brandon’s family visited him for the last time.\\xa0 After the visit, Brandon told me there was a hole in the pane of glass. I naively said, “Oh, so you were able to hold hands.” He explained it was an air hole to speak through, not large enough for hands, “But,” he said, “I could smell my mom.” In 20 years, including in his final days, Brandon was never allowed to physically touch a loved one. Never having physical contact is an inhumane daily assault on the soul.

They spread slowly across the screen — a brush-stroke here, another there. At first there is no telling what they will add up to, but soon there are enough of them to form a larger picture: the skyline of a city, or a ramshackle section of a city. More specific images now crowd the frame: a busy road, people walking, vehicles zipping by, movie hoardings. A setting has been established, a narrative begun. Gitanjali Rao’s animated film opens with this movement from haziness to clarity; with nebulous blocks used to construct something sharp and defined. A little later, similar blurry boxes of colour will resolve themselves into a small marketplace where we are introduced to two of the film’s protagonists — a flower-seller named Kamala and her school-going sister Tara. These opening scenes depict one version — or one specific experience — of Bombay, and others will soon follow: this is a set of interlinking stories about people from different backgrounds and religions, facing various demons and various types of loneliness. For each of them, “Bombay” is as much a state of mind as a place — the city is of course a bustling physical entity, but it is also a fluid one, constantly shaped and reshaped in the characters’ imaginations. Kamala fantasises about being a princess in a genteel bygone era (and is brought back to rude reality by a who wants to send her to Dubai). Her boyfriend Salim is nourished by the escapist dreams of Bombay’s cinema — and its heroes who can make the impossible possible — but also haunted by memories of the Kashmir he was forced to flee when his parents were gunned down. And, in some of the film’s most elegiac passages, when Shirley D’Souza — an old actress who worked in the 1950s — walks through her nook of the city, colour yields to black and white and the landscape she passes transforms into what it once was…what it still is in her mind’s eye. This depiction of the past moving alongside the present is one of the most striking things about . Old songs like “ ” fleetingly grace the soundtrack. A reflection of Shirley in a mirror shows a younger version of her. Ghosts dance in a graveyard. The sleeve of a shirt — draped across a chair as a stand-in for a long-dead lover — appears to move as if in response to a remark (before one realises that a cat had brushed against it). A weary clock-maker — seemingly a relic of a bygone world, no longer “relevant” — comes alive when presented with a task that only someone like him can do; he asks for his tools — “ ! !” — like a surgeon focused on his work. While this is a Bombay film, and is about the many possibilities of that city, one can also argue that it isn’t about any one place: it is about people and the things they carry inside them, from memories of the past to projections of an imagined future. Watching it, I was strangely reminded of the 2015 Malayalam film , even though there isn’t much surface similarity between these two works or their settings. , intelligently adapted from a Chekhov short story, begins with ethereal images of the Kuttanad backwaters where a child — soon to be sent away from the only home he knows — spends much of his time minding ducks with his grandfather, their boat rowing across a breath-taking network of canals. To a viewer who is more interested in the quick movement of plot than in the establishing of mood, these scenes might feel self-indulgent or pretentious or slow — but as the film progresses, their importance will become clear. These images are essential markers of a childhood that is about to end: they show how much this boy is part of his setting, and what he is going to be separated from. They are also sights that he desperately needs to preserve in his mind — how fitting it is, then, that the film does everything it can to make these images unforgettable. A decade and a half ago, when it seemed likely for a while that I would have to shift out of the south Delhi neighbourhood I had lived in since age 10, a sudden burst of nostalgia crept up on me and I wandered the length of the colony for an afternoon, camera in hand — taking photos of the many little sights and landmarks, however unremarkable and non-photogenic, that I thought I was going to lose. A few moments in reminded me of that rush to collect images. Similarly, watching Shirley D’Souza and Tara on their walks in , I thought about the ways in which my neighbourhood has changed over the decades, through a gradual accumulation of events: how a leafy park where we used to play cricket as children turned into an overcrowded parking space where residents scowl at each other while manoeuvring their cars; how a large mall complex sprang up in what was once vast barren land occupied only by a dying old tree; how a video-cassette parlour morphed into a DVD store and then disappeared altogether, and a single-screen hall became a shining multiplex. And about how one’s sense of self also changes along with these things, so that you might find yourself — during a walk through the colony — alternating between being a child and an adult with just a small shift in perspective, or in a change in the play of light as you glance at something. What these two films have in common is how they create a sense of a setting as something inseparable from the inner lives of the protagonists. They are plaintive depictions of how places define us and are defined by us. For both the old actress in and the little boy in , there will be no going back to their secure spaces — except in the world of the imagination.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='96d3fa14-2ead-4fde-b48d-634749243675', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/companies/230321/adani-ports-to-acquire-controlling-stake-in-gangavaram-port-for-rs-36.html', 'title': 'Adani Ports to acquire controlling stake in Gangavaram Port for Rs 3,604 cr', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 1:21 pm IST', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone on Tuesday said it will acquire controlling interest in Gangavaram Port Ltd (GPL) from DVS Raju and family for Rs 3,604 crore taking its stake in GPL to 89.6 per cent.

The ruling TMC has embraced it as its main poll plank to counter the rise of the BJP\\'s Hindutva narrative in the state. \\xa0 It has branded BJP as a \"party of outsiders\" and has fanned the \\'Bengali pride\\' by coming up with a poll slogan \"Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chai\" (Bengal wants its own daughter) creating a poll narrative of sub-nationalism to counter the saffron party\\'s identity politics. The electoral discourse in Bengal, where poll battles are fought on ideological lines, had in the past mostly steered clear of sub-nationalism like identity politics. \"This is for the first time we have made Bengali pride our main poll plank. Bengali pride is not just about Bengalis; it appeals to all sons of the soil,\" senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy told PTI. \\xa0 Another senior TMC leader said \"divisive politics and religious polarisation can be countered with sub-nationalism and regionalism.\" BJP has blamed Trinamool Congress for bringing up the issue of Bengali pride saying it is harping on nationalism, development and identity politics as it senses defeat in its citadel. \"BJP is in power in so many states, but we have never tried to impose any language or culture. This is a baseless allegation as TMC has nothing to showcase to seek votes,\" BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said. \\xa0 BJP national president J P Nadda claimed at various poll rallies that only BJP can restore the Bengali pride and that \"TMC represents everything that is opposite to it\". To counter the narrative and project itself as a party in sync with Bengali culture and ethos, BJP has propped up Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee as its icon. It has also been observing the anniversaries of Bengali icons Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Parties cutting across political lines feel that the issue has its pitfalls and will have a cascading effect on the federal structure in the days to come. \\xa0 They agree that sub-nationalism can no longer be ignored in Bengal as it is reflective of the state\\'s socio- political history which has always preferred opposing or challenging the party at the Centre or a bigger political force and have refused submission. Born out of the Congress on January 1, 1998, TMC had adopted the evocative slogan \\'Maa Mati Manush\\' (Mother, Land and People) carefully blending socialism and secularism that countered the then communists and their doctrines. The rise of BJP in Bengal\\'s political map made TMC realise that its socialist slogan was not enough to offset \\'Hindutva\\', especially when it has been branded by the saffron camp as a party that favours only minorities. \\xa0 It then came up with the narrative of Bengali pride and insider versus outsider debate and has it as its main poll and ideological planks. The desecration of the bust of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar during a BJP procession in the last phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, followed by the publication of the final NRC list in Assam in August that year gave TMC a golden opportunity to brand BJP as an \"anti-Bengali\" party. The NRC list had left out the names of 19 lakh people in Assam, many of them Bengalis. The state BJP\\'s over-dependence on the party\\'s central leadership with leaders from other states calling the shots have not helped matters for the saffron party. It has in fact further fuelled the \"insider versus outsider\" debate. \\xa0 BJP national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya feels that TMC is only interested in winning the votes and has nothing to do with Bengali pride. \"These are gimmicks to win the election. Everybody knows how concerned TMC is about Bengalis and their welfare,\" he said. To woo the Bengali voters, the saffron party in its poll manifesto promised Tagore Smriti Puraskar on the lines of the Nobel prize to honour globally recognised talents and the Satyajit Ray Award on the lines of the Oscar award. It also promised a Gurudev Centre for Cultural Excellence and a film city was promised named after matinee idol Uttam Kumar. \\xa0 TMC has blamed the ascent of BJP in Bengal\\'s political sphere and the increased activities of far-right Hindu outfits which are more in sync with north Indian culture for the politicisation of ethnic sentiments in the state. But a quick look at post-Idependence Bengal\\'s socio- political history shows how Bengali sub-nationalism has always played a role before going dormant in the past few decades. The effect of sub-nationalism in the state was first felt when Congress led by the then chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy in the mid-fifties lost the election to nine municipalities and an assembly by-poll on the issue of merger of West Bengal and Bihar. \\xa0 The Left Front and Praja Socialist Party had then opposed it tooth and nail stating that Bengalis would beome a minority post the merger. Till the mid \\'90S the issue of Bengali pride was not overtly brought into play, as both the mainstream political parties - the Congress ande CPI(M) had several homegrown stalwarts. There were leaders like Jyoti Basu, Bhupesh Gupta, Indrajit Gupta from the Left and Siddartha Sankar Ray, Pranab Mukherjee, A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury from the Congress. However, the CPI(M), which over the years has moulded itself as a party of the Bengali bhadralok (gentleman) through its anti-Congress and anti-Centre stance, smacked of subtle sub-nationalism by often citing \\'Centre\\'s oppression against Bengal\\'. \\xa0 Noted Historian Sugata Bose contends that sub- nationalism was always in the play in Bengal politics in a covert manner. \"The issue of Bengali sub-nationalism was there in post-Independence Bengal, though in a very subtle way. It was never a major rallying point. The Left\\'s constant attack on the Centre and Congress alleging step-motherly treatment towards Bengal was aimed in that direction. \"But after the formation of TMC in 1998, Bengali sub-nationalism was never an issue as the party and the Bengal CPI-M which it defeated were regional players,\" Bose, the Gardiner Professor of Oceanic history at Harvard University, told PTI. \\xa0 \"It is now back as a major poll issue as TMC, a regional party is fighting against BJP, a national party. It has gained momentum as BJP does not have strong homegrown leaders in Bengal and is overdependent on central leaders,\" he said. Several outfits like Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha have emerged in the state\\'s political landscape and they have accused the saffron camp of trying to \"impose Hindi and north Indian culture\" on Bengal. \"The way Bengalis are demographically threatened by non-Bengalis, the day is not far when they will turn into a minority in their own land. This will not only be just in terms of population but also culturally. We are happy that Bengali sub-nationalism has emerged as a rallying point in this polls,\" Kaushik Maiti, a senior leader of Bangla Pokkho, told PTI. \\xa0 These outfits have been raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state. The narrative has its drawbacks as it alienates the Hindi-speaking population, who are a deciding factor in at least 30 of the state\\'s 294 Assembly seats. Sensing this, the TMC has tied up with the RJD and Samajwadi Party for the assembly polls. The two parties have offered unconditional support to it and will campaign for TMC in the Hindi-speaking belts of the state. Political analyst Suman Bhattacharya feels that Bengali sub-nationalism will play an important role in the assembly poll and will be a deciding factor in several seats. \\xa0 \"It had never played such a major role in the polls. But Bengali pride and sub-nationalism will play a pivotal role this election and a decisive role in several seats,\" he said.

All-rounder Marcus Stoinis was dropped on 30 by Yuzvendra Chahal, after which he went on to score a 26-ball 53 and power the Capitals to 196 for four at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Monday. Kohli himself had dropped KL Rahul twice in RCB’s loss to Kings XI Punjab earlier in the tournament. “Those important chances in between, we need to grab when the opportunity comes our way. It is not like we are dropping half chances, we are dropping sitters and those things hurt you,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony. “We got into the game after the first six and then Stoinis batted really well in the end, we gave him a life, he took the game away from us,” he added. Delhi were off to a flying start with openers Prithvi Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan adding 68 runs. The RCB bowlers were able to pull things back, picking up quick wickets before slipping again. “I think they got off to a great start in the first six then we pulled it back in the next eight overs and the last phase again got away from us,” Kohli said. RCB have won three of their five matches. However, both their losses have come while chasing big targets. “I think it is about rectifying those small mistakes. The conversation around chasing is always to have a big partnership, with the dew setting in had we kept 7-8 wickets at the end of 10 overs, the game would have been on,” Kohli said. Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer was delighted with his team’s all-round performance. “Our strategy was to be fearless and play with full freedom. We have got good youngsters in our side, so we just need to go out and execute our talent and skills. I am very happy with the way things are going so far, and we need to keep up the momentum,” Iyer said. “It is important for us to get a good recovery. It isn’t easy going back into the bio bubble, so we try to spend time with each other and that is working really well for us,” he added. Axer Patel (2/18), who came in to the side in place of the injured Amit Mishra, played a vital role in his side’s victory and was adjudged the Man of the Match. “I knew it was stopping on the wicket. I knew I would bowl in the Powerplay and I had practised for it as well. I executed my plans really well. “My plan after speaking to batsmen was that since the wicket was slow, I wanted to bowl at the stumps and vary the pace. “In the Powerplay I was in a mood to defend at first, but when the third ball spun I changed gears and got into an attack mode,” he said.

After a nail-biting election day that extended by nearly a week, Democrat Joe Biden finally won the mantle of the 46th president of the United States of America on Saturday, 7 November, after a victory in Pennsylvania. Soon after the victory, Biden took to Twitter to say, “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country”. The Biden Campaign also released a statement from the president-elect on Saturday, in which he said, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.” Several US networks projected Biden as having won the presidential race after securing the key battleground of Pennsylvania, which helped him cross the 270 votes needed to win. With 20 electoral votes from the state, Biden now has a total of 273 electoral votes. He ran for president in 1988 but withdrew after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British leader Neil Kinnock.

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming . BHG Holdings also reported a 40\\xa0to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened\\xa0operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods,\\xa0to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours. \\xa0 The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners.\\xa0Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made\\xa0business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.\\xa0 From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020. It stands at 10 per cent now.\\xa0 Property tax rebates passed on by property owners have dried up. Although retail rent is\\xa0expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail\\xa0balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.\\xa0 Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use\\xa0real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return\\xa0to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as\\xa0Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm. Perhaps it also\\xa0knows not keeping up risks losing loyal customers to competing malls.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='ad04faf9-08f2-4192-b8a4-52241d76b49c', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/maharashtra-opens-places-of-religious-worship/', 'title': 'Maharashtra opens places of religious worship', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Maharashtra, which were shut since the imposition of COVID-19 lockdown in March, reopened on Monday with devotees visiting some of the prominent temples and shrines in the state.

The opposition BJP in the state had been seeking reopening of the places of worship and earlier questioned the Thackeray governments decision to not reopen temples at a time when bars were allowed to reopen. The chief minister, however, had defended his decision saying it was difficult to follow physical distancing at the places of worship. The issue had also led to a stand-off between Thackeray and state Governor B S Koshyari, who reminded the Shiv Sena president of his Hindutva credentials and asked if he had turned secular. Koshyari’s letter to the chief minister was criticised by constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Thackeray had said that after places of worship are reopened, rules and safety protocols have to be followed strictly, and laid stress on wearing masks. “If we follow discipline, we will get God’s blessings,” Thackeray had said.

Among other guidelines, common prayer mats should be avoided and devotees should bring their own prayer mats or pieces of cloth, which they can take back with them. Physical offering of ‘prasad’, distribution or sprinkling of holy water is not allowed. Floors at places of worship should be cleaned multiple times in a day, and community kitchens and ‘langars’ should follow physical distancing, the guidelines said.

The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to prepare for the launch of such workplace vaccination. According to news agency , Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries said a substantial proportion of the population aged 45 years and above is in the organised sector of the economy and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private) or manufacturing and services. \"In order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations, vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing COVID vaccination centre,\" Bhushan said in the letter . He said the states can initiate due consultations with private/public sector employers and management to prepare for launch of workplace vaccination. \"Such workplace vaccination centres may be launched across states/Union Territories from 11 April, 2021,\" he said. The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to make adequate preparations and issued guidelines in this regard. According to the government\\'s guidance note, workplace vaccination sessions may be organised to facilitate optimal utilization of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage. \"Organizing vaccination at the workplace will not only be convenient to the staff at workplaces but also help to avoid travel and hence reducing the risk of exposure to virus,\" it said. According to the guidelines, only employees aged 45 years or more will be eligible for vaccination at workplaces and no outsiders including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination. One of the senior staff of the organisation will be assigned to work as nodal officer to coordinate with district health authorities/ private COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) and support vaccination activities. The beneficiaries will be required to register in Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination and CVC nodal officer will ensure registration of all targeted beneficiaries and facility of on-the-spot registration will also be available but only to employees of the workplace, the guidelines said. Once identified, the workplace vaccination centres will also have to register on the Co-WIN portal as government or private CVC at workplace. For optimal utilisation of resources, vaccination sessions will be planned at workplace CVC once at least 50 beneficiaries get registered for vaccination. \"The schedule of vaccination sessions can be made up to 15 days in advance and intimated to the workplaces so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of vaccination. In most of the workplaces vaccination schedules may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,\" the Centre told states and union territories in the guidelines. The District Task Force chaired by district magistrate and Urban Task Force chaired by municipal commissioner will identify such government and private workplaces after due deliberations with relevant employers. Every CVC in a government workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the government medical facility while every CVC in a private workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the private medical facility. The designated government and private CVC to whom the workplace CVC has been tagged will be responsible for the deployment of the vaccination team at workplace CVCs. All government and private CVCs are already linked to some cold chain points for receiving vaccines. \"These CVCs will continue to use the same mechanism to receive the vaccine needed for vaccination at tagged workplace CVC,\" the guidelines said. \"Some of the work places may have health infrastructure in form of hospitals, health clinics, nursing centers, etc. This infrastructure may be utilized to set-up vaccination site in case sufficient space for waiting, vaccination and observation rooms are available,\" the guidelines stated. The healthcare workers of this health infrastructure of the workplace CVCs (such as doctors, nurses and other staff) may be deployed for the vaccination activities at workplaces as vaccination team members, it said. The workplace CVCs staff engaged in vaccination activities will follow the same SOPs for vaccination and reporting including management and reporting of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The government has also spelled out the requirements for AEFI management at the workplace CVCs. In order to\\xa0avoid mixing of vaccine types in first and second dose, only one type of vaccine will be provided at such sessions that are conducted at the workplaces.

Ramachandran is addressed as \\'Puratchi Thalaivar,\\' meaning revolutionary leader. \\xa0 Jayakumar even sprang a surprise recently by playing kabaddi with the youth on his way home after winding up the day\\'s hectic election campaign. His unparalleled popularity is something that cannot be underestimated, but rival DMK insists a change is required. \"It is time for change, the time for the Rising Sun (DMK symbol) under the leadership M K Stalin to emerge,\" has been the constant refrain of the party\\'s 54-year old candidate R Murthy\\'s election campaign. He is the proprietor of iDream Cinemas and iDream properties. \\xa0 But Jayakumar, contesting for the seventh time from his home turf, is confident of emerging victorious this time too. Despite its mixed bag of communities, traffic woes of residents of Royapuram assembly constituency have not ended. Fishermen, who play a major role in tilting the scales, are apprehensive of the multi-crore developmental programmes in the coastal villages as these threaten their livelihood opportunities. \"DMK\\'s assurance for a sea bridge project connecting Chennai Port-Thiruvottriyur to eliminate traffic congestion and fasten commercial access to and out of the port is not needed. This will only corrode the livelihood opportunities of the fisher folk,\" says Bharathi Ku, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association (SIFWA). \\xa0 \"What we need is livelihood protection initiatives, not multi-crore projects that eat into our villages,\" he argues. The fishermen are also opposed to establishing desalination plants in the coastal villages. \"The ever increasing population and floating population of at least 50,000 people on an average per day into Royapuram for trading and other activities makes this constituency prone to frequent traffic snarls,besides taxing existing resources,\" 60-year old Jayakumar, who hails from the fishing community, told P T I. \\xa0 Despite being a small area, the density of population is high and streets are narrow in Royapuram. Not less than 3,500 autos make sorties into Royapuram on any given day, Jayakumar, who is also an advocate, claims. \"So this calls for implementing a master plan to meet the increasing requirements of the people. Though the second phase of the Metro rail project will sharply dissuade the dependency on two-wheelers and other vehicles,I will appoint a consultant to transform this constituency into a model one, he said. Already due to his efforts, problems of water stagnation and power cuts have been resolved and slum clusters replaced with multi-storied apartments to accommodate the poor, he said, adding that improving the amenities in Mint is next in the agenda. \\xa0 Murthy, on the other hand, assures to upgrade the century-old RSRM Maternity Hospital on par with the AIIMS. \"Also, the constituency needs an arts college,\" he said. Apart from building a huge library,the DMK candidate said he will establish six community halls with parking facilities, a modern auditorium, a library for each division and a multi-level parking facility in the constituency, if he wins. \"We still face the problems of drinking water and inadequate drainage facility. In certain areas, sewage water mingles with drinking water.

The party’s bond with corporate America, however, is fraying. Fissures have burst open over the GOP’s embrace of conspiracy theories and rejection of mainstream climate science, as well as its dismissal of the 2020 election outcome. The most recent flashpoint was in Georgia, where a new Republican-backed law restricting voting rights\\xa0 \\xa0from Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, whose headquarters are in the state, and resulted in Major League Baseball pulling the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta. Republicans were furious. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned that their actions were\\xa0 \\xa0GOP strategists argued that they no longer needed corporate America’s money to win elections as they try to rebrand as a party of blue-collar workers. That extends an opportunity to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats to find an ally in an unlikely place when the party has unified control of the federal government for the first time in a decade. Biden is pushing an ambitious $2.3 trillion infrastructure package that includes corporate tax increases — which the White House is characterizing to CEOs as upfront investments that will ultimately make companies more profitable. “It’s important for making the country more competitive,” said Cedric Richmond, the White House’s director of public engagement. “We think the plan is so important to the country that we are advocating and singing its praises to all businesses.” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo estimates she has talked to more than 50 business leaders about the plan, including a round of Easter weekend phone calls. She is encouraging companies to focus on the entire package instead of the tax increases. “You can’t look at one piece of it and say that one number makes you walk away,” she said. “They say, ‘That’s fair. Let me think about it.’ That’s how they run their businesses.” Whether the corporate split with the GOP widens could help answer questions about the political direction of the country and the extent to which business can continue to influence Washington. “Nobody in the business community wants hostile communities, angry finger-pointing workforces and turbulent shareholder bases,” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management. “It makes your job so much harder to have every constituency group at war within themselves, which has become the hallmark of the GOP.” Corporate America’s marriage with Republicans has long been one of convenience, united by a belief in low taxes and the need to repeal regulations. But the relationship, already strained during Donald Trump’s presidency, has come under increasing pressure as companies take cultural stands. That Republicans and businesses report to increasingly distinct constituencies helps explain the tension. A solid majority of Republican voters are white (86%) and older than 50 (62%), according to APVoteCast, a national survey of the 2020 electorate. Yet figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that workers are more racially diverse and younger than the Republican base. James Bailey, a management professor at George Washington University, published an analysis last year that suggested people who identified as Democrats cared more about a company’s political activity than Republicans do. Of business people, he said the uproar over the Georgia voting law “is a great opportunity for them to get on board with the young socially active consumer and to do so without much cost.” Just as important, Democratic counties have become the primary engines for growth. The counties that backed Biden last year account for 71% of all U.S. economic activity, according to the Brookings Institution. Democrats say business are comfortable partnering with them to address longstanding issues such as infrastructure after a decade of congressional gridlock, even though companies dislike the possibility of footing the bill. “Responsible corporate leaders want economic growth and predictable, competent policy— that’s what Democrats are offering.” said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who is running the House Democrats’ campaign arm for the 2022 midterm elections. Many Republicans are exasperated by business’s efforts to woo consumers through liberal social politics. “They are never going to satisfy the demands of the left,” said Steven Law, a former attorney for the Chamber who now runs Senate Leadership Fund, a big-spending outside group aligned with McConnell. Meantime “they risk alienating their natural allies in the Republican Party.” Still, Republicans have been a major driver of the rift, looking to capitalize on the culture clash to turn out the party base in the next election. Early indicators suggest business could face blowback. Georgia’s Republican-controlled House voted to strip Delta of a tax break worth tens of millions of dollars annually for its criticism of the new restrictive law, which voting rights groups have excoriated as an attack on democracy. The intended punishment was rendered moot after the GOP Senate failed to take it up before the legislative session adjourned. Campaign finance disclosures suggest corporate America’s money doesn’t buy as much influence as it once did. Roughly a decade ago, donations from company-sponsored political action committees accounted for an important share of the fundraising pie. But it’s stagnated as a source of campaign cash, as court rulings enabled wealthy GOP activists to pour money into the political system. Just 10 GOP megadonors account for half of the giving to major super political action committees controlled by Republican congressional leaders since 2012, collectively pouring $541 million into the committees, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of donors who gave over $1,000. The megadonors also contributed twice as much as conventional PACs and other groups that represent a broad swath of corporate interests. Political spending by the Chamber has also dropped precipitously. After spending $29 million in 2016, mostly supporting Republicans and attacking Democrats, the group’s contributions dropped to $10.9 million in 2018, according to data from nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. In 2020,\\xa0 , which Republicans saw as a betrayal. That’s diminished the group’s once unassailable standing with GOP congressional leaders. “There is absolutely no love lost for corporations, especially when they consistently weigh in on things they don’t understand,” said Josh Holmes, a political adviser to McConnell. “There’s no sympathy.” Common ground still exists between Republicans and business on the value of tax cuts. The Chamber and the Business Roundtable oppose raising the corporate rate to 28% from the 21% level set in 2017, as well as an enhanced global minimum tax. Yet both groups want government spending on infrastructure. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s chief policy officer, said the broader business community isn’t fully aligned with either party. But the hyperpartisan nature of today’s politics is creating pressure to choose one side. “It really causes people to want to sort everything into a red camp or a blue camp,” he said. “Businesses aren’t partisan. They aren’t Republicans or Democrats. They have to operate and function in divided governments, operate in states that are solid blue and solid red.” Republicans caution, however, that business faces considerable risk weighing in on hot-button disputes. “They ought to tread carefully because they risk getting into the middle of a culture war that will earn them no friends and a lot of enemies,” said Law, the McConnell ally.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='0c4b07d4-094c-4f80-bf1a-d205485c01a4', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.thehindu.com', 'section': 'News', 'sub_section': 'Cities News', 'article_url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/citys-private-lab-delaying-covid-19-test-results/article34298288.ece', 'title': '‘City’s private lab delaying COVID-19 test results’', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='NEW DELHI , 11/04/2021: Covid 19 vaccination in progress at a dispensary in New Delhi on Sunday, April 11 to 14th is also being observed at Tika Utsav, even as covid-19 vaccine in Delhi on April 11 as the Tika Utsav or vaccine festival has begun across the country.

Its UK counterpart, however, said it would offer people under 30 the choice of another product. The European Medicines Agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. It said most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination — but based on the currently available evidence, it was not able to identify specific risk factors. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the United Kingdom, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. “The reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine,” said Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director. But it placed no new age restrictions on using the vaccine in people 18 and over, as some countries have done. “The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects.,” Cooke said. Dr. June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, echoed that sentiment, saying that the benefits “continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.” She called the unusual clots a “potential side effect” of the vaccine and said the evidence was “firming up,” but more study was needed to be sure. The EMA, the World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots. The announcements could have far-reaching effects on the use of the shot that is key to global efforts to end the pandemic. The EMA's investigation was particularly focused on two types of rare blood clots: one that appears in multiple blood vessels and another that occurs in a vein that drains blood from the brain. It also evaluated reports of people who had low levels of blood platelets, which puts them at risk of severe bleeding. As recently as last week, the EMA said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population” — a response to several countries doing just that — though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected. In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine. Meanwhile, Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, never suspended use of the vaccine. The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic. Dr Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine globally could have serious consequences. “We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said. That’s because the vaccine is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries. It has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine. The governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region had said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot. “If they do like Germany, and allow Astra Zeneca only to people over 65, that would be absurd. Before it was only for people under 55. Put yourself in the place of citizens, it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters on Wednesday. The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary. “If there are in fact individuals of a certain age group that could have a higher risk (of clotting) then we need to adjust its use,” Casado told Spanish public radio. “We are not questioning AstraZeneca. We need all the vaccines possible to reach the goal of 70% of the adult population.” French health authorities said they, too, were awaiting EMA’s conclusions and would follow the agency’s recommendations, especially for the 500,000 people who have received the first dose of AstraZeneca. Even officials in Asia said they were keen to hear the EMA's decision. On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said it would also pause a vaccine rollout to school nurses and teachers that was to begin on Thursday while awaiting the outcome of the EMA’s review. English, the former chair of a British Medical Association committee, said that even rare, serious side effects are seen with established vaccines and that policymakers often decide that bigger public health goals warrant their use, citing the polio vaccine as an example. For every million doses that are given of the oral polio vaccine, about one child is paralyzed from the live virus contained in the vaccine. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which developed the vaccine, paused a study of the shot in children while the U.K. regulator evaluates the link between the shot and rare blood clots in adults.\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='39a8a2f2-4f9b-42d9-8d71-3ce8f6579ef9', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/four-suspected-terrorists-killed-in-an-encounter-in-jk/', 'title': 'Four suspected terrorists killed in an encounter in J&K', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Four suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were killed in an encounter with security forces on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway on the outskirts of Jammu city early on Thursday, officials said.

Their stupendous performance in last year’s IPL earned them a ticket to Team India. Their inclusion has once accentuated the significance of playing well in the IPL. But unfortunately, the competition was so intense that neither of them could find a place in the playing X1 in the ODI team. Krunal Pandya replaced Suryakumar Yadav for the ODIs; in fact, the latter made his ODI debut against England last Tuesday and scored a record 26-ball 50. \\r\\nSimilarly, despite some good performances, K.L. Rahul is facing stiff competition from Rishab Pant as a wicket-keeping batsman. \\xa0 And with the next edition of IPL set to happen next month, more new faces are likely to emerge, putting existing performers in trouble. Ishan and Suryakumar were among the 12 batsmen who scored 350-plus runs in last year’s IPL. Naturally, they were drafted into the National side for the recent T-20 series against England. Cricket administrator and former Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) for Kolkata Knight Riders Makarand Waingankar agrees that IPL has helped many cricketers to play for Team India. He adds that the format has given the players a great opportunity to play against international cricketers much before they make their international debut. \\xa0 “Youngsters have become fearless because of their IPL stints. The situation is so dynamic that it has become challenging for players to retain their spots in the team,” points out Makarand, and adds that sometimes even top performers have to be dropped because of the competition. “Team India won matches in Australia even without Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, etc. But now if they come back, where do you slot them?” he asks. While former greats like Sachin Tendulkar, M.S. Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, etc., had the luxury of playing the game almost till their 40s, the situation for the current crop looks grim. At a time where even performers are being left out due to high competition, cricketers’ longevity on the field is in jeopardy. \\xa0 Sports analyst and historian Sunil Yashkalra describes the current situation as a ‘problem of plenty’. Commenting that league tournaments are the germination points of talent, he feels having a long stint like Dhoni, Sachin and Yuvraj could be difficult these days. “Today, longevity depends on not just skill but on temperament and fitness,” shares Sunil. He feels intense fitness will be the key differentiator for longevity in the game. “Vihari has done so well, but just one injury, and he is out of the team. And with the IPL taking place next month, the competition is even more intense, it makes things even tougher. Hence it is significant that a player stays injury-free,” he stresses. \\xa0 Former Indian cricketer and former coach of the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, Lalchand Rajput, reminisces that during his tenure, fitness was never a parameter. During the ’80s there wasn’t much emphasis on fitness, but only skill, he explains, adding that today, a player first needs to be an athlete to make the cut. Observers feel that while Team India may not soon see the likes of Sachin, Sehwag and Dhoni who played for several years, the BCCI should follow a strict rotation policy, where a mandatory rest is given to players after taking part in a certain number of matches. \\xa0 Former cricketer and Chief selector M.S.K. Prasad says that before he took charge, there were only 20 players playing all three formats (Test, ODI and T-20). He had visualized developing sustainable bench strength over a period of time to nurture the team to where it is now. “Bench strength (competition) will certainly challenge senior players’ longevity.

It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other.

He also argued that Ms Banerjee has been “frustrated”, realising that she was facing defeat in the polls, which is reflected in her comments. “She should reply to the notice from the EC to her,” the Union home minister said. \\xa0 The TMC chief, however, remained defiant despite the massive pressure that is mounting on her since this was the second notice in a gap of 24 hours to her from the EC over her violations of the MCC.\\xa0 “I will keep talking against the CRPF and BSF as long as they are with the BJP.

To match the US weapon, Russia developed the \"Father of All Bombs\" which is both bigger and thermobaric, meaning it uses gas to create a huge fireball rather than a shockwave, Wired reported.

The number then started declining and as of Tuesday it was over 57,000, he said. “Though there has been a dip, it is still higher as compared to September 1. However, it should not be a reason to worry as our capacity is much higher,” the health secretary said. Elucidating further, Bhushan said on an average, 2,397 metric tonnes of medical oxygen was consumed daily from September 2 to 8, and even then 15,282 metric tonnes of oxygen was in stock at the end of the week.

The survey, conducted by market research firm YouGov, factored into the weighted impact of 10 factors including an increase in gross household income, increase or decrease in household expenses, their intent to spend this Diwali season. It found only 15 percent of the respondents with an increase in their gross household incomes. On the other hand, close to 50 percent of the respondents agreed that they are more careful with their finances today than they used to be in the past. Highlighting a strong “negative” relationship with spending intent (80.96 percent), it is this factor that is likely pulling down the overall sentiment to spend more this Diwali than last year. This survey was conducted among 2,500 respondents on YouGov India’s online panel between September 21 and 25. Further, the survey also showed that 54 percent of respondents said they were likely to spend less than last year during this Diwali, compared to 23 percent who said this in 2019. One in five (20 percent) were planning to spend the same amount as last year, while only 17 percent said they would splurge more this time. Talking about the festive shopping fervor this Diwali, YouGov India General Manager Deepa Bhatia said, “After an economic slowdown caused due to the pandemic, businesses are looking forward to the festive season for revival. Even though enthusiasm among consumers is low this year, certain categories are likely to witness demand from consumers.” She added that there also seems to be an inclination towards products that ensure autonomy and fill the gap in the absence of domestic help. “It is, therefore, important to understand the requirements of these buyers and extend offers that lift the buying sentiment.” Meanwhile, the survey stated that even as the overall buying sentiment is lower as compared to last year, people are likely to invest in categories including gadgets (22 percent), closely followed by ‘clothes’ (22 percent). Appliances (17 percent), fashion accessories (15 percent), and jewellery (12 percent) are also high on the shoppers’ priority list, it added. When it came to the mode of shopping, e-commerce is likely to see a surge with more than half (54 percent) saying they prefer to shop online this Diwali. It appeared most gadget buyers are likely to buy products online (65 per cent) than offline (18 per cent). Online also appears to be the preferred medium of shopping for other categories like fashion accessories (49 percent), beauty and make-up (48 percent), clothes (46 percent), and appliances (44 percent). However, for high-ticket items like jewelry (61 percent offline as against 16 percent online) and furniture (55 percent offline as compared with 19 percent online), people prefer in-store purchases over contactless online shopping, the survey showed. When asked what products within gadgets and electronics the respondents were likely to purchase in the next three months, smartphones emerged as the top choice for nearly half the respondents (48 per cent), followed by laptops (33 per cent), wireless earphones (28 per cent), smart televisions (25 per cent) and microwave or oven (20 per cent). Besides gadgets like smartphones and laptops, people this year also seem to be interested in home automation products such as microwaves, food processors, vacuum cleaners and dishwashers, the survey said. Traditionally, India has never been a big market for automation products but the prolonged impact of the coronavirus pandemic could be driving the demand for these products, it added.

The overt campiness and winking theatricality of Schumacher’s and have long been a point of polarisation among fans of comic book movies, particularly as a darker aesthetic, first established by Tim Burton, and then cemented on movie screens by Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder, has come to define the character. But Schumacher’s approach may well have saved the franchise. (And then, two years later, nearly sunk it.) Schumacher seemed, to some, like an unlikely candidate to take the Bat-baton (Baton?) from Burton. But throughout his career, there was rarely a specific idea of a “Joel Schumacher film”; he was closer to the filmmakers of the classic studio system, a journeyman who could take on just about any assignment he was tossed, deliver it on time and on budget, and generate a profit. So he dabbled in rowdy comedy ( ), touchy-feely dramedy ( ), romantic comedy ( ), horror ( ), and sci-fi ( ). Warner Bros handed him based on the success of his adaptation of John Grisham’s legal thriller . It is easy to forget how necessary that hand-off was deemed at the time. Though , Burton’s 1992 sequel to the record-breaking 1989 , was a commercial success, its grosses fell far short of its predecessor’s. And while critical reaction was mostly positive, some complained about its gloomy tone (Roger Ebert called it “odd and sad”). Plenty of parents agreed, put off by both the dark violence and the subtle, leather-heavy kinkiness of the relationship between Batman and Catwoman. The studio partnered with McDonald’s on Happy Meal tie-in for the PG-13-rated film but no one at the fast-food giant had even seen the film when it devised the campaign. A McDonald’s spokesman later told that the promotion “wasn’t intended to encourage young kids to see the movie.” In a July 1992 report in on the relative disappointment of , Steve Daly whispered, “Word is they intend to make sure that and its progeny showcase a much less dark Dark Knight — a kind of ‘Batman Lite’ — possibly without Burton at the helm.” That is exactly what happened, and that is exactly what they got. , on the other hand, opened its arms to that influence. The screenplay — credited to Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler, and Akiva Goldsman — is gleefully goofy, filled with corny one-liners and leering double entendres. Schumacher and his cinematographer, Stephen Goldblatt (nominated for an Oscar, one of the three nominations the film received), cram their Dutch-angled frames with candy-coated colors, neon lights, and billowing dry ice, while Elliot Goldenthal’s musical score takes the orchestral pomposity of Danny Elfman’s earlier themes, and cranks it up to 11. The performers similarly go for the gusto: Jim Carrey is at his most unhinged (no small achievement), Tommy Lee Jones chews scenery like it is his first meal in weeks, and Nicole Kidman vamps it up like the daughter Marlene Dietrich did not know she had. Reviews were more mixed for — critic called it, ironically enough, “the empty-calorie equivalent of a Happy Meal” — but audiences were ecstatic. It out-grossed both domestically and internationally. Warner Bros quickly signed Schumacher for another instalment. Alas, he fell into something of the same trap as Burton; taxed with reprising a mega-success, he leaned so far into his stylistic flourishes that he alienated a mass audience. has acquired a reputation as one of the worst blockbusters of all time, and it is not entirely unearned.

But there, among cathedral spires and castle parapets, the animation studio has carved out a factory of hand-drawn artistry and local folklore that has persisted and flourished well beyond its creators’ expectations. When Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, directors of the enchanting Oscar-nominee , met growing up in Kilkenny — or even after they finished college and were setting out as animators — any success seemed sure to be found in typical entertainment epicenters like London, New York or Los Angeles. Instead, they decided to stay in Kilkenny with the mission of making a single film. (It turned out to be 2009’s Oscar-nominated .) Their beginning staff of 12 worked out of an old orphanage. Twelve years later, there are nearly 400 working for Cartoon Saloon and their sister studio, Lighthouse Studios, in the heart of Kilkenny. The Lighthouse offices are housed in the secondary school Moore and Stewart once attended — a very sports-centric school, the directors recall. “Our teenage selves would be glowing with pride,” Stewart says. “Revenge of the nerds, I’ve always said,” adds Moore. Formed when much of the animation world was following Pixar into computer generated animation, Cartoon Saloon is an underdog no more. , their most ambitious film — one that completes Moore’s trilogy of Irish folklore begun with and continued with 2014′s — is expected to give Pixar’s a run for its money at the Academy Awards later this month. marks the studio’s fifth Oscar nod.

Cartoon Saloon’s next film, an adaptation of by Cartoon Saloon co-founder Nora Twomey, is for Netflix. Founded in 1999 by Moore, Twomey and producer Paul Young, Cartoon Saloon has arrived at these heights by doing everything they weren’t supposed to — making uncompromising, authentically Irish, hand-drawn animation in Moore and Stewart’s hometown. No one is more surprised than they are about how it’s all turned out. “People just told us we were mad,” says Moore, chuckling. “Once you put down even the tiniest little root in a place, it’s very hard to move,” says Stewart. “There was talk along the way to have an LA studio or even a Dublin office. Instead, it just grew and grew and grew.” is a fitting pinnacle for Cartoon Saloon because it’s set right in Kilkenny. The film, streaming on Apple TV+ and recently brought back into theatres, is about Robyn, the daughter of a British soldier in 17th-century Ireland, who comes upon a “wolfwalker” — a human who can take the form of a wolf. That, naturally, comes from mythology, but the historical backdrop of is true; this is the time of . Set between the woodcut-styled drawings of the British-controlled castle and incredibly lush, swirling forests, is — like Cartoon Saloon, itself — a tale of reclamation. “I definitely felt these three movies that I directed and co-directed were about speaking back to the next generation stuff that I was afraid was going to be completely lost,” Moore says by Zoom from Kilkenny, alongside Stewart. “I had grown up being completely immersed in Batman comics and Japanese and American cartoons and didn’t realise this was all around me.” Often, their surroundings play directly into the films. On a recent day, a stroll in Kilkenny’s Millennium Forest — planted 20 years ago with native trees — had Moore, contemplating the layers of sediment and history beneath him, musing about a possible spinoff. Increasingly, they’re finding a flock of animators from across Europe eager to follow in their footsteps, as Ireland’s answer to . For , Moore showed the storyboard artists the intensely period-appropriate horror film for inspiration. One artist got so into capturing the era that she drew constellations as they were in the 1650 sky. “When people come here, they’re taking a risk,” says Young. “They’re coming to live in your small town. You better have work for the when they get here.” With a now teeming staff, the earlier, scrappier days of Cartoon Saloon are still vivid to the founders. When their first Oscar nomination was announced, for , they were in a meeting working out how to stay financial afloat for the next two months. “We survived, but it was tough times,” recalls Young. “At the early stage, the mistake we made was thinking: If we’ve got money, we’re hiring artists. I think what we needed was a few more account-types.” Twomey, who directed the studio’s Afghanistan-set 2017 feature , disagrees. “But if we did, they would have definitely told us that there’s no money in independent film. It doesn’t make any sense. You should try to be like the big studios. And we would have lost all our freedom,” she says. “I’m glad our hearts were in the right place, and our hands were in the right place.” Stewart, art director on , a concept artist for and a painter, always believed hand-drawn animation had more potential. Unlike digital technology, it doesn’t age. In , you can often see pencil lines have deliberately been left in. Moore wanted to be even more experimental on , playing with aspect ratios and perspectives. “We kind of decided we didn’t want to do more after this. We wanted to take a break and reflect. Definitely for me, anyway,” he says. “So I said, ‘Let’s try everything that we said we were going to do and either couldn’t afford to do, didn’t know how to pull it off or were wary of.’ And I don’t think we even scratched the surface. There’s still so much more.” Stewart, a nature lover, had planned this year to reach the top of every peak in Ireland. Then came a lockdown that has since December limited everyone to within five kilometres of their home. But Cartoon Saloon has still travelled around the world like never before. There’s even a billboard for on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. “We’ve never had that kind of attention before. I’d just love to have been there to take a picture of Tomm in front of one of those big billboards,” says Twomey. “I don’t think things will be the same for us after .” It’s a dramatic change from six years ago, when Moore remembers going into a cinema in Galway and seeing posters of papered across the walls, with one of tucked away. But, still, Pixar — which takes after Silicon Valley the way Cartoon Saloon does Kilkenny — remains the Oscar favorite this year with . “Always Pixar’s way out in front, and they have a beautiful film. Damn them,” Moore laughs. “If only they could have released a lackluster film for a change.” But it’s been a time for reflection for the filmmakers on an unlikely journey that led them back home. “I thought I’d be in New York being all cool,” says Moore, shaking his head. “But here I am.” Stewart smiles. “You’re in Kilkenny being all cool.”', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='384e1c57-2ab2-454f-bae8-7053933ee6cc', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.seelatest.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.seelatest.com/marathi/vijeta-movie-review-and-rating', 'title': '', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"Vijeta may be a Marathi movie, which directed by Amol Shetge and therefore the film starring Subodh Bhave and Sushant Shelar in prominent roles.

Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored.

There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past.

India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law.

The Biden administration through the US\\xa0Trade Representative\\'s Office (USTR) faced a Sunday (Apr 11) night deadline on whether to take the rare step of reversing a US\\xa0International Trade Commission decision unless the companies had agreed a deal. An announcement of the battery makers\\' settlement is expected soon, the sources said. The agreement is a win for President Joe Biden who has made boosting electric vehicles and US\\xa0battery production a top priority. The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs, and Biden has proposed spending US$174 billion to hike EV sales and expand charging infrastructure. The accord puts an end to a bitter two-year dispute between affiliates of two of South Korea\\'s biggest conglomerates. After losing out to SK in its bid to win Volkswagen orders, LG accused SK of stealing trade secrets by poaching nearly 80 of its employees. The ITC in February sided with LG Chem after the company accused SK of misappropriating trade secrets related to EV battery technology and issued a 10-year-import ban, but it allowed SK to import components for batteries for Ford\\'s EV F-150 program for four years, and Volkswagen\\'s North American EVs for two years. SK vowed to walk away from its US$2.6 billion Georgia battery plant under construction if the ITC decision was not overturned. The ITC also faulted what it called SK\\'s \"egregious misconduct\" and SK\\'s destruction of documents ordered by company executives. Ford, VW, LG and SK declined to comment. Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh wrote in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that if the ITC decision were left in place, it could \"reduce US\\xa0battery capacity and delay the transition to electric vehicles\". LG first filed a complaint against SK in 2019 and both sides hired numerous lawyers and consultants to make their case to the Biden administration. The administration has been pushing the two companies to try to reach a settlement, as have VW and Ford, the sources said. US\\xa0Trade Representative Katherine Tai has been personally involved in the settlement discussions and urged both companies to come to a resolution, sources said. USTR declined to comment. SK in March received proposed terms from LG, including financial reparations to address LG\\'s trade secrets misappropriation claims, Reuters reported earlier citing a person familiar with the situation. Georgia is home to two newly-elected Democratic US\\xa0Senators who are a linchpin of Biden\\'s slim Congressional majority and have both spoken about the importance of ensuring the Georgia plant\\'s future. Both senators repeatedly pressed the companies to reach agreement. Warnock praised the reported deal that will ensure the Georgia plant\\'s survival, saying in a statement on Saturday that it \"will help keep the local economy moving forward\".

The musical drama is set to release on 16 April in three languages- Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu. It will open pan-India, except in Maharashtra where the government announced a weekend lockdown to curb the growing numbers of cases. \"There is pressure. This is not a formulaic film. Come with low expectations and high hopes but come to theatres with all safety precautions,\" Rahman told in a Zoom interview from Chennai. The 54-year-old composer, who gave the interview a week before Maharashtra announced the lockdown, said people need to see the film on the big screen. \"There is fear... Everyone is wondering \"how the hell is he releasing the film now, is he crazy?\" But I think the movie has to come out, people need to see it on the big screen. It is a cinematic experience,\" Rahman said. The musician firmly believes that a film\\'s box office success will have a ripple effect on the entertainment sector, which has been hit badly due to the pandemic. \"This is the time people should encourage filmmakers and producers because one film\\'s success is the entire industry\\'s success.

Directed by Vishwesh Krishnamoorthy, is co-written and produced by Rahman. He has also composed the film\\'s soundtrack. The film stars debutants Ehan Bhat and Edilsy Vargas in lead roles. The journey of the film began in 2010 when the composer decided to produce a movie. He came up with three rough story ideas and pitched them to his friends for feedback. All of them had their hearts set on one idea which eventually became \"The core idea is like a fairytale. What if a guy has to write 100 songs to win over a girl?\" Rahman said. A major Bollywood studio initially came on board to back the film but the deal fell through. He eventually found a co-producer in Ideal Entertainment who gave him complete freedom. \"We had a corporate production but I felt I would need more freedom to make the film. A panel of 12 people coming in and asking questions constantly was daunting. We quietly went off-grid from there and found Ideal Entertainment, who believed in the vision. Their excitement was empowering,\" Rahman said. Once the film had enough financial backing, the composer started scouting for a director who could bring to life his vision. He zeroed in on Krishnamoorthy, who had directed MTV\\'s musical show, which Rahman \"absolutely loved\". Rahman, one of the most regarded musicians in India and abroad for his compositions in films such as and to name just a few, said though he was juggling production and scoring music, there was never a thought to turn director for \"I was clear that I wouldn\\'t direct. I was inexperienced in direction. I am not a person who goes in front of people and directs, I am an introvert. \"I did direct a virtual reality experience which is coming out this year as an installation because it required only 18 days of shooting and four years of post-production. That I did, also because it wasn\\'t with Indian crew, so the inhibition was not there.\" is billed as a story about the self-discovery of a struggling singer, who wants to be a successful music composer. Rahman said the team was conscious to not turn the movie into merely a musical as they felt that the audience had increasingly become \"restless\" and wouldn\\'t have the patience to sit through it without being distracted. \"We had to find a way, decide what the emotional core of the film will be. It could not be just a musical.

After a nail-biting election day that extended by nearly a week, Democrat Joe Biden finally won the mantle of the 46th president of the United States of America on Saturday, 7 November, after a victory in Pennsylvania. Soon after the victory, Biden took to Twitter to say, “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country”. The Biden Campaign also released a statement from the president-elect on Saturday, in which he said, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.” Several US networks projected Biden as having won the presidential race after securing the key battleground of Pennsylvania, which helped him cross the 270 votes needed to win. With 20 electoral votes from the state, Biden now has a total of 273 electoral votes. He ran for president in 1988 but withdrew after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British leader Neil Kinnock. Biden ran for the presidency again in 2008 but later withdrew from the race. The candidates had been locked in a virtual dead heat for days, and\\xa0 reported that Trump’s chances of winning a second term depended on his ability to hang on to his leads in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania. However, Biden narrowed the gap in both states as vote counting progressed, finally winning Pennsylvania with 49.7 percent of the vote, as opposed to Trump’s 49.2 percent. Once he had gained ground in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia on Thursday he got to closer to defeating President Trump. “Democracy is sometimes messy.

Fifty-eight Trump administration appointees sought conversion from Jan. 1, 2020, to Jan 20, 2021, according to the Office of Personnel Management documents. Of those, 31 conversions were approved, six were denied, 15 were returned or withdrawn, and six remained pending. During the corresponding period under former President Barack Obama — Jan. 1, 2016 to Jan. 20, 2017 — 46 appointees sought conversion, with 36 approved, six denied and four returned or withdrawn. All but one of the 13 Trump administration political appointees who sought in the weeks between President Joe Biden’s election and inauguration were not approved, according to the OPM reports obtained by NBC News for the last quarter of 2020 and the first 20 days of January. Five requests were withdrawn or returned and six remained pending and under review by the OPM. By comparison, nine of the 11 Obama administration political appointees who requested approval for conversion to civil service jobs from Election Day 2016 through Trump’s inauguration were approved. At least one of those attempted conversions during that period under Trump was denied by the OPM because the agency said it couldn’t conclude the attempted appointment was free of “political influence,” according to the documents. The OPM tracks such conversion requests on a quarterly basis and subsequently provides the information to members of Congress. NBC News through the first three quarters of 2020. There is nothing new about Trump’s attempts to embed political appointees into civil service jobs; outgoing presidents have done it for years. (Civil service workers have protections that political appointees do not, and new administrations find it harder to fire them.) The latest disclosures reveal the extent to which Trump’s political appointees sought, in the former president’s final months, weeks and even days in office, to stay on in career government positions — a process some government watchdog groups called Successful conversions would give Trump a legacy of influence in parts of the federal government that would endure far past his time in the White House. Experts interviewed by NBC News expressed concerns over the numbers and timing of political appointees seeking conversion to permanent jobs after the election in particular, as well as about the number of appointees who had previously applied for and were granted conversions after the election. It is normal for some political appointees who are nearing the end of their time in government to seek stronger job security in permanent positions, as it is for some political appointees who are passionate about the work and who are qualified for relevant permanent jobs, experts said. But they also said that in this case, the large number of conversion applications and the post-election timing, as well as the large number of rejections by the OPM, were unusual. “You can see in the number of non-approvals by OPM that there are a bunch of political appointees [who sought career jobs] that are clearly problematic,” Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, said. “Why are these people only coming into these jobs only after the candidate who wanted them there has lost?” Nick Schwellenbach, a senior investigator at the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight, said: “It’s the kind of thing where people inside the administration know that it’s coming to an end. “Some of these people, either on their own, or at the behest of others, start seeking conversions so they can stick around.\" A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to requests for comment. The latest report obtained by NBC News also provided updates to previously pending conversion requests from the third quarter of 2020. Among those requests, on two occasions, a political appointee’s conversion request was denied because the OPM “could not conclude appointment was free of political influence and complied with merit system principles and applicable civil service laws and regulations.” One denial pertained to an unnamed political appointee inside the White House Counsel’s office who had requested approval for a conversion to be an attorney in an ethics job within the general counsel office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a crucial agency that regulates U.S. derivatives, options and futures markets. The other was a political appointee within a Montana office of the Department of Agriculture who had requested approval for a conversion to another Montana office within the agency. In both cases, the names of the appointees were redacted. Meanwhile, government watchdog groups expressed concerns over two people whose initial conversion requests had since been approved. One such conversion was that of Carl Risch, whose October conversion request to be the deputy director, the No. 2 job, at the Executive Office for Immigration Review within the Department of Justice (a civil service job), was approved in December. Risch had been an assistant secretary for consular affairs at the State Department, a political job. His new job came with a $10,000 raise. His is at least the , which conducts removal and deportation proceedings in immigration courts across the country. “It’s a red flag when there are multiple people being converted to jobs at a single entity. It really raises an even larger concern,” Stier, of the Partnership for Public Service, said. “The process is supposed to be that a political appointee in no way has a leg up on the competition for a career job, but when you see multiple go to the same agency, you really have to wonder how it can be possible that the best qualified individuals are not once, but multiple times, people who are political appointees.” Risch did not respond to multiple requests for comment. EOIR spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly said Risch went through the standard pre-hiring review process with the OPM and that the agency had approved his new position. Another conversion that drew attention from Schwellenbach, Stier and other experts was that of Keith Gray, whose July request to become the associate administrator at the Department of Agriculture’s risk management agency office was approved Jan. 17, just three days before Trump left office. Gray had been a chief of staff at the division, which helps determine farming subsidies for certain groups of farmers. His new job came with a $26,000 raise. Stier pointed to that says a career job opening “cannot be created or tailored solely for the benefit of the current or former political appointee” as a reason that the conversion of Gray, who had held a leadership position in the division, caught his eye. “The fact that he is getting a job inside the division that he was the chief of staff of, I don’t really know how you do that within the confines of the OPM review process,” he said. “I don’t know how you can be assured that it was a free and fair competition when you have someone on the inside throwing their hat in. It strikes me, on its surface, as implausible that it was a free and fair competition.” The nonpartisan government watchdog raised questions over Gray’s conversion to a career job Gray did not respond to multiple messages. The Department of Agriculture and its risk management division both declined to comment. Separately, government watchdog groups pointed to apparent ongoing attempts to embed political appointees at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a pivotal agency that regulates the transmission, transportation and sale of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. FERC also reviews proposals to build interstate natural gas and oil pipelines. Half of the pending conversions from the period from Election Day through Trump’s last day in office were for conversions of employees elsewhere in the federal government to civil service jobs at FERC. Two requests, filed Dec. 22 and 23 with the OPM, were for conversions to “attorney advisor” jobs within the agency. A third, filed Jan. 4 with the OPM, was for a trial attorney job inside FERC’s legal department. The names of the people, and their initial political appointment positions, were redacted. E&E News, a widely read energy trade publication owned by Politico, reported in December that FERC had been politicized during the Trump administration. In November, Trump fired the commission’s chairman in a rare move that was viewed by many as an act of retribution for comments he had made supporting climate action. “Having political people burrow in at an agency like FERC is a huge problem with real consequences,” Stier said. “Just look at what happened in Texas,” he added, referring to the fact that that its power grid wouldn’t handle a brutal cold snap went unheeded, leaving . FERC spokeswoman Mary O’Driscoll said in a statement, “It is not unusual for either Republican or Democratic commissioners to hire current or former political appointees from other agencies as advisors” and that “all FERC hiring procedures are done with the oversight and approval of OPM.” Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., as the chair of the House Subcommittee on Government Operations, has pushed for more transparency surrounding the number and identities of conversions to civil service jobs requested during the Trump administration. He said the names and situations identified by NBC News in the latest reports prove how crucial an apolitical civil service is for the government to function successfully — and called for measures that would further examine all, and possibly remove some, of Trump’s conversions from their jobs. “Our country is just now coming out of a pandemic, and continued progress requires a civil service of committed, competent officials. Many of President Trump’s political appointees were openly and unapologetically committed to tearing down the institutions they were tasked to serve and lacked expertise,” he said in a statement. “To allow them to continue in the federal government will hurt all Americans and they must be removed,” he added.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='127f22e7-6b9d-4008-997a-004063b4a0ff', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/can-asymptomatic-kids-sustain-coronavirus-for-longer-than-adults-287039', 'title': 'Can asymptomatic kids sustain coronavirus for longer than adults?', 'published_date': 'New Delhi, India', 'language': 'en'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='A study undertaken by Chinese researchers claims that kids who contract COVID-19 might display mild symptoms, recover, but still carry the virus.

If he’s ever going to prove his point, now is the time. The television executive is behind the network’s 2019 revival and, since he began working last fall to convince Minnesota authorities to televise Derek Chauvin’s trial, has seen the case as an opportunity to let more people know that is back. Early returns are encouraging: The network says the number of live streams of programming during the first week of the former Minneapolis police officer’s trial for the murder of George Floyd was 20 times what it was pre-trial. “When you say , everyone knows who you are,” said Tufts, the network’s senior vice president. “But when you launch a new network, people have to find you.” Originally started by journalist Steven Brill in 1991, became known for coverage of sensational trials involving OJ Simpson and the Menendez brothers. But then-corporate owner Time Warner changed it to in 2008, believing a broader-based entertainment network would have more appeal. Tufts, who has been involved in legal programming since producing ’s in the 1990s, believed owners gave up too soon. He never lost faith in as a concept and tried to convince media companies to bring it back. Katz Broadcasting, a subsidiary of the EW Scripps Co, agreed to try. Similarly, some of the people who worked on yearned for their own chance to return, said Michael Ayala. He was a reporter for in the 1990s, left to work at CBS stations in Chicago and Washington, and is now back as a anchor. Vinnie Politan, an anchor, is another returnee, along with a handful of behind-the-scenes employees. “It feels fantastic,” Ayala said. “I cannot express to you enough how happy I am.” Virtually all lawyers in the early days, the network now has more people with television experience, he said. But the focus on covering issues from a legal perspective hasn’t changed. In prime time this week, for example, Ayala discussed a US Supreme Court ruling on the use of force by police officers and how Chauvin’s attorney quoted from it during a cross-examination. Viewer opinion was solicited on the question of whether Chauvin was justified in believing that the crowd at the scene of Floyd’s death posed a threat. Anyone who watched ’s programming during the Simpson trial will find coverage of the Chauvin case to be similar, Ayala told . Not only was Minnesota convinced by and other media organisations to televise the Chauvin trial, but cameras provide the video feed for colleagues. “I’m proud of our team,” Tufts said. “We’ve delivered on our mission to provide expert analysis based on facts and the law. So much (other) coverage is devoted to one political position or another.” He said he went into the Chauvin trial with hopes that would get an audience boost of 20 percent to 50 percent. Nielsen says the first week provided with its biggest television audience since the reboot, and suggests that Tufts’ goal may have been too modest. “It has given viewers a broader awareness that we’re there,” he said. While the pandemic has cut down on the number of trials available for television, it has provided one gift, even if temporary. The US Supreme Court has held arguments on many of its cases by teleconference, and has been airing that audio. Tufts acquired the entire library of programming from 1991 until its end, including all the old trial tapes. It took seven semi-trailers to transport tapes from storage in New Jersey to the new Atlanta headquarters, and the material is being digitally converted. It was already mined for a 25-part series on the 25th anniversary of the Simpson trial. faces competition it did not have before, including Dan Abrams’ Law & Crime Network, which has operated since 2017. YouTube is also a popular destination for people interested in old trial footage, said Larry Gerbrandt, principal in Media Valuation Partners, which consults on media properties. “It’s a little bit of a gift to be the channel of record (on the Chauvin trial) and essentially cover it gavel to gavel,” he said.

Elections to 234 Assembly seats in Tamil Nadu will be held on April 6, with counting to be taken up on May 2. \\xa0 Jayakumar, senior AIADMK leader and state fisheries minister, has bulldozed candidates of DMK and its ally Congress in four consecutive elections, made the constituency an AIADMK bastion and established his virtually undisputed supremacy. Jayakumar, also the AIADMK organising secretary, scripted his own success in remaining as the MLA of Royapuram Assembly constituency for a quarter of a century, inflicting humiliating defeats on successive DMK and Congress candidates who challenged him. \"DJ Annan,\" (elder brother) as he is affectionately called by his supporters in his constituency, had lost only during the 1996 assembly election to DMK\\'s R Mathivanan, when a strong anti-incumbency swept away the then ruling AIADMK in the hustings. \\xa0 He registered his first impressive win in the 1991 election, trouncing Mathivanan and maintained his winning streak in elections in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. His different campaign styles continue to draw crowds and the ever smiling former Assembly Speaker does not hesitate to wear the white cap similar to that worn by party founder and late chief minister M G Ramachandran, or sing a popular number from \"Puratchi Thalaivar\\'s\" films, to connect with the people. Ramachandran is addressed as \\'Puratchi Thalaivar,\\' meaning revolutionary leader. \\xa0 Jayakumar even sprang a surprise recently by playing kabaddi with the youth on his way home after winding up the day\\'s hectic election campaign. His unparalleled popularity is something that cannot be underestimated, but rival DMK insists a change is required. \"It is time for change, the time for the Rising Sun (DMK symbol) under the leadership M K Stalin to emerge,\" has been the constant refrain of the party\\'s 54-year old candidate R Murthy\\'s election campaign. He is the proprietor of iDream Cinemas and iDream properties. \\xa0 But Jayakumar, contesting for the seventh time from his home turf, is confident of emerging victorious this time too. Despite its mixed bag of communities, traffic woes of residents of Royapuram assembly constituency have not ended. Fishermen, who play a major role in tilting the scales, are apprehensive of the multi-crore developmental programmes in the coastal villages as these threaten their livelihood opportunities. \"DMK\\'s assurance for a sea bridge project connecting Chennai Port-Thiruvottriyur to eliminate traffic congestion and fasten commercial access to and out of the port is not needed. This will only corrode the livelihood opportunities of the fisher folk,\" says Bharathi Ku, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association (SIFWA). \\xa0 \"What we need is livelihood protection initiatives, not multi-crore projects that eat into our villages,\" he argues. The fishermen are also opposed to establishing desalination plants in the coastal villages. \"The ever increasing population and floating population of at least 50,000 people on an average per day into Royapuram for trading and other activities makes this constituency prone to frequent traffic snarls,besides taxing existing resources,\" 60-year old Jayakumar, who hails from the fishing community, told P T I. \\xa0 Despite being a small area, the density of population is high and streets are narrow in Royapuram. Not less than 3,500 autos make sorties into Royapuram on any given day, Jayakumar, who is also an advocate, claims. \"So this calls for implementing a master plan to meet the increasing requirements of the people.

APSEZ had announced acquisition of Warburg Pincus' 31.5 per cent stake in GPL on March 3, 2021, and together with this acquisition, APSEZ would have 89.6 per cent stake in GPL. \\x93Ports play a major role in shaping the future. Through APSEZ's 89.6 per cent stake in Gangavaram port, the Adani Group will greatly expand its pan-India cargo presence. As India's largest private sector port developer and operator, we will accelerate India's and AP's industrialisation,\\x94 Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani said in a tweet. \\xa0 It is the second largest non-major port in Andhra Pradesh with a 64 MT capacity established under concession from Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) that extends till 2059. It is an all-weather, deep water, multipurpose port capable of handling fully laden super cape size vessels of up to 2,00,000 DWT, the statement said. Currently, GPL operates 9 berths and has free hold land of 1,800 acres. With a master plan capacity for 250 MTPA with 31 berths, GPL has sufficient headroom to support future growth. GPL handles a diverse mix of dry and bulk commodities including coal, iron ore, fertilizer, limestone, bauxite, sugar, alumina and steel. \\xa0 GPL is the gateway port for a hinterland spread over 8 states across eastern, southern and central India, the statement said adding it will benefit from APSEZ's pan-India footprint. Karan Adani, CEO and Whole Time Director of APSEZ said, \\x93The acquisition of GPL is a further augmentation of our vision of capitalizing on an expanded logistics network effect that generates greater value as it expands.\\x94 He added that \\x93the associated hinterland we will now be able to tap into is one of the fastest growing in the eastern region and with the logistic synergies APSEZ brings to the table, GPL has a potential to become a 250 MT port. This will undoubtedly help accelerate the industrialisation of AP.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2493, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='c2b472f1-a402-47c9-9f32-29260d57aad6', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/economy/250321/regulation-should-not-constrain-innovation-in-fintech-space-rbi-gover.html', 'title': 'Regulation should not constrain innovation in fintech space: RBI governor', 'published_date': 'Mar 25, 2021, 12:20 pm IST', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='96aaeea3-f09f-4842-8e27-9d4259726054', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/economy/250321/regulation-should-not-constrain-innovation-in-fintech-space-rbi-gover.html', 'title': 'Regulation should not constrain innovation in fintech space: RBI governor', 'published_date': 'Mar 25, 2021, 12:20 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='af71746a67216818a99e5b0409a53e0a69104fee11c092ff16e6b378d3a6ffdc'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5b3df319-32ec-4e9e-ba88-6076b724c60f', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/companies/230321/adani-ports-to-acquire-controlling-stake-in-gangavaram-port-for-rs-36.html', 'title': 'Adani Ports to acquire controlling stake in Gangavaram Port for Rs 3,604 cr', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 1:21 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='f946b8e4b222093cf5fd75a20d665d0ce5572715b8252497ab5ee18d7be43d0c'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='46c2ea52-984a-4605-8637-834143119df4', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='976430ed8643a511f0c1e0442bf3e49098d5d8e114d4473b92c4054bc168a9de')}, text='Underlining the need for innovation in the financial sector for effective service delivery, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday called for effective regulation that should help innovation in the fintech space and not suffocate it.

Stock markets heaved a sigh of relief, with the S&P 500 reversing losses.\\xa0 Talking tough on China and criticizing the Obama administration\\'s more measured approach is a key part of Trump\\'s re-election strategy. Sticking with the pact may mean accepting that China is likely to fall short of purchase commitments for US\\xa0agricultural goods, manufactured products, energy and services - goals that many said were unrealistic\\xa0even before the pandemic. Canceling the deal, though, would reignite the nearly two-year US-China trade war at a time US\\xa0unemployment is at its worst since the 1930s Great Depression. The next US\\xa0step would likely be reviving previously planned but canceled tariffs on some $165 billion worth of Chinese consumer goods, including Apple cellphones and computers, toys and clothing - all ultimately paid by US\\xa0companies and passed on to consumers. Beijing would retaliate with tariffs on US\\xa0goods, fueling more market turmoil and delaying recovery. \"He\\'s stuck with a lemon. He gets an empty agreement if he sticks with it, and he gets more actions that create an economic drag and more volatility if he abandons it,\" said one person briefed on the administration\\'s trade deliberations. US\\xa0goods exports\\xa0to China in the first quarter were down $4 billion from the trade war-damaged levels a year earlier, according to US\\xa0Census Bureau data. The Peterson Institute of International Economics estimates\\xa0that during the first quarter, China made only about 40% of the purchases it needed to stay on target for a first-year increase of $77 billion over 2017 levels, implying an extremely steep climb in the second half. Leaving the deal now would not buy a lasting political bounce for Trump in manufacturing-heavy swing states with five months to go before the presidential election, analysts say. Trump blames China for failing to contain the coronavirus and has repeatedly said the deal, including its pledges to boost US\\xa0exports to China by $200 billion over two years, no longer means as much to him with US\\xa0coronavirus deaths now over 100,000 and job losses piling up. Trump said on Friday that China was \"absolutely smothering Hong Kong’s freedom,\" but refrained from harsh sanctions that could put the trade deal in jeopardy, taking milder steps to revoke the territory\\'s separate travel and customs benefits from China.\\xa0 Claire Reade, a former US\\xa0trade negotiator, said Trump\\'s \"peripheral steps\" would not deter Beijing from proceeding with the security law, as it regards Hong Kong as a core national security issue.\\xa0 \\xa0 \"Probably the most significant thing from the trade perspective is that the Phase 1 trade deal is – for now anyway - unaffected,\" said Reade, senior counsel with Arnold and Porter law firm in Washington.\\xa0 White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow criticized Beijing last week, but on trade told CNBC: \"It’s a complex relationship. The China Phase 1 trade deal does continue to go on for the moment and we may be making progress there.\"\\xa0 US\\xa0Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has recently cited\\xa0\"continuing progress\" in the deal, after China welcomed US\\xa0blueberries, barley, beef and dairy products. He has touted the deal\\'s dispute settlement mechanism, which provides for regular consultations on compliance with Beijing\\'s commitments on intellectual property protections, financial services, agriculture standards and purchases.\\xa0 US-China flashpoints on Hong Kong, Taiwan and other issues did not derail negotiations that resulted in new concessions from China, said Jamieson Greer, who served as Lighthizer\\'s chief of staff until April.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4467, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='17532edd-36e2-4770-ac67-c7e374c8e763', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/lemon-or-not-trump-is-stuck-with-phase-1-china-trade-deal-302369', 'title': \"'Lemon' or not, Trump is stuck with Phase 1 China trade deal\", 'published_date': 'Washington DC', 'language': 'en'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='91911da7-7d77-470a-a2c3-430d8f9b6156', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/lemon-or-not-trump-is-stuck-with-phase-1-china-trade-deal-302369', 'title': \"'Lemon' or not, Trump is stuck with Phase 1 China trade deal\", 'published_date': 'Washington DC', 'language': 'en'}, hash='9513be6170da4355deee8f288da5d1a9691ecd26558f0b6efbf7400c4e36576d'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='fc004007-cc26-41be-be7a-a8dfd5cf05ac', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/lemon-or-not-trump-is-stuck-with-phase-1-china-trade-deal-302369', 'title': \"'Lemon' or not, Trump is stuck with Phase 1 China trade deal\", 'published_date': 'Washington DC', 'language': 'en'}, hash='7485724fe0fa01e063127bc03ff8c2686b6859e681b6cb52a5586ddcc4b3dcf2'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='d8027aea-73ab-48d8-8ae8-f4f408bd9fd3', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='10c1a7a6f0331f4f84c05f1a74a216aab19f98aae948481a0a3bba688ebaca64')}, text='\"Some of these security and human rights challenges have certainly complicated the atmosphere, but the trade agreement can still provide a set of rules governing important aspects of the trade relationship,\" said Greer, now an international trade partner at the King and Spalding law firm.

Just last week, in a “swift U-turn” on Thursday following a “political backlash”, the Pakistan government had “deferred” its move to import cotton and sugar from India and linked it to the condition that India should first restore Article 370 on Jammu and Kashmir that was abrogated two years ago.\\xa0However, some optimistic Pakistani media reports are referring to this as a “temporary bump”.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1657, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='6d01a33c-fdeb-4415-bf40-8734d1e866a3', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/as-bushfires-rage-and-choke-sydney-australian-pm-denies-link-to-climate-policies-263569', 'title': 'As bushfires rage and choke Sydney, Australian PM denies link to climate policies', 'published_date': 'Sydney, Australia', 'language': 'en'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='369618a6-5c71-4ba9-8af1-674a2389992e', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/as-bushfires-rage-and-choke-sydney-australian-pm-denies-link-to-climate-policies-263569', 'title': 'As bushfires rage and choke Sydney, Australian PM denies link to climate policies', 'published_date': 'Sydney, Australia', 'language': 'en'}, hash='3eb62049845c0354c58d2e6278c7c14abf3d40efedfdefcd55e5fabdd4c40028'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='66968cb7-919c-4ec7-8b5d-3a5b78fce57e', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/politics/090421/india-sidesteps-queries-on-secret-talks-with-pakistan.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, hash='ccdc595de2f11ee14aaad10a7356256047437986fd65e788d376c70baedde816'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6e7a9c02-ddf7-4c3a-8b6c-5ad84a7a7ae3', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='52b95633e51aeb9fab4192b521d9786f4a6c14f3be4d6cb2d51eb9032fa62631')}, text='Australia\\'s Prime Minister on Thursday denied his climate policies had caused ravaging the country and insisted his government was doing enough to tackle global warming. As dozens of new blazes scorched the countryside and the country\\'s largest city was cloaked in hazardous smoke, conservative leader Scott Morrison defended his climate record, saying Australia was \"doing our bit\". His comments came after weeks spent refusing to speak about the link between climate change and deadly fires described by the emergency services as unprecedented in number and scale for the early bushfire season. As more people in the southeast of the country were told to evacuate their homes and schoolchildren in Sydney were again forced to play indoors, Morrison dismissed mounting calls for action. \"The suggestion that any way shape or form that Australia, accounting for 1.3 per cent of the world\\'s emissions... are impacting directly on specific fire events, whether it is here or anywhere else in the world, that doesn\\'t bear up to credible scientific evidence,\" he told ABC radio. Scientists, former fire chiefs and residents touched by bushfires have all drawn the link between this season\\'s more intense fires and climate change. Drought, unseasonably hot, dry and windy conditions have fuelled the unprecedented blazes. Scientists believe many of those factors are made worse by rising global temperatures. On Thursday bushfires burned across every region of Australia with residents in Victoria warned to leave high-risk areas and officials in New South Wales reporting more than 600 homes have been destroyed in recent weeks. Morrison is facing calls to cut greenhouse gas emissions and rapidly transition to renewable energy -- a sensitive debate in light of Australia\\'s lucrative mining industry. Australia has committed to globally agreed climate targets to help limit warming, but its emissions continue to rise and targets are only being met with the use of some creative carbon accounting,\\xa0using credits gained in past decades. While Australia\\'s burning of fossil fuels accounts for only a fraction of global emissions, coal dug up Down Under and burned around the world makes the country a major emissions exporter. \\' east coast have claimed six lives since mid-October. Now the fire danger has moved into states further south, with more than 60 fires breaking out in Victoria on Thursday,\\xa0including five at \"emergency\" level,\\xa0after a so-called \"Code Red\" fire danger was declared for the first time in a decade. Victoria Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said firefighters were batting \"some of the worst conditions that you\\'d expect to see, often in February or March, and we\\'re seeing them in November\". \"It is incredibly dry, it will continue to get drier as the months go on over this summer, so the conditions we see today are likely conditions that we\\'ll confront over this summer,\" she said. The Bureau of Meteorology said \"large areas\" of central and eastern Victoria broke maximum temperature records for November,\\xa0including in Melbourne where the mercury reached 40.9 Celsius, while a dramatic dust storm swept through the town of Mildura, turning the sky a vivid orange. Country Fire Authority chief Steve Warrington earlier told people living in high-risk rural areas to leave for the safety of cities. \"We are saying, \\'do not be there, do not be there when a fire occurs, because you will not survive if you are there\\',\" he said. The fire danger was also elevated to \"extreme\" in the island state of Tasmania off mainland Australia\\'s southeastern coast, one of several areas where a total fire ban was declared. For the second time in three days, , Australia\\'s biggest city and an area that is home to more than five million people, sending air quality plummeting to hazardous levels. In South Australia, the state capital Adelaide was also shrouded in bushfire smoke and residents were being told to stay indoors for health reasons.

The Biden administration through the US\\xa0Trade Representative\\'s Office (USTR) faced a Sunday (Apr 11) night deadline on whether to take the rare step of reversing a US\\xa0International Trade Commission decision unless the companies had agreed a deal. An announcement of the battery makers\\' settlement is expected soon, the sources said. The agreement is a win for President Joe Biden who has made boosting electric vehicles and US\\xa0battery production a top priority. The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs, and Biden has proposed spending US$174 billion to hike EV sales and expand charging infrastructure. The accord puts an end to a bitter two-year dispute between affiliates of two of South Korea\\'s biggest conglomerates. After losing out to SK in its bid to win Volkswagen orders, LG accused SK of stealing trade secrets by poaching nearly 80 of its employees. The ITC in February sided with LG Chem after the company accused SK of misappropriating trade secrets related to EV battery technology and issued a 10-year-import ban, but it allowed SK to import components for batteries for Ford\\'s EV F-150 program for four years, and Volkswagen\\'s North American EVs for two years. SK vowed to walk away from its US$2.6 billion Georgia battery plant under construction if the ITC decision was not overturned. The ITC also faulted what it called SK\\'s \"egregious misconduct\" and SK\\'s destruction of documents ordered by company executives. Ford, VW, LG and SK declined to comment. Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh wrote in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that if the ITC decision were left in place, it could \"reduce US\\xa0battery capacity and delay the transition to electric vehicles\". LG first filed a complaint against SK in 2019 and both sides hired numerous lawyers and consultants to make their case to the Biden administration. The administration has been pushing the two companies to try to reach a settlement, as have VW and Ford, the sources said. US\\xa0Trade Representative Katherine Tai has been personally involved in the settlement discussions and urged both companies to come to a resolution, sources said. USTR declined to comment. SK in March received proposed terms from LG, including financial reparations to address LG\\'s trade secrets misappropriation claims, Reuters reported earlier citing a person familiar with the situation. Georgia is home to two newly-elected Democratic US\\xa0Senators who are a linchpin of Biden\\'s slim Congressional majority and have both spoken about the importance of ensuring the Georgia plant\\'s future. Both senators repeatedly pressed the companies to reach agreement. Warnock praised the reported deal that will ensure the Georgia plant\\'s survival, saying in a statement on Saturday that it \"will help keep the local economy moving forward\". Last month, Georgia\\'s Republican Governor Brian Kemp urged Biden to intervene, noting SK\\'s plant will employ nearly 2,600 and is the largest foreign investment in the state\\'s history: \"Simply put: the livelihoods of thousands of Georgians are now in your hands.\" LG\\'s battery unit LG Energy Solution is nearing completion of an Ohio cell manufacturing plant with General Motors and is close to announcing plans to build a US$2.3 billion second facility in Tennessee, sources told Reuters. LG has said it can handle the battery needs of automakers if SK abandons its Georgia plant. SK has said LG could not handle the VW and Ford contracts, and that Chinese manufacturers could step in to meet demand.

Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Iran Atomic Energy Organisation (IAEO), condemned a \"futile\" act, while urging the international community to \"confront this anti-nuclear terrorism\", in a statement carried by state television. The attack was carried out by \"opponents of the country\\'s industrial and political progress, who aim to prevent development of a thriving nuclear industry,\" he said, without specifying what country or entity might be behind the alleged sabotage. IAEO spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi had earlier reported an accident at the enrichment facility caused by a \"power failure\". No one was injured and there was no radioactive release, the official Fars news agency reported, citing the spokesman. Kamalvandi said there had been \"an accident in part of the electrical circuit of the enrichment facility\" at the Natanz complex near Tehran. \"The causes of the accident are under investigation and more details will be released later,\" he added, before the later statement put out by the agency\\'s chief. He did not say whether power was cut only in the enrichment facility or across other installations at the site. Malek Chariati, spokesman for the Iranian parliament\\'s energy commission, took to Twitter to allege sabotage. \"This incident, coming (the day after) National Nuclear Technology Day, as Iran endeavours to press the West into lifting sanctions, is strongly suspected to be sabotage or infiltration,\" Chariati said. Iran\\'s President Hassan Rouhani had on Saturday inaugurated a cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium and two test cascades at Natanz, in a ceremony broadcast by state television. An Israeli public broadcast journalist, Amichai Stein, said on Twitter \"the assessment is that the fault\" at Natanz is the \"result of an Israeli cyber operation\", without elaborating or providing evidence to corroborate his claim. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said later Sunday that \"the struggle against Iran and its proxies and the Iranian armament efforts is a huge mission\". \"The situation that exists today will not necessarily be the situation that will exist tomorrow,\" he added, without elaborating. Netanyahu made the remarks during an event involving intelligence service Mossad and the army for Israel\\'s independence anniversary. Iran\\'s president had on Saturday also inaugurated a replacement factory at Natanz, after an explosion at a facility making advanced centrifuges there last July. Iranian authorities likewise blamed the July incident on \"sabotage\" by \"terrorists\", but have not released the results of their investigation into it. The equipment inaugurated Saturday enables quicker enrichment of uranium and in higher quantities, to levels that violate Iran\\'s commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal it agreed with the five permanent United Nations Security Council powers, plus Germany. The administration of then-US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from this multilateral nuclear accord in 2018 and re-imposed biting sanctions on Iran. Iran later responded by progressively rolling back its own commitments under the agreement. Trump\\'s successor Joe Biden has said he is prepared to return to the deal, arguing it had - until Washington\\'s withdrawal - been successful in dramatically scaling back Iran\\'s nuclear activities. Iran\\'s latest move to step up uranium enrichment follows an opening round of talks in Vienna Tuesday with representatives of the remaining parties to the nuclear deal on bringing the US back into it. The talks are focused not only on lifting the crippling economic sanctions Trump reimposed, but also on bringing Iran back into compliance. Iran\\'s nemesis Israel has always been implacably opposed to the 2015 accord. In November last year, Iran\\'s top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was killed by machine gun fire while travelling on a highway outside Tehran. Iran\\'s elite Revolutionary Guards said a satellite-controlled gun with \"artificial intelligence\" was used in the attack, which Tehran blamed on Israel. Uranium enrichment can produce the fuel for a nuclear reactor, or in highly extended form, the fissile core of an atomic warhead. It is one of the most sensitive nuclear activities carried out by Iran. Rouhani had again underlined at Saturday\\'s ceremony that Tehran\\'s nuclear programme is solely for \"peaceful\" purposes.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4732, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='17f5d499-1a56-4a44-a593-a56a90390a54', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'World', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/suspected-islamists-free-1300-prisoners-from-east-congo-jail/', 'title': 'Suspected Islamists free 1,300 prisoners from east Congo jail', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a749d59d-9254-4983-a05b-4584ae04c3c3', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'World', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/suspected-islamists-free-1300-prisoners-from-east-congo-jail/', 'title': 'Suspected Islamists free 1,300 prisoners from east Congo jail', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='caa7a49938f6dc3e6173facf240de0fe320cbd9875bcc9e65c47a3277726cbab'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='cb1c0ada-01d2-4f3f-81c0-47480e04a870', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'World', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/iran-atomic-agency-says-nuclear-facility-hit-by-act-of-terrorism-14601380', 'title': \"Iran atomic agency says nuclear facility hit by act of 'terrorism'\", 'published_date': '12 Apr 2021 03:47AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, hash='c502cd40c5de39adadf73bc4d39e13f3e38cdbb6e2615357fab14b83381ccd91'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5f128a9d-b502-4160-a4df-1f29b34a5705', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='4ed1c441eaa01b5cbfd84f53454da2ae49351a64f792f66086794160bd4cb087')}, text='Suspected Islamists free 1,300 prisoners from east Congo jail. Armed men freed more than 1,300 prisoners from a jail in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a coordinated attack on Tuesday, the town’s mayor said, blaming an Islamist militant group operating in the area. Militants stage 1,300-prisoner Congo jailbreak Only 110 of 1,456 inmates, including a number of militia fighters, remained following the simultaneous early morning assaults on the Kangbayi central prison in Beni and the military camp defending it, said Modeste Bakwanamaha. “The attackers, who came in large numbers, managed to break the door with electrical equipment,” Bakwanamaha told Reuters. “We believe it was the ADF who did this.” The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has killed more than 1,000 civilians since the start of 2019, according to U.N. figures, despite repeated military campaigns aimed at destroying it. Islamic State said fighters from its Central African Province franchise carried out the attack, according to its AMAQ news agency. The group has claimed responsibility for several suspected ADF attacks in the past. But U.N. experts have consistently found that claims ADF is linked to international jihadists are overblown or false, said Dan Fahey, a former U.N. investigator. Escapes are common from Congo’s overcrowded and poorly secured prisons. A similar number of inmates escaped when the same jail was attacked in June 2017. “This sounds more like an attack by Mai Mai (local rebels), who did the attack three years ago,” Fahey said. ‘MAY THE STATE HAVE MERCY’ Two inmates were shot dead during Tuesday’s raid, which started at around 4:30 a.m., police said on Twitter. The bolt on the prison’s front door appeared to be cut, as well as the metal grate behind it, Reuters TV footage in the aftermath of the raid showed. “We were sleeping in the morning, but around 4:00 we heard a really loud exchange of fire,” said Lukiya Bafana Ruban, one of the few inmates who decided not to flee. “May the state have mercy on us because we voluntarily stayed here in prison.” Kangbayi prison holds members of local rebel groups as well as ADF fighters. Bakwanamaha said there were rumours ADF fighters in the prison were preparing a break-out in the days preceding the attack. By midday around 20 prisoners had returned to the prison, he added. A year ago the army launched a large-scale counter-insurgency campaign against the ADF.

Under-60s can still decide to take the vaccine but only following \"consultation with the doctor carrying out the vaccination ... and with an individual risk analysis,\" said ministers of Germany\\'s 16 states as well as the federal health minister in a policy statement. \\xa0 The World Health Organization and the EU\\'s health watchdog have both deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine safe, but several countries have restricted its use over clotting fears. Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that experts have recorded in recent weeks \"very rare but very serious cases of thrombosis\" in people vaccinated with AstraZeneca. \"They are findings that (Germany\\'s vaccine commission) and finally us, cannot ignore,\" she said. Germany\\'s vaccine commission known as STIKO earlier Tuesday recommended that use of the jabs be halted for under-60s because of \"currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects\" in younger vaccinated people. \\xa0 It intends to make another recommendation by the end of April on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received a first dose of the vaccine, it said. Pending this decision, ministers said people who are due for their second jab can either choose to take it if cleared by their attending doctor, or they can opt to wait for the commission to make its recommendation. The latest restrictions amounted to a new setback for the vaccine developed by the Anglo-Swedish laboratory. Nevertheless Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany would be able to meet its goal of offering every adult a coronavirus jab by the end of the summer. \\xa0 Just after it received approval from European regulator EMA for use in the bloc, Germany restricted the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s because of insufficient data. After clearing it for older people subsequently, Germany along with several EU nations suspended its use again in mid-March because of clotting fears. Just over a week after allowing its use again, German authorities have now again halted its use among younger people. Merkel insisted however that it is such careful consideration and transparency that can keep the public\\'s confidence in the vaccine. \\xa0 \"Trust stems from the knowledge that every suspicion, every individual case will be examined,\" she said. The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people. Germany\\'s medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday. Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week. \\xa0 On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s \"pending further analysis\". The AstraZeneca vaccine has had something of a rollercoaster ride. Britain, which developed it, staunchly supports its use, South Africa has rejected it outright. France has limited its use to over-55s, while Spain has done the same for under-65s.

Naik observed that the applicant is charged under Section 376 of IPC, hence, the court is not inclined to grant such relief in this case. However, the applicant may approach the appropriate court, the Judge had said. Later, a Delhi court had also refused the anticipatory bail application of Hiremath, while observing that if the woman states in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent.

The coronavirus dominated the opening minutes of the Trump-Biden face-off with President Trump terming the contagion a worldwide problem . This has been a worldwide problem, but I’ve been congratulated by many countries on what we’ve been able to do, he said at the debate held in Nashville, Tennessee. “We have a coronavirus vaccine that’s coming, it’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks and it’s going to be delivered, the President said, adding that companies like Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer are doing very well on that front. Trump claimed that he had done a good job with a worldwide pandemic, saying the country needs to learn to live with it. Responding to the President, Biden said that Trump has no plan. He always says people are learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it, Biden said. I will take care of this. I will make sure we have a plan, the former vice president said. Biden said that this is a dark winter as he came down heavily on the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic. Trump praised the US response to the pandemic, claiming that the crisis is going away . On the question of lockdown, Trump said: We don’t have the ability to lock ourselves in basement . We’re not going to shut down and we have to open our schools, Trump said. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, Trump said.

Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a military crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup. \\xa0 The junta\\'s violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar\\'s myriad ethnic armed groups. The US State Department said it was ordering the departure of \"non-emergency US government employees and their family members\". The decision was taken to protect the safety and security of staff and their families, the State Department said. World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta cadres with sanctions. But the pressure has not swayed the generals. Saturday, the annual Armed Forces Day, saw the biggest loss of life so far, with at least 107 people killed. \\xa0 The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar\\'s 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions. Three of them -- the Ta\\'ang National Liberation Army, the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army (AA) -- on Tuesday threatened to join protesters\\' fight unless the military reined in its crackdown. While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days. \\xa0 A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible. The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes. Further strikes were launched on Tuesday, but Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU\\'s head of foreign affairs, said the group would continue its position of \"strongly supporting people\\'s movement against (the) military coup\". The KNU\\'s Fifth Brigade put out a statement on Tuesday condemning the air strikes and warning it had no option but to \"confront these serious threats\" posed by the military. \\xa0 Around 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes. The Thai foreign ministry said late Tuesday about 2,300 have returned to Myanmar, while about 550 remain in Thailand. Karen activists have accused the Thai authorities of pushing people back and accused them of blocking UN refugee officials from the area.

According to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Google search trends reflect a 75 per cent spike in people seeking help against violence at home. Australia, like most countries in the world, has shut down non-essential services to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. To further tackle the domestic violence issue, the government has sanctioned a US $100 million package. This money has been allocated to support services that deal with cases of domestic abuse. A charity in Australia with the name “Women’s Safety” reported over a 40 per cent surge in clients calling for help. The charity functions in the state of New South Wales, and claimed that most cases were related to lockdown induced by the pandemic, news agency AFP reported. In the state of Victoria, “Wayss”, another support service for women, claims that the number of domestic cases had doubled over the last week. They believe this is a peculiar state of affairs. Wayss’ chief executive Liz Thomas, in conversation with ABC said that this surge may be attributed to lack of release elsewhere, which was otherwise accessible to the public. \"We\\'ve also seen half a dozen examples in the past week where perpetrators have actually used Covid-19 as a form of abuse - telling their partner that they have the virus, therefore they can\\'t leave the house\", she told ABC.

No motivation was immediately known. With Congress unable to agree on broad new gun regulations, like stricter background checks for gun buyers, Biden announced six executive measures which he said would help tamp down the crisis. Republicans immediately attacked the proposal, with the party\\'s senior leader in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, warning of \"unconstitutional overreach.\" In addition to relatively modest moves on the politically hyper-sensitive issue, Biden used his Rose Garden speech to announce the nomination of David Chipman, a gun-control proponent and former law enforcement officer, as head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Reflecting the lack of unity in Washington around anything to do with firearms restrictions, the ATF - a key agency in the fight against gun violence - has not had a Senate-confirmed director since 2015. Biden\\'s six measures included a proposed rule to \"stop proliferation of ghost guns,\" as firearms built from home kits are known. The White House says these homemade weapons are especially of concern because they have no serial numbers and cannot be traced after being used in crimes. Another proposed rule will be tightening regulations on arm braces designed to stabilize pistols, a device used by the man who killed 10 people in a Colorado grocery store last month. Under the rule, pistols with braces would be classified as short-barreled rifles, putting them under stricter control. Other measures include boosting support for agencies involved in tackling community violence and ordering the first comprehensive report on firearms trafficking in the United States since 2000. Nearly 40,000 Americans die each year from shootings. While mass shootings like recent killings in Colorado, Georgia and California attract most attention, more than half of the annual death toll is due to suicide. Biden said his proposals were just a start and urged Congress to take on far-reaching measures, like added background checks and ending the sale of powerful rifles often used in mass killings. \"I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one. But even here, there is much more common ground than anyone would believe,\" he said. \"The idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun violence in America is a blemish on our character as a nation.\" Despite Biden\\'s appeal, there is ferocious opposition to banning powerful weapons like the AR-15, a semi-automatic resembling the US military M16 rifle. It has become notorious as both the tool of choice in many mass shootings and a hugely popular item for sports shooters and legal gun enthusiasts. Biden successfully backed an assault weapons ban in 1994 when he was a senator. The law expired a decade later, however, and has never been renewed, with Republicans increasingly rigid in opposing what they depict as an attack on the more than two centuries-old constitutional right of citizens to have weapons. \"President Biden\\'s executive actions today do two things: appease the far left and infringe upon our Second Amendment right to bear arms,\" Representative Robert Aderholt of Alabama tweeted, echoing the skepticism of numerous Republicans. \"They want to take your guns,\" said another Republican lawmaker, Ohio\\'s Jim Jordan. McCarthy vowed his party would \"strongly oppose and pursue every option - be it legislative or judicial - to protect the right to keep and bear arms.\" In March, after the shooting spree in Colorado, Biden said he wanted Congress to pass \"common sense steps\" to restrict firearms.

That includes\\xa082 people killed in the town of Bago, near Yangon, on Friday, which the AAPP called a \"killing field\". \"The world watches in horror, as the army uses violence against its own people,\" he said. China and Russia both have ties to Myanmar\\'s armed forces, as the largest and second-largest suppliers of weapons to the country, respectively. The United Nations\\xa0Security Council last week called for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and others detained by the military, but stopped short of condemning the coup. The EU is preparing fresh sanctions on individuals, as well as companies owned by the Myanmar military. The bloc in March agreed on a first set of sanctions on 11 individuals linked to the coup, including the commander-in-chief of the military. While EU economic leverage in the country is relatively small, Borrell said the EU could offer to increase its economic ties with Myanmar if democracy is restored. That could include more trade and investments in sustainable development, he said. EU foreign direct investment in Myanmar totalled US$700 million in 2019, compared with US$19 billion from China. The military says it staged the coup because an election won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party last November\\xa0was rigged. The election commission has dismissed the assertion.

Though the lockdown had shuttered onsite operations for most learning organisations, it opened new avenues for the digital ones with 94 per cent saying they have considered learning a new skill during this period to leverage extra time at home that will solidify their resume to sail through the new normal, according to the IP-driven incubation lab, BridgeLabz, survey. The survey is based on online interviews of over 1,100 engineering graduates during August 10-14 across the country. BridgeLabz was set up to bridge the skill-gap among the existing talent pool of engineers by making them job-ready through experiential learning and focused mentorship. Digitisation has emerged as the fourth industrial revolution enabling continuous learning and remote working and is on the verge to redefine the role of upskilling in future-proofing aspirants against market downturns. A majority of students side with the online medium for its ability to provide quick answers and convenience of access when it comes to preferential mode of learning, the survey revealed. About 42 per cent of freshers find live sessions with mentors best for on-the-spot query resolution, while 21 per cent find offline classroom-based training to be a viable learning option. The survey revealed that the trend can be accredited to the experiential learning model and upskilling programmes that allow learners to seek live help from industry experts while they hone their skills leveraging online platforms. About 37 per cent prefer recorded classes for their ease of accessibility from anywhere, anytime while offline mode has least takers as only 21 per cent choose an offline classroom-based learning model, it added. The digital disruption is not only affecting the learning preferences but also the working landscape, the survey opined. A whopping 72 per cent of users want to work remotely as opposed to 28 per cent who wish to work from the office, it found. Besides, the engineering graduates seek more stability with their job profiles owing to the current volatility in the employment market, the survey revealed. When asked about the kind of job roles, 90 per cent of the respondents said they prefer a regular, full-time job. Part-time jobs are no longer popular with coders any more, with only 10 per cent of coders saying they might opt for a freelancing job amidst the current “It is good to see that coders are utilising their time at home to develop new skills. This will eventually help them stand out from the rest of the crowd who don’t possess the talent critical for the new normal.

Diwali, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Eid, Christmas, and Kumbh Mela, the mother of all festivals, are clearly not enough. We probably have the most literary festivals in the world. Other countries have run-of-the-mill elections. India, and \\xa0has a “festival of democracy” Therefore it’s hardly surprising that in the middle of the second wave of , the prime minister wants the good citizens of India to have themselves a or a vaccination festival. In his speech, Narendra Modi suggested that a between 11 and 14 April could boost the vaccination drive. Also, 11 April happens to be the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotiba Phule while 14 April is that of Babasaheb Ambedkar. This could be some strategist’s brainwave of killing two birds with one jab. One year ago as India went into lockdown the prime minister had other festive ideas to raise our spirits - we clanged pots and pans, blew conch shells, lit divas. There were even WhatsApp forwards about how that vibration was going to destroy the virus. One year later the virus is rampaging through the country in its second wave, those WhatsApp forwarders have move on to other causes and we have upped the game from pots and pans and candles to a full-fledged festival. Cynics might roll their eyes but the\\xa0prime minister knows that as soon as it’s called a festival it becomes a red-letter day in our minds. Amazon and Flipkart can do “Tika Utsav” bumper sales starting on 12:01\\xa0am on 11 April until 11:59\\xa0pm on 14 April. Pizza Hut can deliver Tika Utsav special pizzas - with tika kebab toppings of course. Each city can have friendly contests to see which centre doles out the most shots in one day, that’s vaccine shots, not alcoholic ones. Anything that encourages vaccination is of course something to be encouraged. And the prime minister is in his own way a cheerleader-in-chief for the nation. Thus he is to be commended for trying to encourage all eligible Indians to go out and get vaccinated. And if some upbeat festival messaging works better than doom-and-gloom portents so be it. Of course, there is a danger that in the rush to celebrate tika utsavs, we could crowd vaccination centres and forget about social distancing but that’s a minor quibble. But what feels incongruous is this cheery PSA for a “festival of vaccination” occurs at the same time as a “festival of democracy” is unfolding in so many states across India. The pandemic and the election seem to be occurring in different worlds, hermetically sealed from each other. There are two Indias, one in which a second wave is raging and one in which elections are happening and apparently never the twain shall meet. Mind you this is a country where a court rules that you can be fined for not wearing your mask while alone in your car. A vehicle is a “public place” says the Delhi High Court but a political rally is obviously not. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan recently scolded his fellow citizens for letting down their guard and allowing the Covid numbers to explode afresh. He blamed “lack of commitment and sincerity” and said, “nobody is interested in wearing the mask.. there’s no respect for the norms of physical distancing.” , the same minister shared pictures of his party leaders holding election rallies where hardly anyone was wearing a mask and there was certainly no physical distancing happening. “One look at Harsh Vardhan’s Twitter feed makes it quite clear who could be called out “for taking everything casually’” writes Rohan Venkataramakrishnan in . It’s not a BJP problem. It’s a problem pretty much across the political spectrum. Old habits die hard. Old electioneering habits die especially hard.

Perhaps the fact that the Bihar elections did not cause a huge explosion in infections lulled us into a false sense of complacency. But these elections are happening in the middle of a certified second wave. Yet the same politicians who wag their fingers at the public for giving safety precautions a “tilanjali” seem to have no interest in leading by example. And they do not even see the jarring dissonance. It is obviously not easy in a country like India to do physical distancing at the best of times, let alone at election time. But we can do our bit. The symbolism matters. Though Donald Trump sneered at Joe Biden for wearing a mask during his campaign, Biden resolutely stuck to it. The open-air inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with the guests wearing masks sent out two messages - one, that the business of democracy and transition of power must go one and two, they must go on with as much safety precautions as possible in these grave times. It was about fortitude in face of a pandemic not the denial of it. It will never be foolproof but the message is important. The visual of masked politicians on stage at an election rally in India would send out a message as well. A top political leader taking his mask off to address the rally and then putting it back on would send out a message. Similarly, a crowded stage filled with maskless jostling politicians sends out its own message to the rank and file. A political candidate in Kolkata told reporters asking him about lack of masks and safety norms that he was “not afraid” of the virus and he would win, Covid or no Covid. Tirath Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand tells devotees planning to attend Mahakumbh that “nobody will be stopped in the name of ” because “faith is stronger than fear”. Two days later he tested positive. At this point it’s baffling that politicians still think bravado is the vaccine we all need. Now the Haridwar district magistrate has said all schools in the district will remain closed from 9 to 15 April not because of fears but “in view of a huge rush of devotees to Kumbh Mela.” It’s clear that after a year everyone is suffering from Covid safety exhaustion. The masks are slipping and weddings and parties are back and public transport is crowded. We read about rising numbers and lack of beds but there’s no indication that it’s affecting our behaviour. A video of a cheerful woman at a temple during Holi telling a reporter there was no Covid there recently went viral. Despite Yogi Adityanath’s strongman reputation in Uttar Pradesh, his exhortation to maintain safety protocols during Holi seemed to fall on many deaf ears. People are tired of a year of safety protocols or lulled by the dip in numbers at the end of 2020 or both. But now that the second wave has truly landed, mixed messages from the political leaders do not help. While the PM exhorts us to not let down our guard, we just hear \"no lockdown\". The prime minister in his message about the second wave has reiterated the focus needs to be on “test, track, treat, Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid management”. That’s commendable. But perhaps the time has come for politicians of all parties, not just the aam aadmi, to also exhibit that “Covid-appropriate behaviour”.

text='WASHINGTON DC: The last time the US budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product was in double digits for more than a year was during World War II. Joe Biden was just an infant. Few had heard of Harry Truman. As Biden approaches his first 100 days as president, the sheer size of his throw of the dice is starting to sink in.\\xa0 As a share of the US economy, Biden’s fiscal expansion is many times larger than Lyndon Johnson’s “guns and butter” spending, which ushered in the nation’s most recent era of high inflation. Nobody can be sure whether Biden’s roughly US$5 trillion in new spending will lead to runaway inflation. Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, puts the risk of inflation at about a third. He gives the same odds to the prospect that America will continue to enjoy non-inflationary growth. For what it is worth, the US bond market’s inflation expectations have leapt in the past few weeks. But neither the bond markets nor most economists foresaw the era of inflation that began in the late 1960s or the “great moderation” that replaced it in the 1980s. The fact that Biden is taking a risk is not in doubt. It is the composition of his gamble that is open to question. Biden put most of his fiscal chips on the US$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed last month. That was a stimulative bill for an economy that did not need much more aggregate demand. It came on top of more than US$3 trillion of stimulus last year. By comparison, his proposed US$2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, better known as the infrastructure bill, which he proposed last week, is small. The spending, at least half of which has little to do with infrastructure, will be spread out over eight years, which means it will add less than US$300 billion a year in federal investments. Given that Biden’s “build back better” plan was the centrepiece of his campaign, the end result is surprisingly modest. Which leads to the odd situation where both the centrist Summers and the socialist Bernie Sanders are saying almost the same thing. Sanders believes Biden’s infrastructure bill is far too small. Summers believes the stimulus was far too big. Both may be right at the same time. It is worth stressing that investment spending is less inflationary than stimulus as, in principle, it boosts long-term productivity growth. What is the political risk? Biden’s logic was that it was better to make the first bill as large as possible as he may not get a second chance. That may turn out to be true. It is still unclear what price moderate Democrats, such as Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, will demand for supporting his infrastructure bill. The deal could unravel over the proposed corporate tax increases that would partly fund it. It could also come unstuck over demands that state income tax rebates be restored to wealthy taxpayers in Democratic states such as New York (Donald Trump removed most of them in his 2017 tax bill). Even without the tax increases, Republicans would probably unanimously oppose it. The plan includes US$80 billion in extra funding for Amtrak, the US rail system, which conservatives revile as a form of socialist transport. To give a sense of its size, that sum is roughly a third higher than Britain’s annual defence budget. The bill, nevertheless, would go a long way to correcting decades of under-investment in US roads, bridges, broadband and public housing. Biden’s expected US$1 trillion to US$2 trillion “caring economy” bill, which he is expected to unveil soon, would also make education and worker training more affordable, and would bring US parental leave rights into line with other wealthy nations. All of which is badly needed. None of which will necessarily happen. The risk is that Biden is over-interpreting the times. The pandemic has undoubtedly changed the political weather in the US. It helped defeat Trump. But did coronavirus herald what many observers insist is the demise of neoliberalism? That remains to be seen. If Biden has overshot and the US Federal Reserve is forced to apply the brakes to control inflation, or new spending leads to a string of white elephant projects that lessen trust in government, Republicans would reap the downside. In which case Biden’s new era could turn into a one-term blip. His gamble is noble and could pay off.

The penalty, equivalent to around 4 per cent\\xa0of Alibaba\\'s revenues in 2019, comes amid an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on the home-grown technology conglomerates in the last few months that have weighed on company shares. Alibaba\\'s billionaire founder Jack Ma\\'s business empire has been particularly put under intense scrutiny after his stinging criticism of China\\'s regulatory system in late October. In late December, China\\'s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced it launched an anti-trust probe into the company. That came after authorities halted a planned US$37 billion IPO from Ant Group, Alibaba\\'s Internet finance arm. SAMR said on Saturday that after an investigation launched in December, it had determined that Alibaba had been \"abusing market dominance\" since 2015 by preventing its merchants from using other online e-commerce platforms. It said the practice violates China\\'s anti-monopoly law by hindering the free circulation of goods and infringing on the business interests of merchants. The SAMR ordered Alibaba to make \"thorough rectifications\" to strengthen internal compliance and protect consumer rights. \"This penalty will be viewed as a closure to the anti-monopoly case for now by the market. It\\'s indeed the highest profile anti-monopoly case in China,\" said Hong Hao, head of research BOCOM International in Hong Kong. \"The market has been anticipating some sort of penalty for some time ... but people need to pay attention to the measures beyond the anti-monopoly investigation, such as the divestment of media assets.\" Alibaba said in a statement posted on its official Weibo account that it \"accepted\" the decision and would resolutely implement SAMR\\'s rulings. It said it would also work to improve corporate compliance. The Chinese e-commerce giant said it will hold a conference call on Monday to discuss the penalty decision. Alibaba had come under fire in the past from rivals and sellers for allegedly forbidding its merchants from listing on other e-commerce platforms. The practice of preventing merchants from listing on rival platforms is a long-standing one, and the regulator spelt out in rules issued in February that it was illegal. \"The fine bill is a milestone and road sign with great importance,\" Shi Jianzhong, antitrust consultant committee member of the State Council and professor of China University of Political Science and Law, wrote in state-backed Economic Times. \"It indicates that the antitrust law enforcement on internet platforms has entered a new era, and released clear policy signal.\"', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2821, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='9cb7a81a-1b32-4a66-82a8-6301cc776abf', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'Business', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/aramco-agrees-us-12-4-billion-deal-sell-stake-in-pipelines-14599450', 'title': 'Aramco agrees to US$12.4 billion deal to sell stake in pipelines', 'published_date': '11 Apr 2021 07:55AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='b7bc4b6d-df47-4f41-972f-c98a009c6046', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'Business', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/aramco-agrees-us-12-4-billion-deal-sell-stake-in-pipelines-14599450', 'title': 'Aramco agrees to US$12.4 billion deal to sell stake in pipelines', 'published_date': '11 Apr 2021 07:55AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, hash='f06dcd7d3b358bafe9a6e61ca060a9a54f8670554fd9ea411ba5f149d1d4d0da'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='494e12a3-0885-492c-b065-4be19037c7ef', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'Business', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/china-fines-alibaba-record-billion-anti-monopoly-violations-14594388', 'title': 'China fines Alibaba record US$2.75 billion for anti-monopoly violations', 'published_date': '10 Apr 2021 10:55AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, hash='d94e7a417e90a2e709485364ee3069cc6ac361e1b53e15d3783e8621e26711c1'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='dfea2370-9043-437b-b498-5312c3c5577c', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='4bbe1c4bc0a89245a9b513dc925439fd65ad7a237bb4e6f78f3e0f171db2493f')}, text='DUBAI: Saudi oil producer Aramco has agreed to a US$12.4 billion deal to sell a 49 per cent\\xa0stake in its pipelines to a consortium led by US-based EIG Global Energy Partners.

In the order passed by a bench headed by the Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, which runs into six pages, not a single paragraph takes into account that allowing for such a mass deportation, will push hundreds of Rohingya refugees back to a land where they face imminent persecution and violence. The principle of non-refoulement in international law states that a person seeking asylum cannot be sent back to a place where s/he faces risk of persecution. It is widely accepted, that the principle of non-refoulement has the status of , which makes it binding on all states regardless of whether they are signatories to the Refugee Convention or not. In the present order, the Supreme Court accepted the central government’s argument that the principle of non-refoulement is not binding on India as it is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention. So it seems the Supreme Court completely overlooked existing jurisprudence which supports the claim that the principle of non-refoulement forms a part of Article 21 of the Constitution. In the order, the court says that “national courts can draw upon international conventions/treaties, so long as they are not in conflict with municipal law.\" However, it stopped right there. In India, there is no law that clearly prohibits the application of non-refoulment. Therefore, the court could’ve “drawn inspiration” from various international conventions, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), which espouse the principle of non-refoulement. The Supreme Court’s refusal to comment on the situation in Myanmar underpins the injustice served in allowing deportation of Rohingya refugees. The petitioners were not against deportation, they just did not want to be sent back to a country where they face an imminent threat of persecution. Therefore, by refusing to comment on the situation in Myanmar the Supreme Court completely negated the petitioners\\' primary reason for approaching the court. The Supreme Court has reasoned that the issue of deportation in the present case does not fall under Article 21 (right to life and liberty), but under Article 19(1)(e) (to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India). This reasoning is flawed for two reasons: a. The case of the petitioners is not about seeking a complete prohibition on deportation to any state. They just did not want to be deported to Myanmar, where they face an imminent threat of persecution. Therefore, the petitioners did not claim a right to reside or settle in any part of India, but simply protection of their right to life. b. In the landmark case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, the Supreme Court had clearly observed that the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution form a “golden triangle” and cannot be interpreted disjunctively. The 6-page long judgment of the Supreme Court in the present case seems to be based more on unfounded rhetoric peddled by the central government than on a reasoned assessment of human rights. When a court of law relies on rhetorical claims instead of evidence on record for making a judgment, it amounts to a gross “miscarriage of justice”. It is unbecoming of a constitutional court to shy away from adequately addressing the concerns of those seeking protection of their right to life. The least a court of such a stature should’ve done is to give reasoning that is not flawed, that is not contrary to its own jurisprudence, and which privileges due process over prejudicial rhetoric. The Supreme Court’s decision to allow deportation of Rohingya refugees to a country where they face threat of persecution raises more serious questions than the answers it purports to provide.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3963, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='5c2d5645-7c63-4828-b3d7-0e5854c2ba97', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.thequint.com', 'section': 'IRCTC', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.thequint.com/lifestyle/travel/irctc-is-offering-tour-package-blissful-tirupati-for-rs-14200', 'title': 'IRCTC Is Offering Tour Package ‘Blissful Tirupati’ for Rs 14,200', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4c1acbec-b307-46fc-8621-77032d7c6740', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.thequint.com', 'section': 'IRCTC', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.thequint.com/lifestyle/travel/irctc-is-offering-tour-package-blissful-tirupati-for-rs-14200', 'title': 'IRCTC Is Offering Tour Package ‘Blissful Tirupati’ for Rs 14,200', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='2c9191a48a31a958d867b3ccab9e1f13bdaf30a221f932407c684a9eb0869b65'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='dfea2370-9043-437b-b498-5312c3c5577c', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.thequint.com', 'section': 'Law', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.thequint.com/news/law/when-rhetorics-trumps-rights', 'title': 'Rhetoric Over Rights: SC Deportation Order Hurts Rohingya Refugees', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='2d5240cffa7703bb9beae341071bdb1a25c8b3b97f1ca6f4c6edbc53d75fad49'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='22508651-d1de-470d-9093-7833c4051e79', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='25821c6f00dd1c5864e0cf20893298f022266f9b36267acd730cbb2468f7dbbf')}, text='Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) is offering a special tour package of Tirupati.

Amidst a national lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or \\x93non-immigrant\\x94 visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery. \\xa0 On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American's lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US. Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31. He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. \\xa0 The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country. No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday mid-night, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House will not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday. \\xa0 Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban. \\x93I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today,\\x94 Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden. \\x93The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work \\x96 and millions more desperate to make ends meet \\x96 now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources,\\x94 he wrote. \\xa0 In his letter, Hawley wrote that the unemployment rate remains at 6.2 per cent \\x96 with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis \\x96 and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions, he said. In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said. \\x93What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers. \\xa0 \\x93I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programmes to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm,\\x94 Hawley added.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3778, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='848ebfca-a64f-4083-b4b3-bc7e55d50aac', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/040321/its-good-bye-for-mumbais-iconic-karachi-bakery.html', 'title': \"Its good-bye for Mumbai's iconic Karachi Bakery\", 'published_date': 'Mar 5, 2021, 4:20 am IST', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='1a3183d3-ade7-4030-893d-fad426a67c79', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/040321/its-good-bye-for-mumbais-iconic-karachi-bakery.html', 'title': \"Its good-bye for Mumbai's iconic Karachi Bakery\", 'published_date': 'Mar 5, 2021, 4:20 am IST', 'language': ''}, hash='c1b09a1996dd942f529ce08e309d0c8cd3831cccaacffd25cda57d8afbf18220'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='b081a52e-e69e-42f2-828b-7c2452d9df99', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/america/010421/indian-it-professionals-to-benefit-as-biden-lets-trump-era-h-1b-visa-b.html', 'title': 'Indian IT professionals to benefit as Biden lets Trump era H-1B visa bans expire', 'published_date': 'Apr 1, 2021, 10:59 am IST', 'language': ''}, hash='11cdcc867ff7fd62d027509a48a3d0b7092cb16c37acc45eb5423487ebd669a3'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='df5ea87d-55e3-4e58-b9a4-41893c9550ef', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='7b3994752498dfaf0e65714c764e26b248d4281119689cd98c19bdfd022b8117')}, text='; Karachi Bakery, the city’s iconic biscuit-maker, has shut its store in Mumbai.

The Ramnani family, which migrated to India during partition, and set up the bakery, originally belonged to Karachi. However, the MNS would not hear anything of the emotional ties the family had with a city it left behind even as later generations of the Ramnanis began running the business. And the claims that it was \\'successful\\' in its campaign against Karachi Bakery, soon followed with MNS leader Haji Saif Shaikh, who led the stir, taking credit on Twitter for the closure of the bakery in Mumbai. \\xa0 \"Nothing could be farther from the truth,\" Rajesh Ramnani told here on Thursday. \"The lease period was over and it could not be renewed due to cost factors. There is no other reason for Karachi Bakery closing its operations in Mumbai. We will continue looking for appropriate premises, and when it is found, we are willing to reopen there,\" Ramnani said. Though the MNS leader tweeted about Karachi Bakery\\'s closure in Mumbai, there were several others from that city who mourned the shutting down.

As chairman of the Telangana Joint Action Committee, he coordinated with all political parties and employees unions and in the fight for statehood. Another leader, Cheruku Sudhakar, was booked under Preventive Detention Act and sent to jail for his active participation in the Telangana movement.

Ruling TRS and opposition Congress and BJP are going all out campaigning in the two constituencies of Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahbubnagar and Khammam-Warangal-Nalgonda constituencies.

The Congress is attacking both the state and Union governments for their alleged failure on various fronts. The BJP is attacking the ruling party on the unemployment front. \\xa0 Senior leaders of political parties are worried over covering the huge area, with the graduate constituencies covering almost 75 per cent of the state.

The ruling TMC has embraced it as its main poll plank to counter the rise of the BJP\\'s Hindutva narrative in the state. \\xa0 It has branded BJP as a \"party of outsiders\" and has fanned the \\'Bengali pride\\' by coming up with a poll slogan \"Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chai\" (Bengal wants its own daughter) creating a poll narrative of sub-nationalism to counter the saffron party\\'s identity politics. The electoral discourse in Bengal, where poll battles are fought on ideological lines, had in the past mostly steered clear of sub-nationalism like identity politics. \"This is for the first time we have made Bengali pride our main poll plank. Bengali pride is not just about Bengalis; it appeals to all sons of the soil,\" senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy told PTI. \\xa0 Another senior TMC leader said \"divisive politics and religious polarisation can be countered with sub-nationalism and regionalism.\" BJP has blamed Trinamool Congress for bringing up the issue of Bengali pride saying it is harping on nationalism, development and identity politics as it senses defeat in its citadel. \"BJP is in power in so many states, but we have never tried to impose any language or culture. This is a baseless allegation as TMC has nothing to showcase to seek votes,\" BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said. \\xa0 BJP national president J P Nadda claimed at various poll rallies that only BJP can restore the Bengali pride and that \"TMC represents everything that is opposite to it\". To counter the narrative and project itself as a party in sync with Bengali culture and ethos, BJP has propped up Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee as its icon. It has also been observing the anniversaries of Bengali icons Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Parties cutting across political lines feel that the issue has its pitfalls and will have a cascading effect on the federal structure in the days to come. \\xa0 They agree that sub-nationalism can no longer be ignored in Bengal as it is reflective of the state\\'s socio- political history which has always preferred opposing or challenging the party at the Centre or a bigger political force and have refused submission. Born out of the Congress on January 1, 1998, TMC had adopted the evocative slogan \\'Maa Mati Manush\\' (Mother, Land and People) carefully blending socialism and secularism that countered the then communists and their doctrines. The rise of BJP in Bengal\\'s political map made TMC realise that its socialist slogan was not enough to offset \\'Hindutva\\', especially when it has been branded by the saffron camp as a party that favours only minorities. \\xa0 It then came up with the narrative of Bengali pride and insider versus outsider debate and has it as its main poll and ideological planks. The desecration of the bust of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar during a BJP procession in the last phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, followed by the publication of the final NRC list in Assam in August that year gave TMC a golden opportunity to brand BJP as an \"anti-Bengali\" party. The NRC list had left out the names of 19 lakh people in Assam, many of them Bengalis. The state BJP\\'s over-dependence on the party\\'s central leadership with leaders from other states calling the shots have not helped matters for the saffron party. It has in fact further fuelled the \"insider versus outsider\" debate. \\xa0 BJP national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya feels that TMC is only interested in winning the votes and has nothing to do with Bengali pride. \"These are gimmicks to win the election.

To woo the Bengali voters, the saffron party in its poll manifesto promised Tagore Smriti Puraskar on the lines of the Nobel prize to honour globally recognised talents and the Satyajit Ray Award on the lines of the Oscar award. It also promised a Gurudev Centre for Cultural Excellence and a film city was promised named after matinee idol Uttam Kumar. \\xa0 TMC has blamed the ascent of BJP in Bengal\\'s political sphere and the increased activities of far-right Hindu outfits which are more in sync with north Indian culture for the politicisation of ethnic sentiments in the state. But a quick look at post-Idependence Bengal\\'s socio- political history shows how Bengali sub-nationalism has always played a role before going dormant in the past few decades. The effect of sub-nationalism in the state was first felt when Congress led by the then chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy in the mid-fifties lost the election to nine municipalities and an assembly by-poll on the issue of merger of West Bengal and Bihar. \\xa0 The Left Front and Praja Socialist Party had then opposed it tooth and nail stating that Bengalis would beome a minority post the merger. Till the mid \\'90S the issue of Bengali pride was not overtly brought into play, as both the mainstream political parties - the Congress ande CPI(M) had several homegrown stalwarts. There were leaders like Jyoti Basu, Bhupesh Gupta, Indrajit Gupta from the Left and Siddartha Sankar Ray, Pranab Mukherjee, A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury from the Congress. However, the CPI(M), which over the years has moulded itself as a party of the Bengali bhadralok (gentleman) through its anti-Congress and anti-Centre stance, smacked of subtle sub-nationalism by often citing \\'Centre\\'s oppression against Bengal\\'. \\xa0 Noted Historian Sugata Bose contends that sub- nationalism was always in the play in Bengal politics in a covert manner. \"The issue of Bengali sub-nationalism was there in post-Independence Bengal, though in a very subtle way. It was never a major rallying point. The Left\\'s constant attack on the Centre and Congress alleging step-motherly treatment towards Bengal was aimed in that direction. \"But after the formation of TMC in 1998, Bengali sub-nationalism was never an issue as the party and the Bengal CPI-M which it defeated were regional players,\" Bose, the Gardiner Professor of Oceanic history at Harvard University, told PTI. \\xa0 \"It is now back as a major poll issue as TMC, a regional party is fighting against BJP, a national party. It has gained momentum as BJP does not have strong homegrown leaders in Bengal and is overdependent on central leaders,\" he said. Several outfits like Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha have emerged in the state\\'s political landscape and they have accused the saffron camp of trying to \"impose Hindi and north Indian culture\" on Bengal. \"The way Bengalis are demographically threatened by non-Bengalis, the day is not far when they will turn into a minority in their own land. This will not only be just in terms of population but also culturally. We are happy that Bengali sub-nationalism has emerged as a rallying point in this polls,\" Kaushik Maiti, a senior leader of Bangla Pokkho, told PTI. \\xa0 These outfits have been raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state. The narrative has its drawbacks as it alienates the Hindi-speaking population, who are a deciding factor in at least 30 of the state\\'s 294 Assembly seats. Sensing this, the TMC has tied up with the RJD and Samajwadi Party for the assembly polls. The two parties have offered unconditional support to it and will campaign for TMC in the Hindi-speaking belts of the state. Political analyst Suman Bhattacharya feels that Bengali sub-nationalism will play an important role in the assembly poll and will be a deciding factor in several seats. \\xa0 \"It had never played such a major role in the polls.', start_char_idx=3765, end_char_idx=7782, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='8d15592c-a586-4a5e-8360-c12d4b6bd736', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='eecd700e-cd16-4e13-a065-464b3afcaf0f', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='d186dba99b86298d310c0383817570de379967347a07a63c03459dc3bfebb0cb'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='990db632-0022-4c4d-96d6-083457ef6a5f', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='27fd84cb5c71a265374946eb3564b8b4d6a4320a9edb513b96b9365602476956'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='8afb9d09-c281-4495-b084-52d992afdb67', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='cc5384e2e2632bf53e98f475683268e86b01042a7272845f42fc03e430c56837')}, text='\"It had never played such a major role in the polls.

Kenya bought $23.2 million worth of frozen fish from China in 2018, according to the International Trade Center, almost all of its fish imports. Fishermen have long complained that the cheap imports were strangling local trade. The coronavirus has slowed Chinese imports. Nervous customers have turned to local fish. But Kenya will soon face shortages unless imports from China resume; it produces just over a third of what it consumes. \\xa0 Kenyan fishermen like 38-year-old Maurice Misodhi, whose skin has been weathered by the sun and wind during two decades on the water, have had a bumper month. Based at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, customers want every fish he catches. Misodhi says the Chinese lockdown seemed to have dried up imports of cheaper Chinese fish. \"As fishermen we can now smile, not because people are suffering from coronavirus, but because we can now sell our fish, and at a good price,\" he said. The price of a kilo of Nile perch - 250 shillings ($2.50) a month ago - has shot up to 350 shillings. Fish trader Mary Didi usually buys from Chinese suppliers but has now turned to Misodhi. \"The supply at the Chinese importers has gone down, and many of my customers were also scared of the Chinese fish, thinking they would contract the virus,\" she said. \"To keep the business running, I had to turn to fish from the lake.\" Bob Otieno, chairman of Dunga Beach Management Unit, says sales have shot up. The beach registers a catch of between 1 and 1.5 tonnes of fish each day and sales have gone up from 50% of the catch to 90% in the last two weeks. Previously, fishermen would eat, barter or give away around half their catch. \"We used to have many fishermen sell their catch at low prices because of competition from the Chinese fish,\" he said. Kenya produces 180,000 tonnes per year but consumes about 500,000 tonnes, according to 2019 government figures. Christine Adhiambo, the government\\'s assistant director of fisheries for the lake region, said the two biggest importers of Chinese fish had not shipped from China since November and were running down stocks. Kenya could face shortages soon, she said. \"Kenya cannot satisfy its local fish demand,\" she said. \"That is why we heavily rely on supplements from China.\"', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2428, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='fa885383-1628-45f5-8cfb-2db59cca4596', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/280321/tn-polls-battle-at-royapuram-is-a-matter-of-prestige-for-dmk-and-aiad.html', 'title': 'TN Polls: Battle at Royapuram is a matter of prestige for DMK and AIADMK', 'published_date': 'Mar 28, 2021, 12:41 pm IST', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='20e786b0-3696-4e57-9216-35af9deb5d70', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/280321/tn-polls-battle-at-royapuram-is-a-matter-of-prestige-for-dmk-and-aiad.html', 'title': 'TN Polls: Battle at Royapuram is a matter of prestige for DMK and AIADMK', 'published_date': 'Mar 28, 2021, 12:41 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='a984c4fdc8e386f49aeaf3b86c30bc55ef75da4526108147ad8ab06367bbad48'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='f18effc9-f95a-4222-81e8-1a8a3a291534', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/coronavirus-provides-unexpected-boost-for-kenyan-fishermen-288063', 'title': 'Coronavirus provides unexpected boost for Kenyan fishermen', 'published_date': 'Kisumu, Kenya', 'language': 'en'}, hash='33c8a24a2e6d03ba8fb5e44976f47a41bf44e9b91361374a4cd0a1d2f54aeb8b'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a1b0b81c-d554-4b21-9504-5394b5b52f61', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='0970d1103e34633cd6d24295ea3c45479fc6c60055a92bf3b3315ba3c5b898ca')}, text='The electoral battle for Royapuram, an arterial northern part of the city, has become very prestigious for the opposition DMK, which is desperately attempting to wrest back the seat it lost to AIADMK\\'s D Jayakumar way back in 2001. Elections to 234 Assembly seats in Tamil Nadu will be held on April 6, with counting to be taken up on May 2. \\xa0 Jayakumar, senior AIADMK leader and state fisheries minister, has bulldozed candidates of DMK and its ally Congress in four consecutive elections, made the constituency an AIADMK bastion and established his virtually undisputed supremacy. Jayakumar, also the AIADMK organising secretary, scripted his own success in remaining as the MLA of Royapuram Assembly constituency for a quarter of a century, inflicting humiliating defeats on successive DMK and Congress candidates who challenged him. \"DJ Annan,\" (elder brother) as he is affectionately called by his supporters in his constituency, had lost only during the 1996 assembly election to DMK\\'s R Mathivanan, when a strong anti-incumbency swept away the then ruling AIADMK in the hustings. \\xa0 He registered his first impressive win in the 1991 election, trouncing Mathivanan and maintained his winning streak in elections in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. His different campaign styles continue to draw crowds and the ever smiling former Assembly Speaker does not hesitate to wear the white cap similar to that worn by party founder and late chief minister M G Ramachandran, or sing a popular number from \"Puratchi Thalaivar\\'s\" films, to connect with the people. Ramachandran is addressed as \\'Puratchi Thalaivar,\\' meaning revolutionary leader. \\xa0 Jayakumar even sprang a surprise recently by playing kabaddi with the youth on his way home after winding up the day\\'s hectic election campaign. His unparalleled popularity is something that cannot be underestimated, but rival DMK insists a change is required. \"It is time for change, the time for the Rising Sun (DMK symbol) under the leadership M K Stalin to emerge,\" has been the constant refrain of the party\\'s 54-year old candidate R Murthy\\'s election campaign. He is the proprietor of iDream Cinemas and iDream properties. \\xa0 But Jayakumar, contesting for the seventh time from his home turf, is confident of emerging victorious this time too. Despite its mixed bag of communities, traffic woes of residents of Royapuram assembly constituency have not ended. Fishermen, who play a major role in tilting the scales, are apprehensive of the multi-crore developmental programmes in the coastal villages as these threaten their livelihood opportunities. \"DMK\\'s assurance for a sea bridge project connecting Chennai Port-Thiruvottriyur to eliminate traffic congestion and fasten commercial access to and out of the port is not needed. This will only corrode the livelihood opportunities of the fisher folk,\" says Bharathi Ku, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association (SIFWA). \\xa0 \"What we need is livelihood protection initiatives, not multi-crore projects that eat into our villages,\" he argues. The fishermen are also opposed to establishing desalination plants in the coastal villages. \"The ever increasing population and floating population of at least 50,000 people on an average per day into Royapuram for trading and other activities makes this constituency prone to frequent traffic snarls,besides taxing existing resources,\" 60-year old Jayakumar, who hails from the fishing community, told P T I. \\xa0 Despite being a small area, the density of population is high and streets are narrow in Royapuram. Not less than 3,500 autos make sorties into Royapuram on any given day, Jayakumar, who is also an advocate, claims. \"So this calls for implementing a master plan to meet the increasing requirements of the people.

Human Rights Watch and Belady: An Island for Humanity in report which was released today claim that the legal system ignored the abuse. The report titled “No one cared he was a child: Egyptian Security Forces’ Abuse of Children in Detention” claims 20 children aged 12-17 were arrested and abused by forces. “The harrowing accounts of these children and their families reveal how Egypt’s machinery of repression has subjected children to grave abuses,” said Aya Hijazi, co-director of Belady.\\xa0 “Egyptian authorities act as though they are above all laws when it comes to children in detention”, Hijazi added. Based on the account mentioned on the Human Rights Watch website, 15 out of 20 children claim to have been tortured during interrogation. A child was also badly assaulted during the process. As many as seven children claim that they were tortured using sophisticated electricity driven tools like stun guns. “Egyptian authorities act as though they are above all laws when it comes to children in detention”, Hijazi added. Many children were tied with arms behind their backs which led to the dislocation of their shoulders. A 14-year-old boy claimed that his joints had be put back into place with manipulation from another prison, who is allegedly a doctor. Many human rights abuses have been reported under the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Even though most abuse was allegedly committed by the National Security Agency’s officers, the police and army have also been complicit. \\xa0 “Children are describing being waterboarded and electrocuted on their tongues and genitals, and yet Egypt’s security forces are facing no consequences,” said Bill Van Esveld, associate children’s rights director at Human Rights Watch.\\xa0 Many human rights abuses have been reported under the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Even though most abuse was allegedly committed by the National Security Agency’s officers, the police and army have also been complicit. “Governments that want to end these horrors should end support to Egyptian security services and condition any future agreements on there being real reforms”, Esveld added. Even though children were put into detention, their families were not informed. Many of them were missing in action for over 13 months.\\xa0 A child was given the death sentence, which is in direct violation of international human rights protocols in place. Additionally, three were indefinitely put in solitary confinement. When families tried to reach out to their kids, their requests were denied. Many narratives claim that there was not enough room for everybody to sleep, owing to which most kids slept in shifts. A harrowing account released by Human Rights Watch suggests that kids were threatened were re-detention if they didn’t confess to the crime they were being held for. According to Egyptian law, all detainees have to be presented in front of a prosecutor within 24 hours of taking them into custody. However, the authorities circumvented this law by claiming that the kids were “arrested”. The law states that children cannot be tried before criminal courts, however, two kids were tried in military courts, which clearly disregards the law in place. Under the 1996 Child Law and the subsequent amendments, special protection is accorded to children, and they cannot be detained and penalised along the same lines as adults. A loophole in the Child Law enables officers to send children to criminal courts if their accomplices were adults, which is abused to prosecute children. According to the human rights group, the allies of Egypt, including the US and many European countries need to end their support to the country in order for them to be held accountable for their trespassing.

According to Tete provincial director of health, Carla Mosse, the immigration service had halted the lorry in the African town of Moatize, the BBC reported. Even though a thorough investigation will be conducted to understand what happened to the victims, suffocation is the most likely scenario. As reported by many media outlets, the driver was hesitant to stop the vehicle. This sentiment was echoed by Amelia Direito, a spokesperson for the National Migration Service in Tete. \\xa0 Direito had heard noises coming from inside of the lorry, which raised suspicion. After this, the lorry was stopped and inspected. According to the information received by a Portuguese newspaper called Observador, the survivors were banging the container and screaming for help when they were found by authorities. In October 2019, 39 bodies were discovered in a lorry in the United Kingdom. Police in the UK had claimed that the bodies found in a in Essex were from Vietnam. The Essex police worked with Vietnamese police officials to verify the identity of\\xa0 39 people discovered at Grays in Essex on October 23. The lorry trailer was travelling from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Grays, Essex.

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.\\xa0 At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.\\xa0 Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company.

They aspire to take the less explored local weaving art to a global stage. “Our country is rich in fabrics, weaving techniques, designs, prints, and all handicraft.

Unfortunately, the weavers do not always get the benefit of the same. Through Beatitude, we want to bridge this gap and ensure that the weavers have ample work to sustain their craft and be paid accordingly,” says Pushkar. Talking about the company’s remarkable growth in the last five years, Akanksha said, “Our focus has always been the benefit of all in the entire demand and supply chain. We ensure that the company creates value for both – the weavers and the customers. Not just that, we are equally concerned about the benefits of our employees, other suppliers, and vendors. We all are a part of a big family where we work for the betterment of each other. This has helped us grow at an incredible pace”. The company has witnessed an impressive CAGR of 4975% over the past four years. The owners of the company are fiercely motivated and have big plans for expansion in the coming year. They started 2021 by launching an exclusive designer range of theme-based handpainted Organza silk sarees launched under a new collection called “Exclusiva”.

She says there was no widespread fraud and that her own party is attacking her for refusing to “put my thumb on the scale of democracy.” Barbara Cegavske, the only Republican statewide office holder in Nevada, said members of her party are disappointed with the election results and believe fraud occurred “despite a complete lack of evidence to support that belief.” Cegavske, who has overseen elections in the state since 2014, has repeatedly defended the results as reliable and accurate despite attacks from and other Republicans. Nevada is among the states where former President Trump sought to subvert results from the\\xa0 \\xa0and conspiracy theories. President Joe Biden defeated Trump in the Western swing state by 2 percentage points, or nearly 34,000 votes. “Regrettably, members of my own political party have decided to censure me simply because they are disappointed with the outcome of the 2020 election. While I have been loyal to the Nevada Republican Party during my over two decades as an elected official, I have been unwavering in my commitment to oversee elections and administer Nevada’s election laws in a neutral, nonpartisan manner,” Cegavske said in a statement Sunday. “My job is to carry out the duties of my office as enacted by the Nevada Legislature, not carry water for the state GOP or put my thumb on the scale of democracy. Unfortunately, members of my own party continue to believe the 2020 general election was wrought with fraud — and that somehow I had a part in it — despite a complete lack of evidence to support that belief.” A GOP official who was unauthorized to speak publicly confirmed to The Associated Press that the measure passed on a 126-112 vote by the party’s governing members at a meeting in the state capital, Carson City. Jessica Hanson, the executive director of the state GOP, sent a statement from the party noting that the censure vote on Saturday “passed narrowly” and said it occurred following “a healthy debate” over the election. “The Nevada Republican Party holds our elected officials to a high standard. As such, this weekend the party sent a clear message that our officials must work for the people and we demand that our representatives at all levels of government uphold their Oath of Office,” the party said. It wasn’t clear from a copy of the censure resolution what punishment the censure entailed. Hanson did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the punishment. In March, Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald presented four boxes to Cegavske’s office that he and other Republican leaders said contained proof of more than 120,000 instances of voter fraud. But Cegavske\\xa0 \\xa0Election Integrity Violation reports submitted. Her office said a number of those reports were already under investigation by her office and it was reviewing the others reports to determine if an investigation was warranted. The secretary of state allows people to fill out the two-page Election Integrity Violation forms when they believe they have witnessed people breaking election laws, which staff subsequently investigate.

He was 93. Clark, whose father, Tom Clark, was attorney general and U.S. Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his Manhattan home, a family member, Sharon Welch, announced to media outlets After serving in President Lyndon Johnson’s Cabinet in 1967 and ’68, Clark set up a private law practice in New York in which he championed civil rights, fought racism and the death penalty, and represented declared foes of the United States including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. “If you don’t insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others?” he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedy’s Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever — Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Truman’s attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clark’s client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers.

He was 93. Clark, whose father, Tom Clark, was attorney general and U.S. Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his Manhattan home, a family member, Sharon Welch, announced to media outlets After serving in President Lyndon Johnson’s Cabinet in 1967 and ’68, Clark set up a private law practice in New York in which he championed civil rights, fought racism and the death penalty, and represented declared foes of the United States including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. “If you don’t insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others?” he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedy’s Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever — Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Truman’s attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clark’s client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers.

The 57-year-old Black woman from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, feared that her high blood pressure and diabetes might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. Then a member of Pringle’s church, a local NAACP leader who has led a vaccination campaign targeting Black residents, urged her to reconsider. He shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. “That’s what made me change my mind,” said Pringle, who finally agreed to an appointment to get her first shot Thursday. “I had to pray about it. And I felt better after that.” Campaigns aimed at Black communities across the US are making headway in the effort to persuade people that the vaccines are safe and effective. With millions of dollars in assistance from President Joe Biden’s administration, local groups have urged Black Americans to roll up their sleeves for shots and set aside what for some is a shared historical distrust of science and government. A poll by for Public Affairs Research in late March found that about 24 percent of Black American adults said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. That’s down from 41 percent in January. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots in almost the same proportion as white Americans at 26 percent and Hispanic Americans at 22 percent. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken “almost a 180-degree turnaround” as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. He credited Black physicians, faith leaders and other community organisers for being trusted messengers during the pandemic, which has killed more than 5,50,000 Americans. “It’s the messenger and the message,” but the messenger “is probably the most important part of it, and people doing it in a way that wasn’t preachy,” Benjamin said. “They didn’t tell people, ‘You need to get vaccinated because it’s your duty.’ They basically said, ‘Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family.’” Some of the most effective outreach has relied on existing community relationships, such as local physicians talking about their own decisions to get vaccinated, to reassure the public, said Dr Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. Community members in the Baltimore area who knew Cooper from her research on food deserts and nutrition trusted her as a source of information on , she said. Based on that relationship, “people felt comfortable hearing from me,” she said. Some state health departments have rolled out ads targeting communities of color. NAACP chapters in some cities have booked appointments for people to get shots. Pastors of Black churches have urged their parishioners to take the vaccines. In Brunswick, Georgia, the Rev John Perry and another Black pastor put their faces on a billboard promoting the vaccines, and postcards with a similar image were mailed to residents. Both efforts were produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. “I think we still have enough people on the fence that are going to budge and get their shots,” said Perry, who initially wanted to wait a year before getting his shots but changed his mind after reading up on how the vaccines were developed. He got his second dose Wednesday. Jason Pettibone, a Black barber in Perry’s coastal Georgia community, remains hesitant. His parents and sister have all been vaccinated with no ill effects. Yet Pettibone said the stories he hears from customers — including one who swore his father lost all feeling in the right side of his body after getting a shot — have made it hard to overcome his uncertainty. “I’m thinking in my head not only would it be good for me to get it, because I don’t want to get sick myself, but also to protect other people who come into the shop,” Pettibone said. “But it’s the unknown. Everybody’s really scared of the unknown.” In Savannah, Georgia, community activist Natavia Sanders said outreach efforts can backfire with some in the Black community who suspect the government is targeting them as test subjects rather than seeking to protect their health.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4422, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='7401cb31-58d2-4b6a-b96d-5c107f5e4a43', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'health', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/world/amid-skepticism-campaigns-aimed-at-black-americans-across-us-persuade-people-to-take-the-covid-19-vaccine-9516301.html', 'title': 'Amid\\xa0skepticism, campaigns\\xa0aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='fc6ae263-b931-4a0f-bdfb-7484192526ff', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'health', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/world/amid-skepticism-campaigns-aimed-at-black-americans-across-us-persuade-people-to-take-the-covid-19-vaccine-9516301.html', 'title': 'Amid\\xa0skepticism, campaigns\\xa0aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='d181d0ba7006d4f31bf59d653886888c3e9534cd6ff311201e140e39c15dc6fc'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='36c2d347-9859-41e5-8f08-74608fad0e18', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'health', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/world/amid-skepticism-campaigns-aimed-at-black-americans-across-us-persuade-people-to-take-the-covid-19-vaccine-9516301.html', 'title': 'Amid\\xa0skepticism, campaigns\\xa0aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='66c5fde389caa7a63400a74bc18c5713018995a150ce12b74f09f75253a12007'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='2e15ca74-a510-4e89-8896-bc2c3dfb6b88', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='e1878265ea42b9ae2ba0137c778bb6a7e0f7787fde991964eda68c75459b5aa7')}, text='Some of that skepticism can be traced to an infamous study in Tuskegee, Alabama, where the government let hundreds of Black men suffer untreated syphilis for 40 years for research purposes.

Sahen Karamchandani is one of the young Chartered Wealth Manager in India who’s suddenly taken wings and awaken the kings! What he meant was, all the resources in this world won’t make you successful if you don’t have a hunger for planning for your success, especially investing in the financial markets. Sahen was one of the few Economists who had sensed the Blood in the market way before it wounded. Sahen had predicted and cautioned about a crash in the markets through his social media handle with an unrealistic fall of 2600 points target which later turned out to be a reality. (Link: ). Sahen had even predicted a strong rebound and vigorously pushed investors to invest… now we all know how we regret and crave for the march levels again. (Link: ). Growing up, Sahen recalls business channels as screens displaying green and red arrows on which he used to bet on, with his father. He said, “As I grew up, I began learning more about the uses of the financial markets. From my father using financial markets to make his investments, to the companies using these funds for expansion and development. Learning these aspects of Financial markets familiarised me with the sheer amount of power and versatility these markets possessed”. He soon began to find traces of financial markets everywhere that he looked from MNC’s to employees, investment to speculation, DII to FII, saving to economic development; every economic variable relied on financial markets to operate. Claiming to be a turning point in his life, he said, “My friend once told me ‘Yeh Company ke share lele bahut kamayega’ (Buy this share, you will make a lot). At first, I got carried away, but I had my doubts about whether or not it would work. I spent the night researching online and learning more about the suggested company, and by the next morning I realized that this was a dooming opportunity with the business having no future prospects.” I decided to back out on my Investment. Though I was right in the long-run, but my friend did make money in that stock in the short-run… it was that day I understood that the market don’t believe in tit for tat…numbers don’t dictate the stock price…the market sentiment decides. Numbers just tell you which stock to buy, but when to buy is the place where market sentiment walks in. On being asked, What does it take to become a successful wealth manager? He said, “People will say investment strategies, plan, contacts, luck, etc but No…it all comes down to one word ‘Trust’, the trust that I have in my investment suggestion, and the trust that investors have in me. There will be times when things don’t go your way, that’s natural buts that when you have to be there with your investors and face it out… rather than shying away like most of the wealth managers do and losing their trust. NEVER BREAK ANYONE’S TRUST IN LIFE. It takes 30 years to build a reputation and ten minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.” Going forward on the Indian Growth story He said, “I never saw the Indian long-term growth story endangered. Despite, the initial contraction by almost 24% in the first quarter due to covid, we have recovered well to reach the minimal shrink of 7.5% in Quarter 2. Moving ahead, we continue to see huge potential in India in the long run and believe our growth story is intact. And it’s not just I who believe soo… it’s also accepted by others, who are ready to invest in India. We expect the country to witness a ‘V’ shaped recovery post the vaccine roll-out. Sahen Karamchandani, aka the triple ‘M’, not only has fulfilled his childhood dreams but is also helping others achieve theirs with compassion and a positive mental attitude, becoming one of the best wealth consultants in India.\\xa0 To learn more about this inspirational personality, follow his work on social media, and become a part of his large community.

New Zealand Rugby is close to approving plans for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, which will likely involve trans-Tasman matches next year and a New Zealand-based Pacific Islands team from 2022. Teams from New Zealand and Australia haven’t played each other since March when the full Super Rugby competition was abandoned because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2021 season will see a continuation of the successful Super Rugby Aotearoa competition involving home-and-away matches among New Zealand’s five Super Rugby teams, this time with a one-off final added. That tournament might then be followed by a series of crossovers between the New Zealand teams and Australia’s five Super Rugby teams, which likely will have completed their own domestic tournament. The establishment of that competition depends on a cooling of the currently heated relationship between Australian and New Zealand rugby unions. New Zealand Rugby is eager to added a Pacific Island team from 2022, to be based in South Auckland, and has received expressions of interests from several potential team organizations. Introducing that team in 2021 is unlikely because recruitment for next season is already underway and that would place the Pacifika team at a disadvantage. The 2022 Super Rugby tournament would comprise a minimum of eight teams, including the Pacific team. Several expressions of interests have been received from teams eager to participate and the tournament might be larger. The New Zealand Herald newspaper has reported bids from teams based in Fiji and Hong Kong are among those being considered. New Zealand Rugby is likely to decide the new tournament size and formats by late November. It’s aim is to find a sustainable and commercially successful Super Rugby tournament, even if the coronavirus continues to impact international travel. The 2021 tournament will not include South Africa which has decided to compete in the northern hemisphere from next season, at least temporarily.

Chasing 166 for victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday, CSK fell short by by seven runs, with skipper Dhoni staying unbeaten on 47 off 36 balls. “I was not able to middle a lot of deliveries. Was trying to hit it too hard. When the wicket is slightly at the slower side, it is better to time it. Looking at outfield it was subconsciously coming to us to hit the ball hard,” Dhoni said. This was his side’s third defeat in four matches. Asked about his struggle towards the end, Dhoni said,” I tried to get as much as time as possible. It is quite dry out here. So, the throat gets dry and you start to cough. When you have legal signs, you can take some time off.” Dhoni made three changes to his playing XI but could not arrest the slide. He acknowledged that they need to find solutions. “Long time back once we lost three in a row. We need to get a lot of things right. It is the professionalism. We need to take our catches, not bowl no-balls. Those are the controllables and may be we are getting too relaxed,” he said. “We have been a bit too relaxed at times. After the 16th over, we had two good overs but overall we could have been slightly better. “Nobody wants to drop catches but at this level, we need to draw a line and say these catches that need to be taken, especially when the team hasn’t been doing that outstandingly well,” he said, referring to the spilled chances when SRH’s Abhishek Sharma was batting. “Catches like these can hamper your knockout stage games. It is very important to be at your best. There are plenty of positives in this game but we will try to come back strong.” SRH skipper David Warner took a big gamble by asking 18-year old Abdul Samad to bowl the final over when CSK needed 28 runs. The Australian defended his decision. “I backed him (Samad). I had no option. We tried to kill the game in the 19th over with Khaleel there with five balls to bowl. Could have given it to Abhishek, but Samad with his height and the way he bowled tonight, he had to bowl the last one,” said Warner. He also praised Proyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma for their gritty batting under pressure. “It’s my message to the youngsters, to go out their and score some runs.

Genocide, the nations declared, was “condemned by the civilized world” and justified intervention in the affairs of sovereign states. Now, a small but growing number of world leaders including Pope Francis and French President Emmanuel Macron have begun citing an offense they say poses a similar threat to humanity and remains beyond the reach of international criminal law: ecocide, or widespread destruction of the environment. The pope describes ecocide as “the massive contamination of air, land and water,” or “any action capable of producing an ecological disaster,” and it a sin for Roman Catholics. The Pontiff has also endorsed a campaign by environmental activists and legal scholars to make ecocide the fifth crime before the International Criminal Court in The Hague as a legal deterrent to the kinds of far-reaching environmental damage that are driving mass extinction, ecological collapse and climate change. The monumental step, which faces a long road of global debate, would mean political leaders and corporate executives could face charges and imprisonment for \"ecocidal\" acts. To make their case, advocates point to the Amazon, where fires raged out of control in 2019, and where the rainforest may now be so degraded than it draws in. At the poles, human activity is thawing a frozen Arctic and destabilizing the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Across the globe, climate change is disrupting the reliable seasonal rhythms that have sustained human life for millennia, while hurricanes, floods and other climate-driven disasters have in the last six months. Fossil fuel pollution has annually in recent years, according to a study in Environmental Research, more than tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS combined. One in 4 mammals . For amphibians, it’s 4 in 10. Damage to nature has become so extensive and widespread around the world that many environmentalists speak of ecocide to describe numerous environmentally devastated hot spots: The campaign to criminalize ecocide is now moving from the fringe of advocacy into global diplomacy, pushed by a growing recognition among advocates and many political leaders that climate change and environmental causes are tied inherently to human rights and social justice. The effort remains a long shot and is at least years from fruition, international and environmental law experts say. Advocates will have to navigate political tensions over whether national governments or the international community have ultimate control over natural resources. And they’ll likely face opposition from countries with high carbon emissions and deep ties to industrial development. The environmentalists must also figure out how criminal law would address climate change, which has been driven by practices like burning coal and gasoline that are not only legal, but central to the global economy. The campaign to make ecocide a crime, however, is about more than law. Jojo Mehta, who launched the Stop Ecocide campaign in 2017 with Polly Higgins, a Scottish lawyer who died in 2019, describes it as a moral and practical issue as well. “We use criminal law to draw moral lines,” Mehta said. “We say something’s not accepted, your murder is not acceptable. And so, simply putting mass damage and destruction of nature below that red line actually makes a huge difference, and it will make a difference to the people that are financing what is going on.” Scott W. Badenoch Jr., an American environmental lawyer who favors the criminalization of ecocide, used the term to describe the state, and fate, of the Earth. “Ecocide is now endemic all over the planet,” he said. “The structures of ecology that have held up living organisms on Earth, since time immemorial, are collapsing everywhere.” He added, “Ecocide is now, frankly, the process that we are living in on Earth.” The concept of ecocide was born of tragedy. Over a period of 10 years, the United States government sprayed of powerful herbicides, including Agent Orange, across the countryside in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to expose enemy sanctuaries during the Vietnam War. The dioxin-laced chemicals defoliated verdant jungle and caused cancers, neurological disease and birth defects in people living nearby.

In 1970, Yale biologist Arthur Galston invoked the destruction to call on the world to outlaw what he called “ecocide.” More than 20 years later, the global community came together to form the International Criminal Court, which was formally established in 2002 under a treaty called the Rome Statute to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes when its member countries, which currently , fail to do so themselves. Early drafts of the Rome Statute included the crime of environmental destruction, after opposition from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, based on various concerns, including that it wasn’t precisely defined. Instead, it was relegated to a wartime offense that has never been enforced. As a result, international criminal law includes few guardrails to prevent peacetime environmental destruction. “There's a big gap and something needs to fill it,” said Badenoch, a visiting attorney at the Environmental Law Institute. “We currently cannot hold big corporations or big governments accountable for ecocide,” Badenoch added. “So, what do you do? We name and shame — that's all we've got.” Decades of oil extraction in Nigeria by subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell, for example, have in parts of the country with benzene and other toxic pollutants, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Civil lawsuits have taken years to wind through European courts, and no laws were strong enough to prevent the damage from happening, though Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary was recently . Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, that says many of the spills have come as a result of sabotage and theft, and that the company has been working with stakeholders to clean up the pollution identified by the U.N. Environment Program. The International Criminal Court's supranational authority would make an ecocide crime particularly powerful, said Kate Mackintosh, executive director of the Promise Institute for Human Rights at the University of California Los Angeles. An ecocide crime would require International Criminal Court members to enact their own national ecocide laws, and failure to enforce those laws would enable the international court to step in. While political leaders and warlords have been the usual targets of the court, an ecocide crime could place business executives on notice, too. “That could make a difference in corporate boardroom conversations,” Mackintosh said. Even the threat of being labeled an international criminal, she said, might deter destructive corporate behavior. “I mean, for PR, it doesn’t look good, does it?” Mackintosh said making ecocide a crime could help in weak states, where corporate polluters are sometimes more powerful than national governments. “The likelihood of any criminal prosecution taking place in that state is pretty low,” she said. “But with an international crime, that’s actually not a bar.” China, the United States, India and Russia — four of the world’s top polluters — are not members of the International Criminal Court, but if a corporation based in one of those countries were to operate within a member state, as many of them do, their executives could fall under the court’s jurisdiction. The push to criminalize ecocide remained on the periphery until December 2019, when Vanuatu and the Maldives, two island nations threatened by rising seas and climate change-driven extreme weather, recommended that the court consider amending its statute to “criminalize acts that amount to ecocide.” “Our legacy and our future are at stake,” Vanuatu’s ambassador to the European Union, John Licht, , stressing a “common bond” that united all the world’s people. “Our lives are intertwined by the environment we live in.” Willy Missack, who has served as part of Vanuatu’s delegation to the United Nations climate negotiations, said diplomats from other countries expressed shock when “little tiny Vanuatu” — a remote archipelago of more than 80 islands in the South Pacific — said it wanted to take on global powers and the fossil fuel industry through the courts. But the fact that corporations can continue to profit from carbon emissions that are threatening his country’s future, Missack said, makes the legal case clear. “It is not right,” he said, “and this is where justice comes in.” After Vanuatu asked the International Criminal Court to consider criminalizing ecocide, Mehta’s Stop Ecocide Foundation independently convened a panel of international legal experts, including Mackintosh of UCLA, to draft a clear definition of ecocide.\", start_char_idx=4435, end_char_idx=9086, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='d4324430-f60f-4f98-94f7-2607ca3de9f0', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'world', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ecocide-movement-pushes-new-international-crime-environmental-destruction-n1263142', 'title': \"'Ecocide' movement pushes for a new international crime: Environmental destruction\", 'published_date': 'April 7, 2021, 9:00 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='1dd4964f-f144-43be-97f4-1df72b5dd523', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'world', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ecocide-movement-pushes-new-international-crime-environmental-destruction-n1263142', 'title': \"'Ecocide' movement pushes for a new international crime: Environmental destruction\", 'published_date': 'April 7, 2021, 9:00 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, hash='668383544b52fa045e0942efbb5182dcc1aa19d048a186ec403bc1d3eb2ffcf7'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5502cd74-9b9e-4901-9c5d-ebdb847385d3', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'world', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ecocide-movement-pushes-new-international-crime-environmental-destruction-n1263142', 'title': \"'Ecocide' movement pushes for a new international crime: Environmental destruction\", 'published_date': 'April 7, 2021, 9:00 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, hash='e428527616ce339b7fec25ba6559f93151ba992a9d8594689b1e215c720a5230'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3d156588-f3f9-4ce3-909d-781411a48345', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='7feb5082d9f946f6ff935e0cb8c63c11c6f100cb11b43cfe9f5e59e63aeb607b')}, text='They plan to publish their definition in June, at which point they hope at least one of the court’s member nations will formally propose that the court adopt ecocide as the fifth international crime against peace. Mehta has said the definition would likely require of environmental destruction related to practices like widespread logging, drilling, mining and deep-sea trawling. Richard J. Rogers, a British expert in international criminal law who is a partner at Global Diligence and a member of the drafting panel, said it may be relatively straightforward to criminalize certain acts, like destruction of a forest or waterway. But climate change poses a greater challenge: Not only is it difficult to connect polluters to specific harms, he said, but there’s also nothing illegal about extracting or burning fossil fuels. “The situation we\\'re dealing with is that the carbon system, which has fueled our economies since the Industrial Revolution, has not only been lawful, but it\\'s been encouraged,” Rogers said. Another point that the drafters will have to grapple with is whether the crime of ecocide should require prosecutors to prove that humans have been harmed. Mackintosh said that while this “human harm” threshold could prove appealing politically — the court\\'s existing crimes all largely involve harm to humans — focusing ecocide only on the environment could make it easier for prosecutors to prove, especially when it comes to harms related to climate change, which are often incremental and indirect. If a nation agrees to introduce the ecocide proposal to the International Criminal Court for consideration, that is when even harder work will begin. Ratification is a multistep process that would require support from either two-thirds or seven-eighths of the court’s members, depending on the type of amendment introduced. (Vanuatu still supports the campaign, but Covid-19 and the country’s “limited resources for international diplomacy” have put its ecocide advocacy on hold, said Dreli Solomon, a spokesman for Vanuatu’s embassy in Brussels.) While no country has committed to formally proposing that the court adopt ecocide, the campaign is gaining traction, fueled by the youth-led climate movement and radical new groups like Extinction Rebellion. In December, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès asked International Criminal Court member states to of adopting ecocide as a crime. A member of Belgium’s Parliament has also proposed a bill to criminalize ecocide. And French lawmakers are working on legislation to make ecocide an punishable by fines and prison, though Stop Ecocide as “weak.” At least 10 countries have national ecocide laws already, including Vietnam, which enacted the law in 1990. Separately, French lawyers in January filed a request on behalf of Amazonian indigenous groups asking the International Criminal Court to investigate Bolsonaro of Brazil for crimes against humanity. The appeal alleges that deforestation encouraged by Bolsonaro’s government and other policies have forced indigenous people from their homes and even led to murders in the region. While the request relies on citations of crimes the court already addresses, the lawyers who submitted it the case is also an example of ecocide. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said in a statement that \"the Bolsonaro administration is taking concrete action to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples and ensure the future of the Amazon.\" The embassy said that over 70 percent of the eligible Indigenous population has received initial Covid-19 vaccinations and that deforestation rates in the Amazon were 21 percent lower from August to January , compared to the same period a year earlier. Badenoch said that while the hurdles to adopting a new international crime are high, they are not insurmountable. “These things take a long time and they are complex,” he said. “But they can be done.” While the campaign for an ecocide law could take years — if it is successful at all — advocates say the effort could bear fruit much sooner: The ecocide campaign has thrust the concept into public discussion. Mehta doesn’t expect the campaign to catch fire in the United States, but after four years of President Donald Trump, she’s heartened by the arrival of John Kerry, Biden’s special climate envoy. “We don’t expect the U.S. to join the ICC any time soon, but that said, the conversation around ecocide itself, we don’t see any reason why it can’t start happening in the U.S.,” she said.

As of July 1, 2020, at least 1,550 climate change cases have been filed in 38 countries, . In 2015, a Dutch court ruled in the Urgenda Climate Case that the government had acted negligently by failing to take aggressive enough action to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the ruling in in 2019 and ordered the government to hit specific emissions reductions targets, sparking a series of similar lawsuits in other countries. In one of those lawsuits, a Paris administrative court for failing to meet its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling relied, in part, on France’s nonbinding commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, taking what had been the soft pledge of politics and turning it into a legally binding commitment. Mehta has framed an ecocide law as a counterweight to the failings of the Paris Agreement, saying in that it offers “a way to correct the shortcomings” of the global climate pact. “Whereas Paris lacks sufficient ambition, transparency and accountability, the criminalization of ecocide would be an enforceable deterrent.” Alex Whiting, a professor at Harvard Law School and former coordinator of prosecutions at the International Criminal Court, said that making ecocide a crime before the court would have tremendous impact, even if only a few cases were actually prosecuted. “When a crime becomes an international crime, it has a ripple effect,” he said. “The environment is the issue of our time. Being able to do something about that seems important.” In Vanuatu, though, there is a sense that the pace of climate change is beginning to outrun the country’s ability to adapt. Cyclones that have devastated the islands are expected to intensify as the globe continues to warm. Missack, the Vanuatu diplomat, said the effects of climate change run much deeper than damage from storms. Most of the country’s residents depend on the crops they grow and the fish they catch, so their lives are intertwined with the environment around them. Recently, the harvest of yam, a key crop that is , was disrupted, throwing it out of alignment with the seasonal and celestial markers and accompanying rituals that normally tell farmers when to reap. “One day we will talk about the stars, and this is how the ritual goes. But it will never be the same spirit, the same soul of the ritual,” Missack said. “And that loss, none of the money in this world can pay for it.”', start_char_idx=13590, end_char_idx=16465,

The other members of the emissary team were local tribal community leader Telam Boraiya, retired teacher Rudra Kere and sarpanch of Surkunda panchayat in Bijapur district, Rukmni Ekka. \\xa0 With relief writ large on his face, the jawan after his release told reporters, “They (Naxals) treated me well when I was in their custody”. As soon as he was handed over to the emissaries Mr Manhas contacted his family members in Jammu through the cell phone of a journalist present and informed them that he had been set free and was coming home very soon, a journalist who accompanied the delegation told this newspaper from the spot. Sources disclosed to this newspaper that the jawan was spotted by local villagers after the April 3 encounter who handed him to the Maoists. “Maoists had grilled him to extract information on the strength of the security forces deployed in the region and the kinds of weapons they use,” sources said. \\xa0 Maoist guerillas led by commander of PLGA’s battalion number one Madvi Hidma ambushed a search party of security personnel in Terram area on April 3 killing 22 jawans and injuring 31 others.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2801, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='9e61a3ef-f12f-463a-abf0-2bb2b38fa4ea', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/world/south-asia/090421/sc-allows-deportation-of-rohingya-refugees-detained-at-jammu-to-their-parent-country.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='0ac15c33-a8a1-4b59-8926-7311da6520b8', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/world/south-asia/090421/sc-allows-deportation-of-rohingya-refugees-detained-at-jammu-to-their-parent-country.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, hash='5ab2519424321c2bb9f88cacccea4a51041b0fb6129010a6f1c643c43c9444e8'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='85e3b8a3-5442-4a13-ad60-d5ef501b9da3', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/090421/maoists-free-cobra-commando-after-5-days-of-captivity.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, hash='8dbea832b6825d9eb10413b96d8ce9355356a8bb624511d3cfb110b0caa34b34'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a6bf84eb-afce-4729-bde9-8ae1b0ef2d5d', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='2e67120501f784ef5c357cbca2074916e8ddb65bec2c6ffee01de335d02dabdb')}, text='The Supreme Court on Thursday permitted the deportation of Rohingya refugees detained at Jammu.

The Ramnani family, which migrated to India during partition, and set up the bakery, originally belonged to Karachi. However, the MNS would not hear anything of the emotional ties the family had with a city it left behind even as later generations of the Ramnanis began running the business. And the claims that it was \\'successful\\' in its campaign against Karachi Bakery, soon followed with MNS leader Haji Saif Shaikh, who led the stir, taking credit on Twitter for the closure of the bakery in Mumbai. \\xa0 \"Nothing could be farther from the truth,\" Rajesh Ramnani told here on Thursday. \"The lease period was over and it could not be renewed due to cost factors. There is no other reason for Karachi Bakery closing its operations in Mumbai. We will continue looking for appropriate premises, and when it is found, we are willing to reopen there,\" Ramnani said. Though the MNS leader tweeted about Karachi Bakery\\'s closure in Mumbai, there were several others from that city who mourned the shutting down.

As chairman of the Telangana Joint Action Committee, he coordinated with all political parties and employees unions and in the fight for statehood.

Jayakumar, also the AIADMK organising secretary, scripted his own success in remaining as the MLA of Royapuram Assembly constituency for a quarter of a century, inflicting humiliating defeats on successive DMK and Congress candidates who challenged him. \"DJ Annan,\" (elder brother) as he is affectionately called by his supporters in his constituency, had lost only during the 1996 assembly election to DMK\\'s R Mathivanan, when a strong anti-incumbency swept away the then ruling AIADMK in the hustings. \\xa0 He registered his first impressive win in the 1991 election, trouncing Mathivanan and maintained his winning streak in elections in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. His different campaign styles continue to draw crowds and the ever smiling former Assembly Speaker does not hesitate to wear the white cap similar to that worn by party founder and late chief minister M G Ramachandran, or sing a popular number from \"Puratchi Thalaivar\\'s\" films, to connect with the people. Ramachandran is addressed as \\'Puratchi Thalaivar,\\' meaning revolutionary leader. \\xa0 Jayakumar even sprang a surprise recently by playing kabaddi with the youth on his way home after winding up the day\\'s hectic election campaign. His unparalleled popularity is something that cannot be underestimated, but rival DMK insists a change is required. \"It is time for change, the time for the Rising Sun (DMK symbol) under the leadership M K Stalin to emerge,\" has been the constant refrain of the party\\'s 54-year old candidate R Murthy\\'s election campaign. He is the proprietor of iDream Cinemas and iDream properties. \\xa0 But Jayakumar, contesting for the seventh time from his home turf, is confident of emerging victorious this time too. Despite its mixed bag of communities, traffic woes of residents of Royapuram assembly constituency have not ended. Fishermen, who play a major role in tilting the scales, are apprehensive of the multi-crore developmental programmes in the coastal villages as these threaten their livelihood opportunities. \"DMK\\'s assurance for a sea bridge project connecting Chennai Port-Thiruvottriyur to eliminate traffic congestion and fasten commercial access to and out of the port is not needed. This will only corrode the livelihood opportunities of the fisher folk,\" says Bharathi Ku, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association (SIFWA). \\xa0 \"What we need is livelihood protection initiatives, not multi-crore projects that eat into our villages,\" he argues. The fishermen are also opposed to establishing desalination plants in the coastal villages. \"The ever increasing population and floating population of at least 50,000 people on an average per day into Royapuram for trading and other activities makes this constituency prone to frequent traffic snarls,besides taxing existing resources,\" 60-year old Jayakumar, who hails from the fishing community, told P T I. \\xa0 Despite being a small area, the density of population is high and streets are narrow in Royapuram. Not less than 3,500 autos make sorties into Royapuram on any given day, Jayakumar, who is also an advocate, claims. \"So this calls for implementing a master plan to meet the increasing requirements of the people.

The ruling TMC has embraced it as its main poll plank to counter the rise of the BJP\\'s Hindutva narrative in the state. \\xa0 It has branded BJP as a \"party of outsiders\" and has fanned the \\'Bengali pride\\' by coming up with a poll slogan \"Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chai\" (Bengal wants its own daughter) creating a poll narrative of sub-nationalism to counter the saffron party\\'s identity politics. The electoral discourse in Bengal, where poll battles are fought on ideological lines, had in the past mostly steered clear of sub-nationalism like identity politics. \"This is for the first time we have made Bengali pride our main poll plank. Bengali pride is not just about Bengalis; it appeals to all sons of the soil,\" senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy told PTI. \\xa0 Another senior TMC leader said \"divisive politics and religious polarisation can be countered with sub-nationalism and regionalism.\" BJP has blamed Trinamool Congress for bringing up the issue of Bengali pride saying it is harping on nationalism, development and identity politics as it senses defeat in its citadel. \"BJP is in power in so many states, but we have never tried to impose any language or culture. This is a baseless allegation as TMC has nothing to showcase to seek votes,\" BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said. \\xa0 BJP national president J P Nadda claimed at various poll rallies that only BJP can restore the Bengali pride and that \"TMC represents everything that is opposite to it\". To counter the narrative and project itself as a party in sync with Bengali culture and ethos, BJP has propped up Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee as its icon. It has also been observing the anniversaries of Bengali icons Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Parties cutting across political lines feel that the issue has its pitfalls and will have a cascading effect on the federal structure in the days to come. \\xa0 They agree that sub-nationalism can no longer be ignored in Bengal as it is reflective of the state\\'s socio- political history which has always preferred opposing or challenging the party at the Centre or a bigger political force and have refused submission. Born out of the Congress on January 1, 1998, TMC had adopted the evocative slogan \\'Maa Mati Manush\\' (Mother, Land and People) carefully blending socialism and secularism that countered the then communists and their doctrines. The rise of BJP in Bengal\\'s political map made TMC realise that its socialist slogan was not enough to offset \\'Hindutva\\', especially when it has been branded by the saffron camp as a party that favours only minorities. \\xa0 It then came up with the narrative of Bengali pride and insider versus outsider debate and has it as its main poll and ideological planks. The desecration of the bust of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar during a BJP procession in the last phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, followed by the publication of the final NRC list in Assam in August that year gave TMC a golden opportunity to brand BJP as an \"anti-Bengali\" party. The NRC list had left out the names of 19 lakh people in Assam, many of them Bengalis. The state BJP\\'s over-dependence on the party\\'s central leadership with leaders from other states calling the shots have not helped matters for the saffron party. It has in fact further fuelled the \"insider versus outsider\" debate. \\xa0 BJP national general secretary and Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya feels that TMC is only interested in winning the votes and has nothing to do with Bengali pride. \"These are gimmicks to win the election.

To woo the Bengali voters, the saffron party in its poll manifesto promised Tagore Smriti Puraskar on the lines of the Nobel prize to honour globally recognised talents and the Satyajit Ray Award on the lines of the Oscar award. It also promised a Gurudev Centre for Cultural Excellence and a film city was promised named after matinee idol Uttam Kumar. \\xa0 TMC has blamed the ascent of BJP in Bengal\\'s political sphere and the increased activities of far-right Hindu outfits which are more in sync with north Indian culture for the politicisation of ethnic sentiments in the state. But a quick look at post-Idependence Bengal\\'s socio- political history shows how Bengali sub-nationalism has always played a role before going dormant in the past few decades. The effect of sub-nationalism in the state was first felt when Congress led by the then chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy in the mid-fifties lost the election to nine municipalities and an assembly by-poll on the issue of merger of West Bengal and Bihar. \\xa0 The Left Front and Praja Socialist Party had then opposed it tooth and nail stating that Bengalis would beome a minority post the merger. Till the mid \\'90S the issue of Bengali pride was not overtly brought into play, as both the mainstream political parties - the Congress ande CPI(M) had several homegrown stalwarts. There were leaders like Jyoti Basu, Bhupesh Gupta, Indrajit Gupta from the Left and Siddartha Sankar Ray, Pranab Mukherjee, A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury from the Congress. However, the CPI(M), which over the years has moulded itself as a party of the Bengali bhadralok (gentleman) through its anti-Congress and anti-Centre stance, smacked of subtle sub-nationalism by often citing \\'Centre\\'s oppression against Bengal\\'. \\xa0 Noted Historian Sugata Bose contends that sub- nationalism was always in the play in Bengal politics in a covert manner. \"The issue of Bengali sub-nationalism was there in post-Independence Bengal, though in a very subtle way. It was never a major rallying point. The Left\\'s constant attack on the Centre and Congress alleging step-motherly treatment towards Bengal was aimed in that direction. \"But after the formation of TMC in 1998, Bengali sub-nationalism was never an issue as the party and the Bengal CPI-M which it defeated were regional players,\" Bose, the Gardiner Professor of Oceanic history at Harvard University, told PTI. \\xa0 \"It is now back as a major poll issue as TMC, a regional party is fighting against BJP, a national party. It has gained momentum as BJP does not have strong homegrown leaders in Bengal and is overdependent on central leaders,\" he said. Several outfits like Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha have emerged in the state\\'s political landscape and they have accused the saffron camp of trying to \"impose Hindi and north Indian culture\" on Bengal. \"The way Bengalis are demographically threatened by non-Bengalis, the day is not far when they will turn into a minority in their own land. This will not only be just in terms of population but also culturally. We are happy that Bengali sub-nationalism has emerged as a rallying point in this polls,\" Kaushik Maiti, a senior leader of Bangla Pokkho, told PTI. \\xa0 These outfits have been raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state. The narrative has its drawbacks as it alienates the Hindi-speaking population, who are a deciding factor in at least 30 of the state\\'s 294 Assembly seats. Sensing this, the TMC has tied up with the RJD and Samajwadi Party for the assembly polls. The two parties have offered unconditional support to it and will campaign for TMC in the Hindi-speaking belts of the state. Political analyst Suman Bhattacharya feels that Bengali sub-nationalism will play an important role in the assembly poll and will be a deciding factor in several seats. \\xa0 \"It had never played such a major role in the polls.', start_char_idx=3765, end_char_idx=7782, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='1480e1ba-1357-426f-a3bd-859f237936c6', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='58339fa5-9198-4cbb-b4b0-3744e37fbedc', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='d186dba99b86298d310c0383817570de379967347a07a63c03459dc3bfebb0cb'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='dd6061b4-9e09-40ce-bf3c-bbe5d5a170a4', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='27fd84cb5c71a265374946eb3564b8b4d6a4320a9edb513b96b9365602476956'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='82ee5ae7-9e5a-43e8-a685-75aa9ed6e823', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='6e2a513a88f4b0546d65b89aeb9edfe167c390a403d14a696dd94d5c93aaba91')}, text='\"It had never played such a major role in the polls.

He was 93. Clark, whose father, Tom Clark, was attorney general and U.S. Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his Manhattan home, a family member, Sharon Welch, announced to media outlets After serving in President Lyndon Johnson’s Cabinet in 1967 and ’68, Clark set up a private law practice in New York in which he championed civil rights, fought racism and the death penalty, and represented declared foes of the United States including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. “If you don’t insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others?” he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedy’s Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever — Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Truman’s attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clark’s client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers. There were usually two to three dozen active cases on Clark’s legal calendar, and about 100 more in the background. Capital punishment cases were a staple. “We talk about civil liberties,” he said. “We have the largest prison population per capita on Earth.

How we can become triggered by seemingly innocuous events and find ourselves reacting to situations in unexpected and often irrational ways. He told me about being bullied in high school and how he does not think he will ever fully recover from the trauma of those years. He said he has “learned to deal with it” and “found a way to move on,” but that it still affects him every day and that he will never forgive the people who “tore his life to shreds.” His words and the pain on his face hit me hard. They brought to mind my own childhood, specifically my preteen years, when I was a bully. I have spent the better part of 40 years “forgetting” those days ― the people I have hurt, the damage I’ve done and the trauma I’ve caused. It all came flooding back. I thought, I did not start out as a bully. It was a choice. I was a good kid ― smart, funny and full of life. That all changed in the middle of sixth grade when I was 11 years old.\\xa0 I remember the moment with absolute clarity: It was during a recess break when I was wrestling with one of my classmates. He was one of the boys in my school who was maturing more quickly than the others, including myself. He was tall and ripped. He had the beginnings of a mangy mustache and a voice as deep as Darth Vader’s. He had me on the ground and was straddling my chest. My arms were pinned above my head. We were laughing. He smiled at me. I got an erection. It was the first time I experienced pure panic. I froze. Time stood still as he felt me against him and recognition swept across his face. I heard the words “holy shit” and “faggot,” and saw his smile disappear. I threw him off of me and ran. A single thought followed me: From an early age, I knew that I was different from other boys, but I did not know that I was gay. I knew full well what being gay meant ― it’s hard to grow up in a small town full of machismo and testosterone and not know what being gay meant. I also knew what a “faggot” was and what a “queer” and a “butt pirate” were and all of those other colorful terms. I knew I couldn’t be any of these things. I believed that being gay was bad ― possibly the worst thing that someone could be. I knew it would get you ostracized, mercilessly bullied and beaten to a pulp. I also knew that it could get you killed. My decision to “not be gay” began that day. The change from happy-go-lucky preteen to disgruntled, petulant asshole happened virtually overnight. As the fear of being discovered began to consume my every waking moment, I set about to obliterate the old me and create someone new. I lived in a kill-or-be-killed world, where the tough feasted on the weak, and where being different made you a target. It was a world where only the strong survived, where you were either predator or prey. I knew people who were prey. They were different, and I thought they were weak. I saw what a living hell their lives were. I witnessed the endless torture they endured at the hands of the more popular kids ― the name-calling and the constant mental and physical abuse and how it affected them. This was not a life for me. In the course of just a few short months, I went from a bright, engaged student to an uninterested, disruptive presence in the classroom. My grades plummeted. I became cocky and combative with my peers, I dumped my old friends for a new, tougher crowd and I found myself a girlfriend. I did whatever I could do to deflect the attention away from me and onto somebody else. Thus began the bullying. I was not particularly big or strong for my age, so intimidation by force was not an option for me ― I found friends for that. What I did have was a quick wit and an uncanny ability to find and exploit weaknesses.

For the unfortunate souls who were more noticeable, like the girl with the dark red birthmark on her face or the chubby boy with Coke-bottle glasses, it was easy. For others, I learned what I could about them and then struck when the opportunity presented itself. My most devious move came with Mike, the boy I was wrestling with when this all began. Why he never told anyone about what happened is beyond me. I still wonder why, when presented with such a golden opportunity, he did not expose me. Perhaps he was a decent, compassionate human being? Perhaps he was one of the good guys? Regardless, he did not attack, so I did. I flipped the script and told everyone the erection was his and that he had tried to “stick it in me.” From then on, his nickname was “ass bandit” and his life was hellish. I survived the remaining two years of middle school this way: attacking first, capitalizing on faults and imperfections and ruining lives. It was remarkably easy. The other kids in my school were all too willing to go along with the game because they, like me, had things to hide. Except it was not a game. People were getting hurt and developing emotional scars. I do not remember feeling bad about the suffering I was causing. So governed by the fear of my secret getting out, I ran a scorched-earth campaign against anyone I felt threatened by, consequences be damned. I did not believe I had a choice ― I thought it was a matter of life and death. When I entered high school, I was forced to adapt using new methods of survival. I ended up in a school on the opposite side of the city away from my friends, where I was suddenly a very small fish in a very big pond and nobody was afraid of me. Alone and vulnerable, I learned to blend in, to camouflage and disguise myself, to keep my head down and my mouth shut. Being invisible was easy and a lot less work than being a bully. I concentrated on my classes and on avoiding Chris, one of my classmates.\\xa0\\xa0 Chris Jones was the only “out” gay person in school and the only person I was afraid of. His audacity was overwhelming. How dare he have the strength to be himself, to live an authentic life, to be out and proud and fearless? I would lie awake at night stressing about how easily he could destroy my life. It would only take one glance ― a single moment of recognition ― and everything would come crashing down for me. He would know I was gay, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and he would expose me for the fraud I was. It was equal parts fear and fascination. I longed to be seen ― by him or anyone ― but the terror that elicited was paralyzing. In retrospect, what I really wanted was not to feel so utterly and completely alone.\\xa0 Today, I see the boy who did those terrible things hiding in the darkness near my heart. He is utterly and completely alone. I reach out to him, tell him that I love him, but I do not think he believes me. He knows that I am deeply ashamed. He knows that I am broken, and he doesn’t trust that a broken man can fix things. He is anxious and afraid and furtive. He runs.\\xa0 The adult me is all of these things. I battle with depression and a panic disorder. I often do not feel worthy of love. I run. There is a quote by Maya Angelou that reads, “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” I find some comfort in these words.\\xa0 What I did then was survive. It was all I knew how to do. I certainly “know better” now, but it is ultimately the “do better” that matters. Perhaps the act of “doing better” is where compassion and forgiveness lie.\\xa0 Doing better is accepting responsibility for my actions and apologizing to those I hurt. I am truly sorry for the pain I caused, the scars I created and the trauma I inflicted. I know what I did was wrong — terribly wrong — and in no way am I asking for absolution.

Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday attacked the\\xa0Centre\\xa0for playing politics during the pandemic by giving more vaccines to BJP-ruled states and fewer to non-BJP governed states.\\xa0\\xa0He\\xa0accused the Centre of giving Maharashtra only 7.5 lakh doses against its demand for 40 lakh vaccines. The minister said the state was aiming to vaccinate five to six lakh people daily to break the chain of transmission.\\xa0 Tope also held meetings with the manufacturers of Covid-19 drug Remdesivir and asked them to double the production for the state. In order to increase beds for patients, the Pune administration has tied up with the Army Hospital to provide 40 ICU beds. \\xa0 Health minister Harsh Vardhan said: “The hue and cry by certain states about partisanship by the Union government is just a farce, an attempt to hide their own incompetence. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are two of the top three states based on the allocation of Covid-19 vaccine doses. Both are non-BJP governed states. Let’s put an end to the fear-mongering now! Covid-19 vaccine doses: Total administered: 9 crore plus, in stock/nearing delivery to states: 4.3 crore plus. Where does the question of shortages arise? We’re continuously monitoring and enhancing supply.” \\xa0According to him, Maharashtra was given 1.06 crore vaccine doses, Gujarat 1.05 crore and Rajasthan 1.04 crore, while the country’s average distribution was 37.11 lakh.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3077, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='22431169-da5f-4317-a38d-de52dac8ebfc', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/11th-hour-review-tamannaah-bhatia-tries-her-best-but-is-let-down-by-the-shows-unflattering-storyline-9516911.html', 'title': \"11th Hour review: Tamannaah Bhatia tries her best, but is let down by the show's unflattering storyline\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a5f09171-8409-40a0-ab73-36aa9b56a829', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/11th-hour-review-tamannaah-bhatia-tries-her-best-but-is-let-down-by-the-shows-unflattering-storyline-9516911.html', 'title': \"11th Hour review: Tamannaah Bhatia tries her best, but is let down by the show's unflattering storyline\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='e115ca4640add5f5cd24e47312f99371b2329ad0f916e655e99b9a9854a4092a'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c4105b35-c2a7-4ada-8bdc-4741e393b83a', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/090421/focus-on-vaccine-festival-from-april-11-14-modi-to-cms.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, hash='470b74b2dca96de9d6ae34eec1ac5523d38ab4cf1ac9d55247d09649fb60d3d5'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='dd2ade71-4502-42b6-a73f-76a6210a3b8a', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='6bedca2e485191b3bd5487d9860e8bb19aceb0bed41735c5863cdb631d3f6458')}, text='The phrase ‘Eleventh hour’ has an interesting connotation in terms of what it signifies. Anything can happen at the last moment and life can change in the blink of an eye. It’s this notion that drives the story in 11th Hour, directed by Praveen Sattaru, where the CEO of an Indian conglomerate, Aratrika Reddy finds herself racing against time to save her company from going bankrupt. Adapted from Upendra Namburi’s novel, , the series has been written by Pradeep, and has Tamannaah playing the central character. From the outset, Pradeep draws parallels between Aratrika Reddy’s journey and a young girl’s journey through the woods in the fable of Red Riding Hood. There’s danger lurking everywhere, and a big bad wolf poses a huge threat to the young girl’s life. In Aratrika’s life, there are multiple people who want to say her downfall, including her own father who can’t stand her. The world of is filled with fascinating people. There are three different investors and competitors, backed by foreign companies, who are baying for blood and the chairman of a bank who has a personal vendetta against Aratrika’s company. She has to repay Rs 10,000 crores to the bank and all doors seem shut. She has about eight hours to pull off this impossible task. The rest of the story is about how Aratrika manages to survive at the 11th hour. The entire story unfolds in a hotel, which is turned into a battleground for the long night. Aratrika’s competitors entice her with lucrative offers to save her company; however, the catch is that her dream of producing clean energy will be taken away from her. She resists every offer hoping that a miracle occurs somehow. The stakes keep rising and the pressure is intense. captures all this drama and action, and the premise itself is quite interesting. But then, there’s a big catch with the series. The race against time doesn’t quite translate to the screen. You understand the motivations of the characters and why they want to snatch away the company from Aratrika, but the storytelling isn’t engaging enough. In short, the story is tense, but the drama isn’t. Multiple flashbacks are shown to establish characters and backstories, which have led to the crisis which Aratrika is facing, but on the downside, all this takes the focus away from what’s happening in the present. And somewhere, you can’t help but feel that the characters are repressing themselves because they have to be dignified. This takes the edge away from the proceedings, and even when the stakes are high, it doesn’t strike you hard enough to root for Aratrika. On the other hand, Tamannaah finds herself in an interesting role which is refreshing. She comes across as a cold-blooded person, but behind this veneer, is extremely emotional and will do anything to save her company. Tamannaah juggles between these two personas quite well, and she shines throughout the series. Shatru and Adit make a solid impression in their respective roles, and the rest of the cast including Jayaprakash too does justice to their roles. The production design, cinematography, and music are impressive throughout the story. has scale, grandeur, and a solid premise which is quite different from what we’ve seen in recent times. But it doesn’t quite hook you in a manner that you expect after you understand what’s at stake.

Even the day before, he sounded hopeful because he had heard that the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney\\xa0 .\\xa0 Brandon read his speech to the Pardon Office to me before presenting it, and the profound level of remorse he expressed brought me to tears. He was a different person from the teenager arrested over 20 years earlier. Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed. I began writing to death row prisoners after reading Bryan Stevenson’s book \\xa0about an innocent man condemned to death row.\\xa0Books often change my course; I read \\xa0a few years ago and haven’t eaten meat since. After reading “Just Mercy,” I sent out postcards to about a dozen death row inmates across the U.S. When I started what my husband, family and friends universally consider an odd hobby, I had no idea how gratifying and life-altering writing death row prisoners would become.\\xa0\\xa0 When we first began exchanging letters a year ago, I warned Brandon that I had one other pen pal at Terre Haute federal penitentiary. In my experience, inmates do not want to write someone with multiple pen pals at the same facility out of legitimate concerns over privacy and safety. Brandon’s immediate response was, “Well, then that makes me one of the two luckiest men at Terre Haute.” To call himself lucky after over 23 hours a day in a six-by-eight-foot cell was the first of many lessons in gratitude Brandon taught me. Brandon was 18 when he took part in a robbery gone wrong. He had no prior history of violence. Brandon’s friends carjacked a white couple, Todd and Stacey Bagley, youth ministers innocently offering a ride to kids purportedly in need. Later,\\xa0Brandon rejoined the group only to see Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the crime, fatally shoot Todd and Stacey in the head at close range. The man who had just shot two people in the head and still had a gun in his hand then ordered Brandon and three other teens to set the car on fire with the couple’s bodies inside. \\xa0 At trial, , meaning he offered the jury no alternative perspective on the charges.\\xa0Brandon was the only accomplice not given an opportunity to plead guilty.\\xa0The other accomplices pleaded out and received prison sentences; two are home with their families now.\\xa0 Brandon was falsely portrayed as a hardened high-level gang member. Prosecutors suppressed evidence by their own gang expert that the gang had a 13-tier hierarchy with . Brandon never got the chance to clarify his case in court — it remained the story poorly told at trial two decades earlier. Five of the nine surviving jurors , stating that they would not have voted for the death penalty had prosecutors disclosed all facts at trial and had Brandon’s own lawyer competently defended him.\\xa0\\xa0 In her dissent written hours before Brandon’s execution, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor \\xa0“despite troubling allegations that the Government secured his death sentence by withholding exculpatory evidence and knowingly eliciting false testimony against him. [He] has never had the opportunity to test the merits of those claims in court. Now he never will.” Brandon became the youngest person, based on age when the offense occurred, to be put to death by the federal government in nearly 70 years,\\xa0 . He was 40 when he died.\\xa0 Brandon loved his life, even in its limited capacity on death row. \\xa0in his decades behind bars.\\xa0This is no small feat given that death row is like a prison within a prison, with countless oppressive rules and ensuing frustrations.\\xa0 Brandon mainly spent his time mentoring at-risk youth, reading, crocheting and playing the guitar. Brandon was calmer and more patient than most people I’ve come across; he spoke slowly and thoughtfully and was an avid listener.

They spread slowly across the screen — a brush-stroke here, another there. At first there is no telling what they will add up to, but soon there are enough of them to form a larger picture: the skyline of a city, or a ramshackle section of a city. More specific images now crowd the frame: a busy road, people walking, vehicles zipping by, movie hoardings. A setting has been established, a narrative begun. Gitanjali Rao’s animated film opens with this movement from haziness to clarity; with nebulous blocks used to construct something sharp and defined. A little later, similar blurry boxes of colour will resolve themselves into a small marketplace where we are introduced to two of the film’s protagonists — a flower-seller named Kamala and her school-going sister Tara. These opening scenes depict one version — or one specific experience — of Bombay, and others will soon follow: this is a set of interlinking stories about people from different backgrounds and religions, facing various demons and various types of loneliness. For each of them, “Bombay” is as much a state of mind as a place — the city is of course a bustling physical entity, but it is also a fluid one, constantly shaped and reshaped in the characters’ imaginations. Kamala fantasises about being a princess in a genteel bygone era (and is brought back to rude reality by a who wants to send her to Dubai). Her boyfriend Salim is nourished by the escapist dreams of Bombay’s cinema — and its heroes who can make the impossible possible — but also haunted by memories of the Kashmir he was forced to flee when his parents were gunned down. And, in some of the film’s most elegiac passages, when Shirley D’Souza — an old actress who worked in the 1950s — walks through her nook of the city, colour yields to black and white and the landscape she passes transforms into what it once was…what it still is in her mind’s eye. This depiction of the past moving alongside the present is one of the most striking things about . Old songs like “ ” fleetingly grace the soundtrack. A reflection of Shirley in a mirror shows a younger version of her. Ghosts dance in a graveyard. The sleeve of a shirt — draped across a chair as a stand-in for a long-dead lover — appears to move as if in response to a remark (before one realises that a cat had brushed against it). A weary clock-maker — seemingly a relic of a bygone world, no longer “relevant” — comes alive when presented with a task that only someone like him can do; he asks for his tools — “ ! !” — like a surgeon focused on his work. While this is a Bombay film, and is about the many possibilities of that city, one can also argue that it isn’t about any one place: it is about people and the things they carry inside them, from memories of the past to projections of an imagined future. Watching it, I was strangely reminded of the 2015 Malayalam film , even though there isn’t much surface similarity between these two works or their settings. , intelligently adapted from a Chekhov short story, begins with ethereal images of the Kuttanad backwaters where a child — soon to be sent away from the only home he knows — spends much of his time minding ducks with his grandfather, their boat rowing across a breath-taking network of canals. To a viewer who is more interested in the quick movement of plot than in the establishing of mood, these scenes might feel self-indulgent or pretentious or slow — but as the film progresses, their importance will become clear. These images are essential markers of a childhood that is about to end: they show how much this boy is part of his setting, and what he is going to be separated from.

A few moments in reminded me of that rush to collect images. Similarly, watching Shirley D’Souza and Tara on their walks in , I thought about the ways in which my neighbourhood has changed over the decades, through a gradual accumulation of events: how a leafy park where we used to play cricket as children turned into an overcrowded parking space where residents scowl at each other while manoeuvring their cars; how a large mall complex sprang up in what was once vast barren land occupied only by a dying old tree; how a video-cassette parlour morphed into a DVD store and then disappeared altogether, and a single-screen hall became a shining multiplex. And about how one’s sense of self also changes along with these things, so that you might find yourself — during a walk through the colony — alternating between being a child and an adult with just a small shift in perspective, or in a change in the play of light as you glance at something. What these two films have in common is how they create a sense of a setting as something inseparable from the inner lives of the protagonists. They are plaintive depictions of how places define us and are defined by us.

The acquisition is valued at Rs 3,604 crore. APSEZ had announced acquisition of Warburg Pincus' 31.5 per cent stake in GPL on March 3, 2021, and together with this acquisition, APSEZ would have 89.6 per cent stake in GPL. \\x93Ports play a major role in shaping the future. Through APSEZ's 89.6 per cent stake in Gangavaram port, the Adani Group will greatly expand its pan-India cargo presence. As India's largest private sector port developer and operator, we will accelerate India's and AP's industrialisation,\\x94 Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani said in a tweet. \\xa0 It is the second largest non-major port in Andhra Pradesh with a 64 MT capacity established under concession from Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) that extends till 2059. It is an all-weather, deep water, multipurpose port capable of handling fully laden super cape size vessels of up to 2,00,000 DWT, the statement said. Currently, GPL operates 9 berths and has free hold land of 1,800 acres. With a master plan capacity for 250 MTPA with 31 berths, GPL has sufficient headroom to support future growth. GPL handles a diverse mix of dry and bulk commodities including coal, iron ore, fertilizer, limestone, bauxite, sugar, alumina and steel. \\xa0 GPL is the gateway port for a hinterland spread over 8 states across eastern, southern and central India, the statement said adding it will benefit from APSEZ's pan-India footprint. Karan Adani, CEO and Whole Time Director of APSEZ said, \\x93The acquisition of GPL is a further augmentation of our vision of capitalizing on an expanded logistics network effect that generates greater value as it expands.\\x94 He added that \\x93the associated hinterland we will now be able to tap into is one of the fastest growing in the eastern region and with the logistic synergies APSEZ brings to the table, GPL has a potential to become a 250 MT port.

The Ramnani family, which migrated to India during partition, and set up the bakery, originally belonged to Karachi. However, the MNS would not hear anything of the emotional ties the family had with a city it left behind even as later generations of the Ramnanis began running the business.

There is no other reason for Karachi Bakery closing its operations in Mumbai. We will continue looking for appropriate premises, and when it is found, we are willing to reopen there,\" Ramnani said. Though the MNS leader tweeted about Karachi Bakery\\'s closure in Mumbai, there were several others from that city who mourned the shutting down.

As chairman of the Telangana Joint Action Committee, he coordinated with all political parties and employees unions and in the fight for statehood. Another leader, Cheruku Sudhakar, was booked under Preventive Detention Act and sent to jail for his active participation in the Telangana movement.

The ruling TMC has embraced it as its main poll plank to counter the rise of the BJP\\'s Hindutva narrative in the state. \\xa0 It has branded BJP as a \"party of outsiders\" and has fanned the \\'Bengali pride\\' by coming up with a poll slogan \"Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chai\" (Bengal wants its own daughter) creating a poll narrative of sub-nationalism to counter the saffron party\\'s identity politics. The electoral discourse in Bengal, where poll battles are fought on ideological lines, had in the past mostly steered clear of sub-nationalism like identity politics. \"This is for the first time we have made Bengali pride our main poll plank. Bengali pride is not just about Bengalis; it appeals to all sons of the soil,\" senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy told PTI. \\xa0 Another senior TMC leader said \"divisive politics and religious polarisation can be countered with sub-nationalism and regionalism.\" BJP has blamed Trinamool Congress for bringing up the issue of Bengali pride saying it is harping on nationalism, development and identity politics as it senses defeat in its citadel. \"BJP is in power in so many states, but we have never tried to impose any language or culture. This is a baseless allegation as TMC has nothing to showcase to seek votes,\" BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said. \\xa0 BJP national president J P Nadda claimed at various poll rallies that only BJP can restore the Bengali pride and that \"TMC represents everything that is opposite to it\". To counter the narrative and project itself as a party in sync with Bengali culture and ethos, BJP has propped up Bharatiya Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee as its icon. It has also been observing the anniversaries of Bengali icons Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Parties cutting across political lines feel that the issue has its pitfalls and will have a cascading effect on the federal structure in the days to come. \\xa0 They agree that sub-nationalism can no longer be ignored in Bengal as it is reflective of the state\\'s socio- political history which has always preferred opposing or challenging the party at the Centre or a bigger political force and have refused submission. Born out of the Congress on January 1, 1998, TMC had adopted the evocative slogan \\'Maa Mati Manush\\' (Mother, Land and People) carefully blending socialism and secularism that countered the then communists and their doctrines. The rise of BJP in Bengal\\'s political map made TMC realise that its socialist slogan was not enough to offset \\'Hindutva\\', especially when it has been branded by the saffron camp as a party that favours only minorities. \\xa0 It then came up with the narrative of Bengali pride and insider versus outsider debate and has it as its main poll and ideological planks. The desecration of the bust of social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar during a BJP procession in the last phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, followed by the publication of the final NRC list in Assam in August that year gave TMC a golden opportunity to brand BJP as an \"anti-Bengali\" party. The NRC list had left out the names of 19 lakh people in Assam, many of them Bengalis.

To woo the Bengali voters, the saffron party in its poll manifesto promised Tagore Smriti Puraskar on the lines of the Nobel prize to honour globally recognised talents and the Satyajit Ray Award on the lines of the Oscar award. It also promised a Gurudev Centre for Cultural Excellence and a film city was promised named after matinee idol Uttam Kumar. \\xa0 TMC has blamed the ascent of BJP in Bengal\\'s political sphere and the increased activities of far-right Hindu outfits which are more in sync with north Indian culture for the politicisation of ethnic sentiments in the state. But a quick look at post-Idependence Bengal\\'s socio- political history shows how Bengali sub-nationalism has always played a role before going dormant in the past few decades. The effect of sub-nationalism in the state was first felt when Congress led by the then chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy in the mid-fifties lost the election to nine municipalities and an assembly by-poll on the issue of merger of West Bengal and Bihar. \\xa0 The Left Front and Praja Socialist Party had then opposed it tooth and nail stating that Bengalis would beome a minority post the merger. Till the mid \\'90S the issue of Bengali pride was not overtly brought into play, as both the mainstream political parties - the Congress ande CPI(M) had several homegrown stalwarts. There were leaders like Jyoti Basu, Bhupesh Gupta, Indrajit Gupta from the Left and Siddartha Sankar Ray, Pranab Mukherjee, A B A Ghani Khan Chowdhury from the Congress. However, the CPI(M), which over the years has moulded itself as a party of the Bengali bhadralok (gentleman) through its anti-Congress and anti-Centre stance, smacked of subtle sub-nationalism by often citing \\'Centre\\'s oppression against Bengal\\'. \\xa0 Noted Historian Sugata Bose contends that sub- nationalism was always in the play in Bengal politics in a covert manner. \"The issue of Bengali sub-nationalism was there in post-Independence Bengal, though in a very subtle way. It was never a major rallying point. The Left\\'s constant attack on the Centre and Congress alleging step-motherly treatment towards Bengal was aimed in that direction. \"But after the formation of TMC in 1998, Bengali sub-nationalism was never an issue as the party and the Bengal CPI-M which it defeated were regional players,\" Bose, the Gardiner Professor of Oceanic history at Harvard University, told PTI. \\xa0 \"It is now back as a major poll issue as TMC, a regional party is fighting against BJP, a national party. It has gained momentum as BJP does not have strong homegrown leaders in Bengal and is overdependent on central leaders,\" he said. Several outfits like Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha have emerged in the state\\'s political landscape and they have accused the saffron camp of trying to \"impose Hindi and north Indian culture\" on Bengal. \"The way Bengalis are demographically threatened by non-Bengalis, the day is not far when they will turn into a minority in their own land. This will not only be just in terms of population but also culturally. We are happy that Bengali sub-nationalism has emerged as a rallying point in this polls,\" Kaushik Maiti, a senior leader of Bangla Pokkho, told PTI. \\xa0 These outfits have been raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state. The narrative has its drawbacks as it alienates the Hindi-speaking population, who are a deciding factor in at least 30 of the state\\'s 294 Assembly seats. Sensing this, the TMC has tied up with the RJD and Samajwadi Party for the assembly polls. The two parties have offered unconditional support to it and will campaign for TMC in the Hindi-speaking belts of the state. Political analyst Suman Bhattacharya feels that Bengali sub-nationalism will play an important role in the assembly poll and will be a deciding factor in several seats. \\xa0 \"It had never played such a major role in the polls.', start_char_idx=3765, end_char_idx=7782, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='a0b0a43b-f32a-4f89-85df-c5dc75b04813', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5315cf4e-ad25-427d-bb66-7e27ec2ff150', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='d186dba99b86298d310c0383817570de379967347a07a63c03459dc3bfebb0cb'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='0daf9dd3-7edd-4fb3-ad00-5bc4b9384400', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/230321/bengali-pride-sub-nationalism-emerge-as-rallying-points-in-wb-polls.html', 'title': 'Bengali pride, sub-nationalism emerge as rallying points in WB polls', 'published_date': 'Mar 23, 2021, 12:48 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='27fd84cb5c71a265374946eb3564b8b4d6a4320a9edb513b96b9365602476956'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='279fd7cd-8e7d-4dda-9190-d7916ecfbed7', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='1c95462bd3b59c199eb43bab18bb3b65e97dbc8fc822c2073d36ff936cd47f8a')}, text='\"It had never played such a major role in the polls.

All-rounder Marcus Stoinis was dropped on 30 by Yuzvendra Chahal, after which he went on to score a 26-ball 53 and power the Capitals to 196 for four at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Monday. Kohli himself had dropped KL Rahul twice in RCB’s loss to Kings XI Punjab earlier in the tournament. “Those important chances in between, we need to grab when the opportunity comes our way. It is not like we are dropping half chances, we are dropping sitters and those things hurt you,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony. “We got into the game after the first six and then Stoinis batted really well in the end, we gave him a life, he took the game away from us,” he added. Delhi were off to a flying start with openers Prithvi Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan adding 68 runs. The RCB bowlers were able to pull things back, picking up quick wickets before slipping again. “I think they got off to a great start in the first six then we pulled it back in the next eight overs and the last phase again got away from us,” Kohli said. RCB have won three of their five matches. However, both their losses have come while chasing big targets. “I think it is about rectifying those small mistakes. The conversation around chasing is always to have a big partnership, with the dew setting in had we kept 7-8 wickets at the end of 10 overs, the game would have been on,” Kohli said. Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer was delighted with his team’s all-round performance. “Our strategy was to be fearless and play with full freedom. We have got good youngsters in our side, so we just need to go out and execute our talent and skills. I am very happy with the way things are going so far, and we need to keep up the momentum,” Iyer said. “It is important for us to get a good recovery. It isn’t easy going back into the bio bubble, so we try to spend time with each other and that is working really well for us,” he added. Axer Patel (2/18), who came in to the side in place of the injured Amit Mishra, played a vital role in his side’s victory and was adjudged the Man of the Match. “I knew it was stopping on the wicket. I knew I would bowl in the Powerplay and I had practised for it as well. I executed my plans really well. “My plan after speaking to batsmen was that since the wicket was slow, I wanted to bowl at the stumps and vary the pace. “In the Powerplay I was in a mood to defend at first, but when the third ball spun I changed gears and got into an attack mode,” he said.

After a nail-biting election day that extended by nearly a week, Democrat Joe Biden finally won the mantle of the 46th president of the United States of America on Saturday, 7 November, after a victory in Pennsylvania. Soon after the victory, Biden took to Twitter to say, “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country”. The Biden Campaign also released a statement from the president-elect on Saturday, in which he said, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.” Several US networks projected Biden as having won the presidential race after securing the key battleground of Pennsylvania, which helped him cross the 270 votes needed to win. With 20 electoral votes from the state, Biden now has a total of 273 electoral votes. He ran for president in 1988 but withdrew after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British leader Neil Kinnock. Biden ran for the presidency again in 2008 but later withdrew from the race. The candidates had been locked in a virtual dead heat for days, and\\xa0 reported that Trump’s chances of winning a second term depended on his ability to hang on to his leads in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania. However, Biden narrowed the gap in both states as vote counting progressed, finally winning Pennsylvania with 49.7 percent of the vote, as opposed to Trump’s 49.2 percent. Once he had gained ground in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia on Thursday he got to closer to defeating President Trump. “Democracy is sometimes messy. It sometimes requires a little patience as well.

The vote came days after the state said it would contribute to a 4 billion euro (US$4.76 billion) recapitalisation of Air France, more than doubling its stake in the flagship carrier, to shore up its finances after over a year of COVID-19 travel curbs. Industry Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher dismissed criticism from the aviation industry that a pandemic recovery was not the time to ban some domestic flights, and said there was no contradiction between the bailout and the climate Bill. \"We know that aviation is a contributor of carbon dioxide and that because of climate change we must reduce emissions,\" she told Europe 1 radio. \"Equally, we must support our companies and not let them fall by the wayside.\" Air traffic may not return to pre-crisis levels before 2024, McKinsey analysts forecast.

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming . BHG Holdings also reported a 40\\xa0to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened\\xa0operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods,\\xa0to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours. \\xa0 The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners.\\xa0Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made\\xa0business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.\\xa0 From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020.

Although retail rent is\\xa0expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail\\xa0balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.\\xa0 Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use\\xa0real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return\\xa0to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as\\xa0Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm. Perhaps it also\\xa0knows not keeping up risks losing loyal customers to competing malls.\", start_char_idx=4114, end_char_idx=7498, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='9467a21c-e38d-44a3-b0d8-184d91aad08a', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/maharashtra-opens-places-of-religious-worship/', 'title': 'Maharashtra opens places of religious worship', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ad04faf9-08f2-4192-b8a4-52241d76b49c', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/maharashtra-opens-places-of-religious-worship/', 'title': 'Maharashtra opens places of religious worship', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='e44843e5328b41ce8add5073868073d190cb85eb7c3b5d187810f7d5199482dd'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='bda99d27-f928-4d19-b800-96fd5fff7230', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'Business', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/orchard-road-hours-operating-shorter-why-which-malls-stores-14537496', 'title': 'Commentary: Why shopping hours in some Orchard Road malls and retailers are changing', 'published_date': '11 Apr 2021 06:00AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, hash='8256cbbbed6b5dc0bed654454e9c6a14eb3a2a3186e8c9ae067ac0bda25f8f79'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='529ee819-0743-4beb-ad6c-1d8752cfcc5f', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='08243d7881124c450656a72fc36cfce52ffc0cef1a24c898e0eecc5afcd26214')}, text='Maharashtra, which were shut since the imposition of COVID-19 lockdown in March, reopened on Monday with devotees visiting some of the prominent temples and shrines in the state. The reopening of the places of worship in Maharashtra coincided with the Diwali ‘Padwa’, which is an important festival in the state. Early in the morning, devotees were seen visiting Lord Vitthal’s temple at Pandharpur in Satara, Saibaba’s shrine in Shirdi, Goddess Tulja Bhavani’s temple in Osmanabad and the famous Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai. The Siddhivinayak temple’s chairman Aadesh Bandekar on Sunday said only 1,000 devotees will be allowed inside the temple every day in staggered time slots to be booked through a mobile phone application. As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the state government, religious places located out of COVID-19 containment zones have been allowed to reopen as per the timings decided by authorities, and devotees will be allowed inside in a staggered manner. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced reopening of the places of worship, but also cautioned people, saying it cannot be forgotten that the “demon of coronavirus” still persists and called for following discipline. The opposition BJP in the state had been seeking reopening of the places of worship and earlier questioned the Thackeray governments decision to not reopen temples at a time when bars were allowed to reopen. The chief minister, however, had defended his decision saying it was difficult to follow physical distancing at the places of worship. The issue had also led to a stand-off between Thackeray and state Governor B S Koshyari, who reminded the Shiv Sena president of his Hindutva credentials and asked if he had turned secular. Koshyari’s letter to the chief minister was criticised by constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Thackeray had said that after places of worship are reopened, rules and safety protocols have to be followed strictly, and laid stress on wearing masks. “If we follow discipline, we will get God’s blessings,” Thackeray had said. According to the SOPs laid down by the government, only asymptomatic people will be allowed inside places of worship and wearing of face mask is mandatory for devotees. The number of people to be allowed inside such places in a particular time slot will be decided on the size of the structure and ventilation. Devotees will have to maintain social distancing, while management of such places will have to conduct thermal scanning and make available hand wash or sanitisers, according to the SOPs. Local authorities of Maharashtra can further add any directions to these guidelines taking into consideration local conditions. Footwear should be preferably taken off inside vehicles, the guidelines said. Touching of statues, holy books, idols is not allowed and large gatherings continue to remain prohibited. In view of the potential threat of spread of the coronavirus infection, only recorded devotional music should be played, and choir or singing groups are not allowed, as per the SOPs. Among other guidelines, common prayer mats should be avoided and devotees should bring their own prayer mats or pieces of cloth, which they can take back with them. Physical offering of ‘prasad’, distribution or sprinkling of holy water is not allowed. Floors at places of worship should be cleaned multiple times in a day, and community kitchens and ‘langars’ should follow physical distancing, the guidelines said. Effective sanitisation of the premises should be done with a particular focus on lavatories, and hand and foot washing stations. Workers at places of worship will have to undergo pre-joining and weekly COVID-19 tests for highly exposed groups, as per the SOPs.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3775, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='529ee819-0743-4beb-ad6c-1d8752cfcc5f', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/89-lakh-covid-cases-in-india-with-93-52-per-cent-recovery/', 'title': '89-Lakh Covid cases in India with 93.52 per cent recovery', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3bb5ff8f-a7d9-40aa-841d-75eb19c5fe32', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/89-lakh-covid-cases-in-india-with-93-52-per-cent-recovery/', 'title': '89-Lakh Covid cases in India with 93.52 per cent recovery', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='29f6c0febb58f0fd373812a4cb2f6c0f30861f276dcbe8d4b5c516754ad96f5a'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='9467a21c-e38d-44a3-b0d8-184d91aad08a', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/maharashtra-opens-places-of-religious-worship/', 'title': 'Maharashtra opens places of religious worship', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='e44843e5328b41ce8add5073868073d190cb85eb7c3b5d187810f7d5199482dd'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='29bfffef-bf9d-45a0-979f-52a13db8f60e', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='ac37fba231f3b214dc866928d4c6cbabd0426d92dc9ef67c428c997396a41a9d')}, text='India’s COVID-19 caseload went past 89 lakh, while the number of people who have recuperated from the disease crossed 83 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 93.52 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday.

The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to prepare for the launch of such workplace vaccination. According to news agency , Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries said a substantial proportion of the population aged 45 years and above is in the organised sector of the economy and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private) or manufacturing and services. \"In order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations, vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing COVID vaccination centre,\" Bhushan said in the letter . He said the states can initiate due consultations with private/public sector employers and management to prepare for launch of workplace vaccination. \"Such workplace vaccination centres may be launched across states/Union Territories from 11 April, 2021,\" he said. The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to make adequate preparations and issued guidelines in this regard. According to the government\\'s guidance note, workplace vaccination sessions may be organised to facilitate optimal utilization of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage. \"Organizing vaccination at the workplace will not only be convenient to the staff at workplaces but also help to avoid travel and hence reducing the risk of exposure to virus,\" it said. According to the guidelines, only employees aged 45 years or more will be eligible for vaccination at workplaces and no outsiders including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination. One of the senior staff of the organisation will be assigned to work as nodal officer to coordinate with district health authorities/ private COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) and support vaccination activities. The beneficiaries will be required to register in Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination and CVC nodal officer will ensure registration of all targeted beneficiaries and facility of on-the-spot registration will also be available but only to employees of the workplace, the guidelines said. Once identified, the workplace vaccination centres will also have to register on the Co-WIN portal as government or private CVC at workplace. For optimal utilisation of resources, vaccination sessions will be planned at workplace CVC once at least 50 beneficiaries get registered for vaccination. \"The schedule of vaccination sessions can be made up to 15 days in advance and intimated to the workplaces so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of vaccination. In most of the workplaces vaccination schedules may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,\" the Centre told states and union territories in the guidelines. The District Task Force chaired by district magistrate and Urban Task Force chaired by municipal commissioner will identify such government and private workplaces after due deliberations with relevant employers. Every CVC in a government workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the government medical facility while every CVC in a private workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the private medical facility. The designated government and private CVC to whom the workplace CVC has been tagged will be responsible for the deployment of the vaccination team at workplace CVCs. All government and private CVCs are already linked to some cold chain points for receiving vaccines. \"These CVCs will continue to use the same mechanism to receive the vaccine needed for vaccination at tagged workplace CVC,\" the guidelines said. \"Some of the work places may have health infrastructure in form of hospitals, health clinics, nursing centers, etc. This infrastructure may be utilized to set-up vaccination site in case sufficient space for waiting, vaccination and observation rooms are available,\" the guidelines stated. The healthcare workers of this health infrastructure of the workplace CVCs (such as doctors, nurses and other staff) may be deployed for the vaccination activities at workplaces as vaccination team members, it said. The workplace CVCs staff engaged in vaccination activities will follow the same SOPs for vaccination and reporting including management and reporting of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The government has also spelled out the requirements for AEFI management at the workplace CVCs. In order to\\xa0avoid mixing of vaccine types in first and second dose, only one type of vaccine will be provided at such sessions that are conducted at the workplaces. While the anti- vaccination at government workplaces organised by district health authorities will be free of cost, inoculation organised by private CVC would be on payment basis and will be\\xa0charged the\\xa0same rate as that for vaccination at private health facility (Rs 250 per person per dose).', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5083, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='dd7648fb-17b5-4996-b6ef-b7304c802f84', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/280321/tn-polls-battle-at-royapuram-is-a-matter-of-prestige-for-dmk-and-aiad.html', 'title': 'TN Polls: Battle at Royapuram is a matter of prestige for DMK and AIADMK', 'published_date': 'Mar 28, 2021, 12:41 pm IST', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='1c5731f4-4d2a-4aaf-a253-5e63459dceb1', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/280321/tn-polls-battle-at-royapuram-is-a-matter-of-prestige-for-dmk-and-aiad.html', 'title': 'TN Polls: Battle at Royapuram is a matter of prestige for DMK and AIADMK', 'published_date': 'Mar 28, 2021, 12:41 pm IST', 'language': ''}, hash='a984c4fdc8e386f49aeaf3b86c30bc55ef75da4526108147ad8ab06367bbad48'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a2c85d18-93b9-416f-b6de-42f4a693420b', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'health', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/india/centre-to-allow-covid-19-vaccination-at-workplaces-having-100-eligible-beneficiaries-from-11-april-9505951.html', 'title': 'Centre to allow COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces having 100 eligible beneficiaries from 11 April', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='d9a71e8286c4883bf029922eec74faf93567394ad3f22a2c4404913f9f4cb769'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c41d71ef-c48a-4082-9241-5ffb69553b56', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='0970d1103e34633cd6d24295ea3c45479fc6c60055a92bf3b3315ba3c5b898ca')}, text='The electoral battle for Royapuram, an arterial northern part of the city, has become very prestigious for the opposition DMK, which is desperately attempting to wrest back the seat it lost to AIADMK\\'s D Jayakumar way back in 2001. Elections to 234 Assembly seats in Tamil Nadu will be held on April 6, with counting to be taken up on May 2. \\xa0 Jayakumar, senior AIADMK leader and state fisheries minister, has bulldozed candidates of DMK and its ally Congress in four consecutive elections, made the constituency an AIADMK bastion and established his virtually undisputed supremacy. Jayakumar, also the AIADMK organising secretary, scripted his own success in remaining as the MLA of Royapuram Assembly constituency for a quarter of a century, inflicting humiliating defeats on successive DMK and Congress candidates who challenged him. \"DJ Annan,\" (elder brother) as he is affectionately called by his supporters in his constituency, had lost only during the 1996 assembly election to DMK\\'s R Mathivanan, when a strong anti-incumbency swept away the then ruling AIADMK in the hustings. \\xa0 He registered his first impressive win in the 1991 election, trouncing Mathivanan and maintained his winning streak in elections in 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. His different campaign styles continue to draw crowds and the ever smiling former Assembly Speaker does not hesitate to wear the white cap similar to that worn by party founder and late chief minister M G Ramachandran, or sing a popular number from \"Puratchi Thalaivar\\'s\" films, to connect with the people. Ramachandran is addressed as \\'Puratchi Thalaivar,\\' meaning revolutionary leader. \\xa0 Jayakumar even sprang a surprise recently by playing kabaddi with the youth on his way home after winding up the day\\'s hectic election campaign. His unparalleled popularity is something that cannot be underestimated, but rival DMK insists a change is required. \"It is time for change, the time for the Rising Sun (DMK symbol) under the leadership M K Stalin to emerge,\" has been the constant refrain of the party\\'s 54-year old candidate R Murthy\\'s election campaign. He is the proprietor of iDream Cinemas and iDream properties. \\xa0 But Jayakumar, contesting for the seventh time from his home turf, is confident of emerging victorious this time too. Despite its mixed bag of communities, traffic woes of residents of Royapuram assembly constituency have not ended. Fishermen, who play a major role in tilting the scales, are apprehensive of the multi-crore developmental programmes in the coastal villages as these threaten their livelihood opportunities. \"DMK\\'s assurance for a sea bridge project connecting Chennai Port-Thiruvottriyur to eliminate traffic congestion and fasten commercial access to and out of the port is not needed. This will only corrode the livelihood opportunities of the fisher folk,\" says Bharathi Ku, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association (SIFWA). \\xa0 \"What we need is livelihood protection initiatives, not multi-crore projects that eat into our villages,\" he argues. The fishermen are also opposed to establishing desalination plants in the coastal villages. \"The ever increasing population and floating population of at least 50,000 people on an average per day into Royapuram for trading and other activities makes this constituency prone to frequent traffic snarls,besides taxing existing resources,\" 60-year old Jayakumar, who hails from the fishing community, told P T I. \\xa0 Despite being a small area, the density of population is high and streets are narrow in Royapuram. Not less than 3,500 autos make sorties into Royapuram on any given day, Jayakumar, who is also an advocate, claims. \"So this calls for implementing a master plan to meet the increasing requirements of the people.

The party’s bond with corporate America, however, is fraying. Fissures have burst open over the GOP’s embrace of conspiracy theories and rejection of mainstream climate science, as well as its dismissal of the 2020 election outcome.

Republicans were furious. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned that their actions were\\xa0 \\xa0GOP strategists argued that they no longer needed corporate America’s money to win elections as they try to rebrand as a party of blue-collar workers. That extends an opportunity to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats to find an ally in an unlikely place when the party has unified control of the federal government for the first time in a decade. Biden is pushing an ambitious $2.3 trillion infrastructure package that includes corporate tax increases — which the White House is characterizing to CEOs as upfront investments that will ultimately make companies more profitable. “It’s important for making the country more competitive,” said Cedric Richmond, the White House’s director of public engagement. “We think the plan is so important to the country that we are advocating and singing its praises to all businesses.” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo estimates she has talked to more than 50 business leaders about the plan, including a round of Easter weekend phone calls. She is encouraging companies to focus on the entire package instead of the tax increases. “You can’t look at one piece of it and say that one number makes you walk away,” she said. “They say, ‘That’s fair. Let me think about it.’ That’s how they run their businesses.” Whether the corporate split with the GOP widens could help answer questions about the political direction of the country and the extent to which business can continue to influence Washington. “Nobody in the business community wants hostile communities, angry finger-pointing workforces and turbulent shareholder bases,” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management. “It makes your job so much harder to have every constituency group at war within themselves, which has become the hallmark of the GOP.” Corporate America’s marriage with Republicans has long been one of convenience, united by a belief in low taxes and the need to repeal regulations. But the relationship, already strained during Donald Trump’s presidency, has come under increasing pressure as companies take cultural stands. That Republicans and businesses report to increasingly distinct constituencies helps explain the tension. A solid majority of Republican voters are white (86%) and older than 50 (62%), according to APVoteCast, a national survey of the 2020 electorate. Yet figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that workers are more racially diverse and younger than the Republican base. James Bailey, a management professor at George Washington University, published an analysis last year that suggested people who identified as Democrats cared more about a company’s political activity than Republicans do. Of business people, he said the uproar over the Georgia voting law “is a great opportunity for them to get on board with the young socially active consumer and to do so without much cost.” Just as important, Democratic counties have become the primary engines for growth. The counties that backed Biden last year account for 71% of all U.S. economic activity, according to the Brookings Institution. Democrats say business are comfortable partnering with them to address longstanding issues such as infrastructure after a decade of congressional gridlock, even though companies dislike the possibility of footing the bill. “Responsible corporate leaders want economic growth and predictable, competent policy— that’s what Democrats are offering.” said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who is running the House Democrats’ campaign arm for the 2022 midterm elections. Many Republicans are exasperated by business’s efforts to woo consumers through liberal social politics. “They are never going to satisfy the demands of the left,” said Steven Law, a former attorney for the Chamber who now runs Senate Leadership Fund, a big-spending outside group aligned with McConnell.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4762, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='deeea953-d0e2-4e00-bc59-1a952058dc29', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.huffpost.com', 'section': 'NEWS', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/corporate-america-bond-with-republican-party-frays_n_607314cbc5b6616dcd79d4b0', 'title': \"Corporate America's Bond With Republican Party Frays In Post-Trump Era\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='57e3a7c8-2d2e-4b33-971e-af9bca574bc3', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.huffpost.com', 'section': 'NEWS', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/corporate-america-bond-with-republican-party-frays_n_607314cbc5b6616dcd79d4b0', 'title': \"Corporate America's Bond With Republican Party Frays In Post-Trump Era\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='853116c83fdb8f390e6ce95033d8f130ef5a13ca911526fb7b2b05acbc30f149'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4370ab10-9b08-490b-acba-54001a0f9e7b', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.huffpost.com', 'section': 'NEWS', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/corporate-america-bond-with-republican-party-frays_n_607314cbc5b6616dcd79d4b0', 'title': \"Corporate America's Bond With Republican Party Frays In Post-Trump Era\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='12eae2719d1e744cb79e74b8f76af73435ddf51ea89798a15e4b37867ecdbf2a'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6215cfa5-54cd-4137-929c-85cb03402d50', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='8549e7dd6f5b24c0e91c6e1b2b8355c3b14845adac42ad020a7b176ca1c8d52d')}, text='Meantime “they risk alienating their natural allies in the Republican Party.” Still, Republicans have been a major driver of the rift, looking to capitalize on the culture clash to turn out the party base in the next election. Early indicators suggest business could face blowback. Georgia’s Republican-controlled House voted to strip Delta of a tax break worth tens of millions of dollars annually for its criticism of the new restrictive law, which voting rights groups have excoriated as an attack on democracy. The intended punishment was rendered moot after the GOP Senate failed to take it up before the legislative session adjourned. Campaign finance disclosures suggest corporate America’s money doesn’t buy as much influence as it once did. Roughly a decade ago, donations from company-sponsored political action committees accounted for an important share of the fundraising pie. But it’s stagnated as a source of campaign cash, as court rulings enabled wealthy GOP activists to pour money into the political system. Just 10 GOP megadonors account for half of the giving to major super political action committees controlled by Republican congressional leaders since 2012, collectively pouring $541 million into the committees, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of donors who gave over $1,000. The megadonors also contributed twice as much as conventional PACs and other groups that represent a broad swath of corporate interests. Political spending by the Chamber has also dropped precipitously. After spending $29 million in 2016, mostly supporting Republicans and attacking Democrats, the group’s contributions dropped to $10.9 million in 2018, according to data from nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. In 2020,\\xa0 , which Republicans saw as a betrayal. That’s diminished the group’s once unassailable standing with GOP congressional leaders. “There is absolutely no love lost for corporations, especially when they consistently weigh in on things they don’t understand,” said Josh Holmes, a political adviser to McConnell. “There’s no sympathy.” Common ground still exists between Republicans and business on the value of tax cuts. The Chamber and the Business Roundtable oppose raising the corporate rate to 28% from the 21% level set in 2017, as well as an enhanced global minimum tax. Yet both groups want government spending on infrastructure. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s chief policy officer, said the broader business community isn’t fully aligned with either party. But the hyperpartisan nature of today’s politics is creating pressure to choose one side. “It really causes people to want to sort everything into a red camp or a blue camp,” he said. “Businesses aren’t partisan. They aren’t Republicans or Democrats.

Its UK counterpart, however, said it would offer people under 30 the choice of another product. The European Medicines Agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. It said most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination — but based on the currently available evidence, it was not able to identify specific risk factors. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the United Kingdom, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. “The reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine,” said Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director. But it placed no new age restrictions on using the vaccine in people 18 and over, as some countries have done. “The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects.,” Cooke said. Dr. June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, echoed that sentiment, saying that the benefits “continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.” She called the unusual clots a “potential side effect” of the vaccine and said the evidence was “firming up,” but more study was needed to be sure. The EMA, the World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots. The announcements could have far-reaching effects on the use of the shot that is key to global efforts to end the pandemic. The EMA's investigation was particularly focused on two types of rare blood clots: one that appears in multiple blood vessels and another that occurs in a vein that drains blood from the brain. It also evaluated reports of people who had low levels of blood platelets, which puts them at risk of severe bleeding. As recently as last week, the EMA said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population” — a response to several countries doing just that — though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected. In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine. Meanwhile, Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, never suspended use of the vaccine. The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic. Dr Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine globally could have serious consequences. “We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said. That’s because the vaccine is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries. It has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine. The governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region had said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot. “If they do like Germany, and allow Astra Zeneca only to people over 65, that would be absurd.

Put yourself in the place of citizens, it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters on Wednesday. The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary. “If there are in fact individuals of a certain age group that could have a higher risk (of clotting) then we need to adjust its use,” Casado told Spanish public radio. “We are not questioning AstraZeneca. We need all the vaccines possible to reach the goal of 70% of the adult population.” French health authorities said they, too, were awaiting EMA’s conclusions and would follow the agency’s recommendations, especially for the 500,000 people who have received the first dose of AstraZeneca. Even officials in Asia said they were keen to hear the EMA's decision. On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said it would also pause a vaccine rollout to school nurses and teachers that was to begin on Thursday while awaiting the outcome of the EMA’s review. English, the former chair of a British Medical Association committee, said that even rare, serious side effects are seen with established vaccines and that policymakers often decide that bigger public health goals warrant their use, citing the polio vaccine as an example. For every million doses that are given of the oral polio vaccine, about one child is paralyzed from the live virus contained in the vaccine. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which developed the vaccine, paused a study of the shot in children while the U.K. regulator evaluates the link between the shot and rare blood clots in adults.\", start_char_idx=4378, end_char_idx=6421, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='aa75634e-cafa-4676-a0cd-7099a9bd5994', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/four-suspected-terrorists-killed-in-an-encounter-in-jk/', 'title': 'Four suspected terrorists killed in an encounter in J&K', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='39a8a2f2-4f9b-42d9-8d71-3ce8f6579ef9', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asian-times.com', 'section': 'information', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asian-times.com/four-suspected-terrorists-killed-in-an-encounter-in-jk/', 'title': 'Four suspected terrorists killed in an encounter in J&K', 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='9dd1126b80e9b339fde7f1e5f17c6933c8f5fe45be608fc2703f2a3d4109cde3'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='82a03882-00d7-4571-bf78-dbb621297ea3', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'health', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/health/astrazeneca-vaccine-eu-regulator-confirms-unusual-blood-clots-as-very-rare-side-effect-but-says-jab-still-safe-9506271.html', 'title': \"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='37072ef1b726773a6ab30c16e3011598ade4eb32a0468ab71ad78ad8c8c36b44'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5e5af21d-857b-496d-bf41-cc068b771a9a', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='55446b96a5a9212bb8b7c4c840cf82c899b6b69653d49e69c463ebbefcb0354b')}, text='Four suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were killed in an encounter with security forces on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway on the outskirts of Jammu city early on Thursday, officials said.

The second-year BSc Mathematics (Honours) student had returned to Telangana from Delhi in March, after those staying in the hostel were asked to go home by the college authorities in view of the

vaccination drive was temporarily halted in several parts of Maharashtra, including Pune, Panvel and Satara, due to a \"shortage\" in vaccine supply. The development comes at a time when the state is reeling under the second wave of the pandemic. In highest ever single-day spike, the state reported 59,907 new cases on Wednesday, taking the overall caseload to 31,73,261. Earlier on Wednesday, the Maharashtra government had said that the state was , especially in urban centres, and urged the Centre to send in additional stocks. The official notification issued by the Panvel Municipal Corporation read: \"Vaccination drive temporarily halted in all government and private inoculation centres in Panvel, due to unavailability of #COVID19 vaccines. Centres will be reopened once vaccines are back in stock.\" Pune also shut over 100 vaccination centres because of vaccine shortage, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule tweeted last night. She also alleged that several people had to return home without getting vaccinated. \"Pune District vaccinated 55,539 persons in 391 vaccination centres today. Several thousand people went back without being vaccinated because the vaccines stock was exhausted,\" tweeted Sule. \"109 centres remained shut today because they had no stock of vaccines. Our momentum may be lost due to lack of stock, we remain determined to vaccinate every consenting person to save lives, to break the chain of infection and to get our economy back on its feet at the earliest. Requesting Honorable Dr Harsh Vardhan ji to kindly help us with the COVID 19 vaccines,\" she said. State health minister also flagged fast-depleting stocks and said people have to be sent back due to the paucity. Tope said the state government has also demanded from the Centre to inoculate people from the age group of 20-40 years on priority. \"We do not have enough vaccine doses at various vaccination centres, and people have to be sent back due to a shortage of doses. We have demanded from the Centre that people of age group 20-40 years must be vaccinated on priority,\" had quoted Tope as saying. The health minister said the state currently has 14 lakh vaccine doses which will get consumed in over three days. But Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan launched a scathing attack on the Maharashtra government over vaccine shortage claims and termed it a \"deplorable attempt to distract attention from the failures and spread panic among the people.\" The \"lackadaisical attitude\" of Maharashtra had bogged down the entire country\\'s efforts to fight the virus, he added.

The move comes even as India\\'s drug regulator has extended Covishield\\'s shelf life from six to nine months from its manufacturing date. In a recent communique to Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the WHO has also asked the firm to formulate the doses with enough titer and/or implement a higher specification at release so that the minimum specification of= 2.5 x108ifu/dose is fulfilled throughout the shelf life. Shelf life is the length of time for which an item remains fit for use. The DCGI in a letter to SII in February said it has no objection in respect of \\'extension of shelf life of Covishield vaccine\\' in a multi-dose glass vial (10 dose-5ml) from six months to nine months. \"You are permitted to apply the shelf life of nine months to unlabelled vials available on hand, subject to the condition that the details of such stock, batch-wise, shall be submitted to this office and Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli,\" DCGI Dr V G Somani had said in the letter. The DCGI\\'s decision will help health authorities in reducing vaccine wastage. According to an update by the UK drug regulator dated February 22, the shelf-life of the AstraZeneca vaccine is six months. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the vaccine as the European Union\\'s health agency concluded a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and rare blood clots but stressed that the benefits of the vaccine to protect against continue to outweigh the risks. The UK\\'s medicines regulator on Wednesday said that under-30s in the country will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to \"evolving evidence\" linking it to rare blood clots.

Finding her allegations “completely false, provocative and intemperate” statements, the EC said Ms Banerjee’s attacks and “attempts to berate and vilify the Central paramilitary forces during the electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation among the rank and file of these forces, who have been rendering yeoman’s service since the late 1980s in election after election….” \\xa0 It also noted that the two-time CM “has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central paramilitary forces… Far more discouraging is the fact that Ms Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other. In fact, Ms Banerjee is sparing no efforts to ensure that a deep wedge and drift is created amongst them which is bound to have serious consequential damage even after the process of elections is over.” \\xa0 Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in the city on Friday for the poll campaign, tore into the TMC chief over her all-out criticism of the Central forces and the accusations against him. Rejecting her claims, he observed that he had never heard of “a CM of a state or the head of a political party making attacking comments on the Central forces like Ms Banerjee.” Mr Shah urged the TMC chief to apply her “common sense”, reminding her of the “control” of the EC, instead of his ministry, on the Central forces during the polls. He also argued that Ms Banerjee has been “frustrated”, realising that she was facing defeat in the polls, which is reflected in her comments. “She should reply to the notice from the EC to her,” the Union home minister said. \\xa0 The TMC chief, however, remained defiant despite the massive pressure that is mounting on her since this was the second notice in a gap of 24 hours to her from the EC over her violations of the MCC.\\xa0 “I will keep talking against the CRPF and BSF as long as they are with the BJP.

Through APSEZ's 89.6 per cent stake in Gangavaram port, the Adani Group will greatly expand its pan-India cargo presence. As India's largest private sector port developer and operator, we will accelerate India's and AP's industrialisation,\\x94 Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani said in a tweet. \\xa0 It is the second largest non-major port in Andhra Pradesh with a 64 MT capacity established under concession from Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) that extends till 2059. It is an all-weather, deep water, multipurpose port capable of handling fully laden super cape size vessels of up to 2,00,000 DWT, the statement said. Currently, GPL operates 9 berths and has free hold land of 1,800 acres. With a master plan capacity for 250 MTPA with 31 berths, GPL has sufficient headroom to support future growth. GPL handles a diverse mix of dry and bulk commodities including coal, iron ore, fertilizer, limestone, bauxite, sugar, alumina and steel. \\xa0 GPL is the gateway port for a hinterland spread over 8 states across eastern, southern and central India, the statement said adding it will benefit from APSEZ's pan-India footprint. Karan Adani, CEO and Whole Time Director of APSEZ said, \\x93The acquisition of GPL is a further augmentation of our vision of capitalizing on an expanded logistics network effect that generates greater value as it expands.\\x94 He added that \\x93the associated hinterland we will now be able to tap into is one of the fastest growing in the eastern region and with the logistic synergies APSEZ brings to the table, GPL has a potential to become a 250 MT port.

Though it has brought the shutters down in the country’s financial capital, the management’s Rajesh Ramnani points out they would reopen in Mumbai if suitable premises can be found, in place of the one in Bandra that has been closed. \\xa0 It may be recalled that Karachi Bakery in Mumbai was in the eye of a nationalistic storm after Maharashtra Navanirmana Sena (MNS) protested against the name of the bakery demanding that it be changed as it had a Pakistani ring to it. The Ramnani family, which migrated to India during partition, and set up the bakery, originally belonged to Karachi. However, the MNS would not hear anything of the emotional ties the family had with a city it left behind even as later generations of the Ramnanis began running the business. And the claims that it was \\'successful\\' in its campaign against Karachi Bakery, soon followed with MNS leader Haji Saif Shaikh, who led the stir, taking credit on Twitter for the closure of the bakery in Mumbai. \\xa0 \"Nothing could be farther from the truth,\" Rajesh Ramnani told here on Thursday. \"The lease period was over and it could not be renewed due to cost factors. There is no other reason for Karachi Bakery closing its operations in Mumbai. We will continue looking for appropriate premises, and when it is found, we are willing to reopen there,\" Ramnani said. Though the MNS leader tweeted about Karachi Bakery\\'s closure in Mumbai, there were several others from that city who mourned the shutting down.

Their stupendous performance in last year’s IPL earned them a ticket to Team India. Their inclusion has once accentuated the significance of playing well in the IPL. But unfortunately, the competition was so intense that neither of them could find a place in the playing X1 in the ODI team. Krunal Pandya replaced Suryakumar Yadav for the ODIs; in fact, the latter made his ODI debut against England last Tuesday and scored a record 26-ball 50. \\r\\nSimilarly, despite some good performances, K.L. Rahul is facing stiff competition from Rishab Pant as a wicket-keeping batsman. \\xa0 And with the next edition of IPL set to happen next month, more new faces are likely to emerge, putting existing performers in trouble. Ishan and Suryakumar were among the 12 batsmen who scored 350-plus runs in last year’s IPL. Naturally, they were drafted into the National side for the recent T-20 series against England. Cricket administrator and former Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) for Kolkata Knight Riders Makarand Waingankar agrees that IPL has helped many cricketers to play for Team India. He adds that the format has given the players a great opportunity to play against international cricketers much before they make their international debut. \\xa0 “Youngsters have become fearless because of their IPL stints. The situation is so dynamic that it has become challenging for players to retain their spots in the team,” points out Makarand, and adds that sometimes even top performers have to be dropped because of the competition. “Team India won matches in Australia even without Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, etc. But now if they come back, where do you slot them?” he asks. While former greats like Sachin Tendulkar, M.S. Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, etc., had the luxury of playing the game almost till their 40s, the situation for the current crop looks grim. At a time where even performers are being left out due to high competition, cricketers’ longevity on the field is in jeopardy. \\xa0 Sports analyst and historian Sunil Yashkalra describes the current situation as a ‘problem of plenty’. Commenting that league tournaments are the germination points of talent, he feels having a long stint like Dhoni, Sachin and Yuvraj could be difficult these days. “Today, longevity depends on not just skill but on temperament and fitness,” shares Sunil. He feels intense fitness will be the key differentiator for longevity in the game. “Vihari has done so well, but just one injury, and he is out of the team. And with the IPL taking place next month, the competition is even more intense, it makes things even tougher. Hence it is significant that a player stays injury-free,” he stresses. \\xa0 Former Indian cricketer and former coach of the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, Lalchand Rajput, reminisces that during his tenure, fitness was never a parameter. During the ’80s there wasn’t much emphasis on fitness, but only skill, he explains, adding that today, a player first needs to be an athlete to make the cut. Observers feel that while Team India may not soon see the likes of Sachin, Sehwag and Dhoni who played for several years, the BCCI should follow a strict rotation policy, where a mandatory rest is given to players after taking part in a certain number of matches. \\xa0 Former cricketer and Chief selector M.S.K. Prasad says that before he took charge, there were only 20 players playing all three formats (Test, ODI and T-20). He had visualized developing sustainable bench strength over a period of time to nurture the team to where it is now. “Bench strength (competition) will certainly challenge senior players’ longevity. With youngsters chipping in, it will also push seniors to perform better, so eventually, it will help Team India,” explains Prasad, who points out that Indian won the test series against Australia despite not having its seven main players.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4029, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='fd75975d-9b4e-437b-af79-a5ff8d623677', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/110421/patients-turning-covid-positive-post-elective-surgeries.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='bc4bd097-341d-4fba-a83f-519a368e2bc6', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/110421/patients-turning-covid-positive-post-elective-surgeries.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, hash='f638b1546f8c5349880e9752d52d4f1b11bea2427c7adfea2b43e27c168d58d2'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='92f8d1e1-6a47-441b-b61e-ba12a814f149', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.deccanchronicle.com', 'section': 'Top Stories', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.deccanchronicle.com/sports/cricket/300321/competition-intensifies-in-team-india.html', 'title': 'Competition intensifies in Team India', 'published_date': 'Mar 30, 2021, 6:30 am IST', 'language': ''}, hash='e761f0e3dad9ac8570f5d2b96cb951949636266f29deb62d53acc78f771a514b'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='add581fe-547e-46a2-a8a6-1f37ae639477', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='86cf8067d5b70004f8898294da839f74de5ddc6c1eb814ad38e8266e5325eea8')}, text='Patients who clear\\xa0the\\xa0Covid-19 test before going for elective surgeries for kidney, liver and cardiac diseases are ending up testing positive in post-operative wards.\\xa0\\xa0Their testing positive post surgery is being attributed to their lungs having\\xa0the typical scarring of Covid-19.

A senior infection\\xa0control specialist, who chose to remain anonymous,\\xa0said, \"These cases are being noted despite our infection\\xa0control protocols, as\\xa0the\\xa0virus movement in the hospital air is high. The other alternative could be that the number of asymptomatic carriers in\\xa0the\\xa0public is very high.

As immune-compromised are susceptible to virus, they are acquiring it.\" \\xa0 Hospitals are finding it difficult to explain this challenge to patients\\xa0who pick up the\\xa0infection post surgery. Elective surgeries are finalised on various parameters, including when mere medication is no more effective. Patients have no option but opt for surgery. \"Separate pathways in hospitals require extensive care and extremely strong protocols, which healthcare workers have to follow. In the second Coronavirus wave, it is estimated that every fourth person is a carrier of virus. We are approaching a peak. During this time, it is better that patients put off their surgery in case it is not required urgently,\"\\xa0a senior doctor said. \\xa0 Similarly, senior citizens and other immune-compromised patients must not be called to hospitals for counselling for fear of them contracting virus in the air. They must be provided online consultation for some time to come.

Finding her allegations “completely false, provocative and intemperate” statements, the EC said Ms Banerjee’s attacks and “attempts to berate and vilify the Central paramilitary forces during the electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation among the rank and file of these forces, who have been rendering yeoman’s service since the late 1980s in election after election….” \\xa0 It also noted that the two-time CM “has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central paramilitary forces… Far more discouraging is the fact that Ms Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other.

Besides Modi, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, US Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) secretary general Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo and Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud are scheduled to speak at the three-day event. BP group chief executive Bernard Looney, TOTAL SA chairman Patrick Pouyann , Petronas group CEO Tengku Muhammad Taufik, Reliance Industries head Mukesh Ambani, and Tellurian Inc president Meg Gentle are also listed as speakers. “In charting its path to a new energy future, India has captured the world’s attention. This event will expand the important discussion on the opportunities, challenges and strategies in a rapidly-changing energy world and India’s role in it,” said Daniel Yergin, IHS Markit vice chairman. Key topics to be explored will include the impact of the pandemic on India’s future energy demand, securing supplies for India’s economic growth, energy transition and the climate agenda, natural gas in the energy mix, and strategies for refining and petrochemicals. “The energy markets are closely watching the pace and shape of economic recovery in India because developments in India will significantly influence the future of energy markets globally,” said Atul Arya, senior vice president and chief energy strategist, IHS Markit. India, he said, is charting its own path during this period of transition and turbulence in the energy sector.

In Europe, America and other countries, the number of cases have seen a hike yet again after seeing a decline in the past, he noted. We should continue to be careful and not be callous until a vaccine is found, Modi said.

It is dubbed as the Chinese version of the \"Mother of All Bombs\" due to its huge destructive potential that is claimed to be only second to nuclear weapons, the daily said. The bomb was airdropped by an H-6K bomber and caused a gigantic explosion, showed a promotional video released by China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) on its website at the end of December.\\xa0 This is the first time the new bomb\\'s destructive powers have been shown in public, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.\\xa0 In April 2017,\\xa0while waging war against militants in Afghanistan, the US military had dropped a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) weapon, more commonly known as the \"Mother of All Bombs,\" on the Islamic State. Although China is using the same nickname for its bomb, said to weigh several tonnes, the Chinese weapon is smaller and lighter than its American counterpart.\\xa0 Judging from the video and the size of the H-6K\\'s bomb bay, the bomb is approximately five to six meters long, Beijing-based military analyst Wei Dongxu told the Global Times on Thursday. \"The massive blast can easily and completely wipe out fortified ground targets such as reinforced buildings, bastions and defence shelters,\" Wei said. It can also be used to clear a landing zone for troops on helicopters to rappel down, in case the area is covered by obstacles such as forests, Wei noted. Wei said that the Chinese bomb is smaller and lighter than the US, enabling it to be deployed on the H-6K bomber. \"The US bomb is so large that it has to be carried by a larger transport aircraft rather than a bomber,\" Wei said, noting that a bomber can fly faster and is better at targeting than a transport aircraft, and the Chinese bomb\\'s designer must have had this in mind when it produced the bomb to fit the H-6K. To match the US weapon, Russia developed the \"Father of All Bombs\" which is both bigger and thermobaric, meaning it uses gas to create a huge fireball rather than a shockwave, Wired reported. A NORINCO representative clarified that the bomb shown in the video is not a thermobaric weapon, but did not provide additional details, the Global Times report said.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2425, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='2f298718-7c0d-4130-b3b4-81853c792b5e', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'Sport', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/cycling-jakobsen-back-to-racing-completes-tour-of-turkey-opening-14602876', 'title': 'Cycling: Jakobsen back to racing, completes Tour of Turkey opening stage', 'published_date': '12 Apr 2021 12:30AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='d22a9c88-f6f9-4b4f-ad84-13b8ad70be9f', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.channelnewsasia.com', 'section': 'Sport', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sport/cycling-jakobsen-back-to-racing-completes-tour-of-turkey-opening-14602876', 'title': 'Cycling: Jakobsen back to racing, completes Tour of Turkey opening stage', 'published_date': '12 Apr 2021 12:30AM', 'language': 'en-US'}, hash='474a4601d649060f1aaa6c710e8ada880d7b194b41edb1fff0affc2376799299'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='d26d9871-bf99-4a38-9c70-77c2060f9855', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.wionews.com', 'section': 'WORLD', 'sub_section': 'Central Asia', 'article_url': 'https://www.wionews.com/world/china-has-built-own-mother-of-all-bombs-to-counter-us-report-188277', 'title': \"China has built own 'Mother of All Bombs' to counter US: Report\", 'published_date': 'Beijing, China', 'language': 'en'}, hash='ae448ec3cf16f0f6c9fe5c96eaed17bf25fa11c8aa9ab036f6afe3d7152489dc'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a2cfde77-835c-4335-9810-e40ce9845945', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='851e6806fe77503ac856e4c7bb80119e72988a11970246dc0d276357142a7f3c')}, text='LONDON: Fabio Jakobsen returned to racing more than eight months after suffering horrific injuries at the Tour of Poland, as he completed the opening stage of the Tour of Turkey on Sunday.

At a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the Centre has initiated the process of installing 246 oxygen generation plants in 18 states and union territories in the first phase, out of which 67 were at various stages of completion. In the second phase, 150 more such plants in 30 states and UTs would be installed, he said, adding India was in a “comfortable position” in terms of oxygen availability. “There has been no shortage of oxygen in the last 10 months. There is no paucity at present also. We are in an extremely comfortable position,” Bhushan added. Giving more details, Bhushan said the number of patients on oxygen support, which includes those in ICU, ventilator and oxygen supported beds, increased from 43,022 on September 1 to 75,000 in the third week of that month. The number then started declining and as of Tuesday it was over 57,000, he said. “Though there has been a dip, it is still higher as compared to September 1. However, it should not be a reason to worry as our capacity is much higher,” the health secretary said. Elucidating further, Bhushan said on an average, 2,397 metric tonnes of medical oxygen was consumed daily from September 2 to 8, and even then 15,282 metric tonnes of oxygen was in stock at the end of the week. The average consumption increased to 2,791 MT per day from September 9 to September 15, which was the peak period of consumption. Despite that, 14,932 MT oxygen was left in stock at the end of the week, he said. Consumption came down to 2,503 MT per day from October 6 to 14 and 17,103 MT was left at the end of the week, Bhushan added. “Oxygen production capacity has been enhanced from 5,913 MT in April to 6,862 MT in September. It will be further increased to 7191 MT by the end of October,” the health secretary said. Giving other details, he said more than 9.6 crore COVID-19 tests have been conducted so far. The cumulative, weekly, and daily positivity rate was 7.90 percent, 6.0 percent, and 4.5 percent respectively. “COVID-19 fatality rate has declined from 1.77 pc on September 1 to 1.52 pc as on date. New COVID-19 cases reported in a span of 24 hours below was 50,000 after 84 days,” Bhushan said. He further said that India’s COVID-19 cases per million population reported in the last seven days stood at 310, while the global average was 315.

The survey, conducted by market research firm YouGov, factored into the weighted impact of 10 factors including an increase in gross household income, increase or decrease in household expenses, their intent to spend this Diwali season. It found only 15 percent of the respondents with an increase in their gross household incomes. On the other hand, close to 50 percent of the respondents agreed that they are more careful with their finances today than they used to be in the past. Highlighting a strong “negative” relationship with spending intent (80.96 percent), it is this factor that is likely pulling down the overall sentiment to spend more this Diwali than last year. This survey was conducted among 2,500 respondents on YouGov India’s online panel between September 21 and 25. Further, the survey also showed that 54 percent of respondents said they were likely to spend less than last year during this Diwali, compared to 23 percent who said this in 2019. One in five (20 percent) were planning to spend the same amount as last year, while only 17 percent said they would splurge more this time. Talking about the festive shopping fervor this Diwali, YouGov India General Manager Deepa Bhatia said, “After an economic slowdown caused due to the pandemic, businesses are looking forward to the festive season for revival. Even though enthusiasm among consumers is low this year, certain categories are likely to witness demand from consumers.” She added that there also seems to be an inclination towards products that ensure autonomy and fill the gap in the absence of domestic help. “It is, therefore, important to understand the requirements of these buyers and extend offers that lift the buying sentiment.” Meanwhile, the survey stated that even as the overall buying sentiment is lower as compared to last year, people are likely to invest in categories including gadgets (22 percent), closely followed by ‘clothes’ (22 percent). Appliances (17 percent), fashion accessories (15 percent), and jewellery (12 percent) are also high on the shoppers’ priority list, it added. When it came to the mode of shopping, e-commerce is likely to see a surge with more than half (54 percent) saying they prefer to shop online this Diwali. It appeared most gadget buyers are likely to buy products online (65 per cent) than offline (18 per cent). Online also appears to be the preferred medium of shopping for other categories like fashion accessories (49 percent), beauty and make-up (48 percent), clothes (46 percent), and appliances (44 percent). However, for high-ticket items like jewelry (61 percent offline as against 16 percent online) and furniture (55 percent offline as compared with 19 percent online), people prefer in-store purchases over contactless online shopping, the survey showed. When asked what products within gadgets and electronics the respondents were likely to purchase in the next three months, smartphones emerged as the top choice for nearly half the respondents (48 per cent), followed by laptops (33 per cent), wireless earphones (28 per cent), smart televisions (25 per cent) and microwave or oven (20 per cent). Besides gadgets like smartphones and laptops, people this year also seem to be interested in home automation products such as microwaves, food processors, vacuum cleaners and dishwashers, the survey said. Traditionally, India has never been a big market for automation products but the prolonged impact of the coronavirus pandemic could be driving the demand for these products, it added. As millions of Indians increasingly balance work from home, along with managing household chores, more than a third have started thinking about purchasing a food processor (35 per cent) or a dishwasher (34 per cent) in the next three months, the survey said.

At a personal level,\\xa0I found him ruminative, soft-spoken, courtly and conscientious but, most of all, infectiously humble.\\xa0 He has chaired several committees related to the IBC law, a commendable initiative that has helped India leapfrog ahead in the list of countries known for the ease of doing business.\\xa0 In fact,\\xa0IBC has changed the whole thought process in the insolvency sector. The entire thrust of IBC is in the revival of sick businesses. Such is the impact of IBC today that there is hardly a day where developments related to\\xa0it\\xa0do not get reported in the press, either local or national. In addition to his unique expertise on specific subjects, Justice Ramana, during his long tenure as a judge of the Supreme Court, has been party to numerous judgments. Notable judgments include: (2019), dealing with the Right to Information Act, 2005, (2020) and ’s case which held that compensation for housewives must depend on the work being performed by them, therefore granting dignity to women who are homemakers.\\xa0 The judgments in and have paved the way for flexibility of appointments to tribunals and the autonomy and freedom of state governments to design their own fiscal legislation respectively. Our curtain-raiser story in last week’s issue, described Justice Ramana\\xa0\\xa0as a “kind, considerate and soft-spoken judge, who is eager to do justice and give counsel appearing before him a patient hearing with an open mind. His vast experience of being a judge for some 20 years, eight of which have been acquired in the apex court, will come to his aid in a remarkable way”. We also pointed out that his understanding of the higher judiciary as the chief justice of the Delhi High Court and acting chief justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court provided him great perspective while carrying out his duties as the fountainhead and paterfamilias of the\\xa0judiciary. His tenure as a government counsel for various departments and as an additional advocate general have given him a deep understanding of the functioning of government departments, bringing to fore his expertise in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters. His humble beginnings, our article noted last week: “have given him an insight into the suffering of the common man, which has also made him a champion of civil liberties from the very beginning of his college days and later as a journalist. He has great empathy for those requiring protection of human rights. His tenure, no doubt, will be marked by compassion, expertise and wisdom”. As the head of one of the three pillars of the State, it becomes the responsibility of the CJI to ensure that reformation and transformation continue faster than ever. The disposal rate of cases across the country must move ahead at least twice the speed with which matters get filed. The functioning of all the tiers of the courts and the tribunals are matters of great concern and requires the attention of the CJI.

Although diving for treasures is no longer a necessity for many, some traders are keeping the tradition alive. The history of pearl diving in the UAE goes back to more than 7,000 years ago. A time when UAE pearls travelled to Rome, Venice, Sri Lanka and even to India. United Arab emirate\\'s pearls were one of the most sought-after accessories of the time. Abdullah al-Suwaidi recalls how his family\\'s fortune depended on pearling much before the discovery of oil in the gulf. \"I lived and grew up around my grandfather, who lived off of pearl diving. He taught me a lot about pearl diving because of my continuous stream of questions and requests for more information and stories of adventure. It inspired my imagination.\", said Abdullah al Suwaidi, owner of a pearl farm. With UAE\\'s petroleum exports reaching sixty-six point two billion dollars this year. Commercial pearl trading has become a dying tradition and Suwaidi\\'s farm is the only commercial pearl farm in the United Arab Emirates. Abdullah al Suwaidi, also added that \"It is regrettable that nations that didn\\'t even exist in 1906 (when it came to pearling) are now the biggest producers of pearls in the world, and the Gulf states, including the UAE, do not contribute (to the trade).\" Back in the hay days, pearl diving offered seasonally if not full-time work for many local Emiratis. Suwaidi managed to keep the tradition alive and still thrills curious tourists by demonstrating how his ancestors would pick oysters off the seabed. Legend has it that once the owner of luxury jewellery brand, Jaques Cartier had travelled to the gulf in pursuit of the world\\'s most precious and exquisite pearls. With the advent of artificial pearls and the discovery of oil in the Arabian peninsula.

The team is preparing for the forthcoming IPL to be held from 09 April. As part of the protocol, the entire SRH team has been in quarantine and living in a bio bubble since March 28. Incidentally, the players have not been allowed to go out of their hotel rooms to even start practice until they tested negative for the third time too. \\xa0 In an interaction with Deccan Chronicle, SRH’s mentor V.V.S. Laxman talks about how his players are upbeat and looking forward to an exciting tournament. “The boys just had a go at the nets and it’s been pretty good,” Laxman shares. “Most of the Indian players played domestic cricket (Vijay Hazare tourney) while the foreign players played for their respective national sides. So we are trying to capitalise this entire week for our practice sessions.” Even so, IPL for Laxman has always been such a tournament in which the players have to gel well as a team. “And the good thing is that we [SRH] always played well as a cohesive unit and that’s been our strength,” he states, adding, “In fact, we are one of the most consistent teams in the last few years.” \\xa0 Having retained their core group for the 2021 season, SRH looks strong in batting with the likes of David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy, Kane Williamson, Manish Padey, etc. So too, Laxman is quite certain that SRH has the potential to beat any side. But added to the confidence in his team members’ performance is his assurance that the team has taken back lessons from IPL’s last season in Dubai. “I think overall it’s important to get a good quick breakthroughs. I believe winning crucial moments is significant,” he states. The franchise has, nevertheless, been criticised for depending heavily on the top order. But Laxman is undeterred by the talk and says that the team has players who can strengthen middle order too. \\xa0 “This season players such as Kedar Jadhav will boost our depth in the batting; his experience will not only add diversity but also strike a balance in the line-up,” assures the former India cricketer. The batting great further revels in the fact that the team has got players who can perform in any conditions. None of his confidence in his team, however, means he is blinded to their weaknesses, the mark of a true mentor. “An area we need to work on is to maintain the positive frame of mind and attitude of the players when they are part of the bubble for a long time.” \\xa0 Laxman is also convinced that as the players have been part of the bio bubble in the earlier series too, getting into the groove will not be so difficult. \\r\\nEven as the IPL time is being held in India this year, the Hyderabadi batsman is aware that the strategy for tourneys of such magnitude keeps changing. “Strategies change according to the situations, conditions, pitch, opposition, etc. But luckily we’ve got players who can execute strategies even in the toughest conditions.

He steered “the franchise into its most baroque territory,” wrote That is putting it mildly. The overt campiness and winking theatricality of Schumacher’s and have long been a point of polarisation among fans of comic book movies, particularly as a darker aesthetic, first established by Tim Burton, and then cemented on movie screens by Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder, has come to define the character. But Schumacher’s approach may well have saved the franchise. (And then, two years later, nearly sunk it.) Schumacher seemed, to some, like an unlikely candidate to take the Bat-baton (Baton?) from Burton. But throughout his career, there was rarely a specific idea of a “Joel Schumacher film”; he was closer to the filmmakers of the classic studio system, a journeyman who could take on just about any assignment he was tossed, deliver it on time and on budget, and generate a profit. So he dabbled in rowdy comedy ( ), touchy-feely dramedy ( ), romantic comedy ( ), horror ( ), and sci-fi ( ). Warner Bros handed him based on the success of his adaptation of John Grisham’s legal thriller . It is easy to forget how necessary that hand-off was deemed at the time. Though , Burton’s 1992 sequel to the record-breaking 1989 , was a commercial success, its grosses fell far short of its predecessor’s. And while critical reaction was mostly positive, some complained about its gloomy tone (Roger Ebert called it “odd and sad”). Plenty of parents agreed, put off by both the dark violence and the subtle, leather-heavy kinkiness of the relationship between Batman and Catwoman. The studio partnered with McDonald’s on Happy Meal tie-in for the PG-13-rated film but no one at the fast-food giant had even seen the film when it devised the campaign. A McDonald’s spokesman later told that the promotion “wasn’t intended to encourage young kids to see the movie.” In a July 1992 report in on the relative disappointment of , Steve Daly whispered, “Word is they intend to make sure that and its progeny showcase a much less dark Dark Knight — a kind of ‘Batman Lite’ — possibly without Burton at the helm.” That is exactly what happened, and that is exactly what they got. , on the other hand, opened its arms to that influence. The screenplay — credited to Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler, and Akiva Goldsman — is gleefully goofy, filled with corny one-liners and leering double entendres. Schumacher and his cinematographer, Stephen Goldblatt (nominated for an Oscar, one of the three nominations the film received), cram their Dutch-angled frames with candy-coated colors, neon lights, and billowing dry ice, while Elliot Goldenthal’s musical score takes the orchestral pomposity of Danny Elfman’s earlier themes, and cranks it up to 11. The performers similarly go for the gusto: Jim Carrey is at his most unhinged (no small achievement), Tommy Lee Jones chews scenery like it is his first meal in weeks, and Nicole Kidman vamps it up like the daughter Marlene Dietrich did not know she had. Reviews were more mixed for — critic called it, ironically enough, “the empty-calorie equivalent of a Happy Meal” — but audiences were ecstatic. It out-grossed both domestically and internationally.

But there, among cathedral spires and castle parapets, the animation studio has carved out a factory of hand-drawn artistry and local folklore that has persisted and flourished well beyond its creators’ expectations. When Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, directors of the enchanting Oscar-nominee , met growing up in Kilkenny — or even after they finished college and were setting out as animators — any success seemed sure to be found in typical entertainment epicenters like London, New York or Los Angeles. Instead, they decided to stay in Kilkenny with the mission of making a single film. (It turned out to be 2009’s Oscar-nominated .) Their beginning staff of 12 worked out of an old orphanage. Twelve years later, there are nearly 400 working for Cartoon Saloon and their sister studio, Lighthouse Studios, in the heart of Kilkenny. The Lighthouse offices are housed in the secondary school Moore and Stewart once attended — a very sports-centric school, the directors recall. “Our teenage selves would be glowing with pride,” Stewart says. “Revenge of the nerds, I’ve always said,” adds Moore. Formed when much of the animation world was following Pixar into computer generated animation, Cartoon Saloon is an underdog no more. , their most ambitious film — one that completes Moore’s trilogy of Irish folklore begun with and continued with 2014′s — is expected to give Pixar’s a run for its money at the Academy Awards later this month. marks the studio’s fifth Oscar nod. The independent studio now has some very deep-pocketed backers in Apple, which released along with theatrical distributor GKIDS. Cartoon Saloon’s next film, an adaptation of by Cartoon Saloon co-founder Nora Twomey, is for Netflix. Founded in 1999 by Moore, Twomey and producer Paul Young, Cartoon Saloon has arrived at these heights by doing everything they weren’t supposed to — making uncompromising, authentically Irish, hand-drawn animation in Moore and Stewart’s hometown. No one is more surprised than they are about how it’s all turned out. “People just told us we were mad,” says Moore, chuckling. “Once you put down even the tiniest little root in a place, it’s very hard to move,” says Stewart. “There was talk along the way to have an LA studio or even a Dublin office. Instead, it just grew and grew and grew.” is a fitting pinnacle for Cartoon Saloon because it’s set right in Kilkenny. The film, streaming on Apple TV+ and recently brought back into theatres, is about Robyn, the daughter of a British soldier in 17th-century Ireland, who comes upon a “wolfwalker” — a human who can take the form of a wolf. That, naturally, comes from mythology, but the historical backdrop of is true; this is the time of . Set between the woodcut-styled drawings of the British-controlled castle and incredibly lush, swirling forests, is — like Cartoon Saloon, itself — a tale of reclamation. “I definitely felt these three movies that I directed and co-directed were about speaking back to the next generation stuff that I was afraid was going to be completely lost,” Moore says by Zoom from Kilkenny, alongside Stewart. “I had grown up being completely immersed in Batman comics and Japanese and American cartoons and didn’t realise this was all around me.” Often, their surroundings play directly into the films. On a recent day, a stroll in Kilkenny’s Millennium Forest — planted 20 years ago with native trees — had Moore, contemplating the layers of sediment and history beneath him, musing about a possible spinoff. Increasingly, they’re finding a flock of animators from across Europe eager to follow in their footsteps, as Ireland’s answer to . For , Moore showed the storyboard artists the intensely period-appropriate horror film for inspiration. One artist got so into capturing the era that she drew constellations as they were in the 1650 sky. “When people come here, they’re taking a risk,” says Young. “They’re coming to live in your small town.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4051, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='2772d52f-79a2-4fed-807e-8506d0734c96', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/art-and-culture/youre-in-kilkenny-being-all-cool-how-an-irish-town-became-home-for-an-animation-powerhouse-9514271.html', 'title': \"'You’re in Kilkenny being all cool': How an Irish town became home for an animation powerhouse\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='e6563863-520d-4c52-b0cb-fd86da231203', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/art-and-culture/youre-in-kilkenny-being-all-cool-how-an-irish-town-became-home-for-an-animation-powerhouse-9514271.html', 'title': \"'You’re in Kilkenny being all cool': How an Irish town became home for an animation powerhouse\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='6a63cc7f0bc1f1d2a0fe4ba32ffa1e363a0bb5a38c6a1774517a5984e640e8e8'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c7670b9b-06ed-4858-89f0-fdbf3bddac8a', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/art-and-culture/youre-in-kilkenny-being-all-cool-how-an-irish-town-became-home-for-an-animation-powerhouse-9514271.html', 'title': \"'You’re in Kilkenny being all cool': How an Irish town became home for an animation powerhouse\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='a1af87f48c9a6d098f555456824b194da163cf44af5eb6a7f4db4ed7c9a0e7ac'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='d7f2e5f7-0703-41fd-af92-42b50a8e3f67', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='0c661928d742edb4ef0a01bd384d98bbc4942a5109124d4ee2e6135849b68438')}, text='“They’re coming to live in your small town. You better have work for the when they get here.” With a now teeming staff, the earlier, scrappier days of Cartoon Saloon are still vivid to the founders. When their first Oscar nomination was announced, for , they were in a meeting working out how to stay financial afloat for the next two months. “We survived, but it was tough times,” recalls Young. “At the early stage, the mistake we made was thinking: If we’ve got money, we’re hiring artists. I think what we needed was a few more account-types.” Twomey, who directed the studio’s Afghanistan-set 2017 feature , disagrees. “But if we did, they would have definitely told us that there’s no money in independent film. It doesn’t make any sense. You should try to be like the big studios. And we would have lost all our freedom,” she says. “I’m glad our hearts were in the right place, and our hands were in the right place.” Stewart, art director on , a concept artist for and a painter, always believed hand-drawn animation had more potential. Unlike digital technology, it doesn’t age. In , you can often see pencil lines have deliberately been left in. Moore wanted to be even more experimental on , playing with aspect ratios and perspectives. “We kind of decided we didn’t want to do more after this. We wanted to take a break and reflect. Definitely for me, anyway,” he says. “So I said, ‘Let’s try everything that we said we were going to do and either couldn’t afford to do, didn’t know how to pull it off or were wary of.’ And I don’t think we even scratched the surface. There’s still so much more.” Stewart, a nature lover, had planned this year to reach the top of every peak in Ireland. Then came a lockdown that has since December limited everyone to within five kilometres of their home. But Cartoon Saloon has still travelled around the world like never before. There’s even a billboard for on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. “We’ve never had that kind of attention before. I’d just love to have been there to take a picture of Tomm in front of one of those big billboards,” says Twomey. “I don’t think things will be the same for us after .” It’s a dramatic change from six years ago, when Moore remembers going into a cinema in Galway and seeing posters of papered across the walls, with one of tucked away. But, still, Pixar — which takes after Silicon Valley the way Cartoon Saloon does Kilkenny — remains the Oscar favorite this year with . “Always Pixar’s way out in front, and they have a beautiful film. Damn them,” Moore laughs. “If only they could have released a lackluster film for a change.” But it’s been a time for reflection for the filmmakers on an unlikely journey that led them back home. “I thought I’d be in New York being all cool,” says Moore, shaking his head. “But here I am.” Stewart smiles. “You’re in Kilkenny being all cool.”', start_char_idx=4008, end_char_idx=6879, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='d7f2e5f7-0703-41fd-af92-42b50a8e3f67', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.seelatest.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.seelatest.com/marathi/vijeta-movie-review-and-rating', 'title': '', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='384e1c57-2ab2-454f-bae8-7053933ee6cc', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.seelatest.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.seelatest.com/marathi/vijeta-movie-review-and-rating', 'title': '', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, hash='7aa8bd9b0376c9f8c0078a9b7c9488ebe70ee3f7d9b39a8980e3b5341a20fd93'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='2772d52f-79a2-4fed-807e-8506d0734c96', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/art-and-culture/youre-in-kilkenny-being-all-cool-how-an-irish-town-became-home-for-an-animation-powerhouse-9514271.html', 'title': \"'You’re in Kilkenny being all cool': How an Irish town became home for an animation powerhouse\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='719aebf931a80cf57378378bf6eb66536706fd0e5ee742f96111a5ba0dba09f7'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a864df0a-1e25-4e7f-b972-eddcc889f393', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='f3e226b6d33bf2e3d3c34c5449103b8a2c67e32a01e2608d5f21dcc4751a9132')}, text=\"Vijeta may be a Marathi movie, which directed by Amol Shetge and therefore the film starring Subodh Bhave and Sushant Shelar in prominent roles.

The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer\\xa0 \\xa0on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said. \\xa0 The US Navy said\\xa0it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state. \\xa0 The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.” \\xa0 The MEA added: “The\\xa0 \\xa0was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile,\\xa0the US Seventh Fleet said: “ \\xa0(DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.” \\xa0 It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4046, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='813798ed-976a-41e6-b388-4ecf4bc66286', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/090421/37-doctors-test-positive-for-covid-19-at-delhis-sir-gangaram-hospital.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='882e11d3-24ca-4540-bafa-0133237fb0b0', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/090421/37-doctors-test-positive-for-covid-19-at-delhis-sir-gangaram-hospital.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, hash='8b484414966489e3ba1b6f1192dbafe5072b8609b9eb923717144c55d1673690'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c4f779eb-d540-4869-9af1-c17191786196', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.asianage.com:443', 'section': 'india', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.asianage.com:443/world/americas/100421/us-navy-challenges-indias-excessive-maritime-claims-at-lakshadweep-islands.html', 'title': 'None', 'published_date': '', 'language': ''}, hash='c641194dfafea48114fdc821c02ed1b28314fd18815c52986f30b1b2f50ca8a9'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='b402ffad-4e62-401d-8a26-65f5bd1d185a', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='570bee92c3034fda6932d7589571db59e85217c34cfa79870ff866b87fb317d6')}, text='At least 37 doctors of Delhi\\'s Sir Gangaram Hospital have tested positive for coronavirus, as per the hospital sources on Thursday. \"37 doctors of the hospital have tested positive for COVID-19 while treating COVID-19 patients at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.

The Biden administration through the US\\xa0Trade Representative\\'s Office (USTR) faced a Sunday (Apr 11) night deadline on whether to take the rare step of reversing a US\\xa0International Trade Commission decision unless the companies had agreed a deal. An announcement of the battery makers\\' settlement is expected soon, the sources said. The agreement is a win for President Joe Biden who has made boosting electric vehicles and US\\xa0battery production a top priority. The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs, and Biden has proposed spending US$174 billion to hike EV sales and expand charging infrastructure. The accord puts an end to a bitter two-year dispute between affiliates of two of South Korea\\'s biggest conglomerates. After losing out to SK in its bid to win Volkswagen orders, LG accused SK of stealing trade secrets by poaching nearly 80 of its employees. The ITC in February sided with LG Chem after the company accused SK of misappropriating trade secrets related to EV battery technology and issued a 10-year-import ban, but it allowed SK to import components for batteries for Ford\\'s EV F-150 program for four years, and Volkswagen\\'s North American EVs for two years. SK vowed to walk away from its US$2.6 billion Georgia battery plant under construction if the ITC decision was not overturned. The ITC also faulted what it called SK\\'s \"egregious misconduct\" and SK\\'s destruction of documents ordered by company executives. Ford, VW, LG and SK declined to comment. Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh wrote in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that if the ITC decision were left in place, it could \"reduce US\\xa0battery capacity and delay the transition to electric vehicles\". LG first filed a complaint against SK in 2019 and both sides hired numerous lawyers and consultants to make their case to the Biden administration. The administration has been pushing the two companies to try to reach a settlement, as have VW and Ford, the sources said. US\\xa0Trade Representative Katherine Tai has been personally involved in the settlement discussions and urged both companies to come to a resolution, sources said. USTR declined to comment. SK in March received proposed terms from LG, including financial reparations to address LG\\'s trade secrets misappropriation claims, Reuters reported earlier citing a person familiar with the situation. Georgia is home to two newly-elected Democratic US\\xa0Senators who are a linchpin of Biden\\'s slim Congressional majority and have both spoken about the importance of ensuring the Georgia plant\\'s future. Both senators repeatedly pressed the companies to reach agreement. Warnock praised the reported deal that will ensure the Georgia plant\\'s survival, saying in a statement on Saturday that it \"will help keep the local economy moving forward\". Last month, Georgia\\'s Republican Governor Brian Kemp urged Biden to intervene, noting SK\\'s plant will employ nearly 2,600 and is the largest foreign investment in the state\\'s history: \"Simply put: the livelihoods of thousands of Georgians are now in your hands.\" LG\\'s battery unit LG Energy Solution is nearing completion of an Ohio cell manufacturing plant with General Motors and is close to announcing plans to build a US$2.3 billion second facility in Tennessee, sources told Reuters.

Genoa had chances to level, but Weston McKennie stepped off the bench to make sure of the victory 20 minutes from time as third-placed Juventus moved onto 62 points after 30 matches, one behind AC Milan and 12 adrift of leaders Inter Milan. Napoli climbed to fourth in the standings thanks to a 2-0 win at Sampdoria while Sergej Milinkovic-Savic's stoppage-time goal earned sixth-placed Lazio a 1-0 victory at Hellas Verona.

Scamacca could have levelled before the break, but was not to be denied early in the second period, and Marko Pjaca wasted a glorious chance to restore parity moments later.

The musical drama is set to release on 16 April in three languages- Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu. It will open pan-India, except in Maharashtra where the government announced a weekend lockdown to curb the growing numbers of cases. \"There is pressure. This is not a formulaic film. Come with low expectations and high hopes but come to theatres with all safety precautions,\" Rahman told in a Zoom interview from Chennai. The 54-year-old composer, who gave the interview a week before Maharashtra announced the lockdown, said people need to see the film on the big screen. \"There is fear... Everyone is wondering \"how the hell is he releasing the film now, is he crazy?\" But I think the movie has to come out, people need to see it on the big screen. It is a cinematic experience,\" Rahman said. The musician firmly believes that a film\\'s box office success will have a ripple effect on the entertainment sector, which has been hit badly due to the pandemic. \"This is the time people should encourage filmmakers and producers because one film\\'s success is the entire industry\\'s success. There are so many people losing hope, crying, thinking about the future. We are proud to have the courage to release it, hoping that people come wearing masks, stay safe and enjoy the film,\" he said. Directed by Vishwesh Krishnamoorthy, is co-written and produced by Rahman. He has also composed the film\\'s soundtrack. The film stars debutants Ehan Bhat and Edilsy Vargas in lead roles. The journey of the film began in 2010 when the composer decided to produce a movie. He came up with three rough story ideas and pitched them to his friends for feedback. All of them had their hearts set on one idea which eventually became \"The core idea is like a fairytale. What if a guy has to write 100 songs to win over a girl?\" Rahman said. A major Bollywood studio initially came on board to back the film but the deal fell through. He eventually found a co-producer in Ideal Entertainment who gave him complete freedom. \"We had a corporate production but I felt I would need more freedom to make the film. A panel of 12 people coming in and asking questions constantly was daunting. We quietly went off-grid from there and found Ideal Entertainment, who believed in the vision. Their excitement was empowering,\" Rahman said. Once the film had enough financial backing, the composer started scouting for a director who could bring to life his vision. He zeroed in on Krishnamoorthy, who had directed MTV\\'s musical show, which Rahman \"absolutely loved\". Rahman, one of the most regarded musicians in India and abroad for his compositions in films such as and to name just a few, said though he was juggling production and scoring music, there was never a thought to turn director for \"I was clear that I wouldn\\'t direct. I was inexperienced in direction. I am not a person who goes in front of people and directs, I am an introvert. \"I did direct a virtual reality experience which is coming out this year as an installation because it required only 18 days of shooting and four years of post-production. That I did, also because it wasn\\'t with Indian crew, so the inhibition was not there.\" is billed as a story about the self-discovery of a struggling singer, who wants to be a successful music composer. Rahman said the team was conscious to not turn the movie into merely a musical as they felt that the audience had increasingly become \"restless\" and wouldn\\'t have the patience to sit through it without being distracted. \"We had to find a way, decide what the emotional core of the film will be. It could not be just a musical. Because who\\'s going to sit through a musical in these days when everyone is so restless and wants to know what\\'s happening on Twitter. \"We had to make it a rollercoaster ride, so that we pin them down, hoping they don\\'t check their phone,\" he added.

After a nail-biting election day that extended by nearly a week, Democrat Joe Biden finally won the mantle of the 46th president of the United States of America on Saturday, 7 November, after a victory in Pennsylvania. Soon after the victory, Biden took to Twitter to say, “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country”. The Biden Campaign also released a statement from the president-elect on Saturday, in which he said, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.” Several US networks projected Biden as having won the presidential race after securing the key battleground of Pennsylvania, which helped him cross the 270 votes needed to win. With 20 electoral votes from the state, Biden now has a total of 273 electoral votes. He ran for president in 1988 but withdrew after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British leader Neil Kinnock. Biden ran for the presidency again in 2008 but later withdrew from the race. The candidates had been locked in a virtual dead heat for days, and\\xa0 reported that Trump’s chances of winning a second term depended on his ability to hang on to his leads in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania. However, Biden narrowed the gap in both states as vote counting progressed, finally winning Pennsylvania with 49.7 percent of the vote, as opposed to Trump’s 49.2 percent.

There is nothing new about Trump’s attempts to embed political appointees into civil service jobs; outgoing presidents have done it for years. (Civil service workers have protections that political appointees do not, and new administrations find it harder to fire them.) The latest disclosures reveal the extent to which Trump’s political appointees sought, in the former president’s final months, weeks and even days in office, to stay on in career government positions — a process some government watchdog groups called Successful conversions would give Trump a legacy of influence in parts of the federal government that would endure far past his time in the White House. Experts interviewed by NBC News expressed concerns over the numbers and timing of political appointees seeking conversion to permanent jobs after the election in particular, as well as about the number of appointees who had previously applied for and were granted conversions after the election. It is normal for some political appointees who are nearing the end of their time in government to seek stronger job security in permanent positions, as it is for some political appointees who are passionate about the work and who are qualified for relevant permanent jobs, experts said. But they also said that in this case, the large number of conversion applications and the post-election timing, as well as the large number of rejections by the OPM, were unusual. “You can see in the number of non-approvals by OPM that there are a bunch of political appointees [who sought career jobs] that are clearly problematic,” Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, said. “Why are these people only coming into these jobs only after the candidate who wanted them there has lost?” Nick Schwellenbach, a senior investigator at the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight, said: “It’s the kind of thing where people inside the administration know that it’s coming to an end. “Some of these people, either on their own, or at the behest of others, start seeking conversions so they can stick around.\" A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to requests for comment. The latest report obtained by NBC News also provided updates to previously pending conversion requests from the third quarter of 2020. Among those requests, on two occasions, a political appointee’s conversion request was denied because the OPM “could not conclude appointment was free of political influence and complied with merit system principles and applicable civil service laws and regulations.” One denial pertained to an unnamed political appointee inside the White House Counsel’s office who had requested approval for a conversion to be an attorney in an ethics job within the general counsel office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a crucial agency that regulates U.S. derivatives, options and futures markets.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4589, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='793bc59c-8fbb-4fb2-8f30-ca512eb11b36', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'politics', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/high-number-trump-political-appointees-sought-permanent-jobs-final-year-n1262234', 'title': 'High number of Trump political appointees sought permanent jobs in final year', 'published_date': 'April 10, 2021, 9:01 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ff54f09a-c03a-458f-bfe6-547de2765c9d', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'politics', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/high-number-trump-political-appointees-sought-permanent-jobs-final-year-n1262234', 'title': 'High number of Trump political appointees sought permanent jobs in final year', 'published_date': 'April 10, 2021, 9:01 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, hash='102ea8fc2b45088cd0c681a6728137e6dfa68b1f4866e9f7b1c03e8ec07f68a9'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5622f2f7-bcde-4973-9f71-1cc703c34f26', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'politics', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/high-number-trump-political-appointees-sought-permanent-jobs-final-year-n1262234', 'title': 'High number of Trump political appointees sought permanent jobs in final year', 'published_date': 'April 10, 2021, 9:01 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, hash='1ce5ac2de07064313df91790cd6f0ed805dfac4cadab5bc11b797bb84edbe782'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='65ac75af-a0ca-41c1-af03-62371dc5bd43', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='0c1c1422c81786b795793de7c91905460411e07bf0fbbc7093c861322c676984')}, text='derivatives, options and futures markets. The other was a political appointee within a Montana office of the Department of Agriculture who had requested approval for a conversion to another Montana office within the agency. In both cases, the names of the appointees were redacted. Meanwhile, government watchdog groups expressed concerns over two people whose initial conversion requests had since been approved. One such conversion was that of Carl Risch, whose October conversion request to be the deputy director, the No. 2 job, at the Executive Office for Immigration Review within the Department of Justice (a civil service job), was approved in December. Risch had been an assistant secretary for consular affairs at the State Department, a political job. His new job came with a $10,000 raise. His is at least the , which conducts removal and deportation proceedings in immigration courts across the country. “It’s a red flag when there are multiple people being converted to jobs at a single entity. It really raises an even larger concern,” Stier, of the Partnership for Public Service, said. “The process is supposed to be that a political appointee in no way has a leg up on the competition for a career job, but when you see multiple go to the same agency, you really have to wonder how it can be possible that the best qualified individuals are not once, but multiple times, people who are political appointees.” Risch did not respond to multiple requests for comment. EOIR spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly said Risch went through the standard pre-hiring review process with the OPM and that the agency had approved his new position. Another conversion that drew attention from Schwellenbach, Stier and other experts was that of Keith Gray, whose July request to become the associate administrator at the Department of Agriculture’s risk management agency office was approved Jan. 17, just three days before Trump left office. Gray had been a chief of staff at the division, which helps determine farming subsidies for certain groups of farmers. His new job came with a $26,000 raise. Stier pointed to that says a career job opening “cannot be created or tailored solely for the benefit of the current or former political appointee” as a reason that the conversion of Gray, who had held a leadership position in the division, caught his eye. “The fact that he is getting a job inside the division that he was the chief of staff of, I don’t really know how you do that within the confines of the OPM review process,” he said. “I don’t know how you can be assured that it was a free and fair competition when you have someone on the inside throwing their hat in. It strikes me, on its surface, as implausible that it was a free and fair competition.” The nonpartisan government watchdog raised questions over Gray’s conversion to a career job Gray did not respond to multiple messages. The Department of Agriculture and its risk management division both declined to comment. Separately, government watchdog groups pointed to apparent ongoing attempts to embed political appointees at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a pivotal agency that regulates the transmission, transportation and sale of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. FERC also reviews proposals to build interstate natural gas and oil pipelines. Half of the pending conversions from the period from Election Day through Trump’s last day in office were for conversions of employees elsewhere in the federal government to civil service jobs at FERC. Two requests, filed Dec. 22 and 23 with the OPM, were for conversions to “attorney advisor” jobs within the agency. A third, filed Jan. 4 with the OPM, was for a trial attorney job inside FERC’s legal department. The names of the people, and their initial political appointment positions, were redacted. E&E News, a widely read energy trade publication owned by Politico, reported in December that FERC had been politicized during the Trump administration. In November, Trump fired the commission’s chairman in a rare move that was viewed by many as an act of retribution for comments he had made supporting climate action. “Having political people burrow in at an agency like FERC is a huge problem with real consequences,” Stier said. “Just look at what happened in Texas,” he added, referring to the fact that that its power grid wouldn’t handle a brutal cold snap went unheeded, leaving .', start_char_idx=4548, end_char_idx=8985, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='65ac75af-a0ca-41c1-af03-62371dc5bd43', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'politics', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/high-number-trump-political-appointees-sought-permanent-jobs-final-year-n1262234', 'title': 'High number of Trump political appointees sought permanent jobs in final year', 'published_date': 'April 10, 2021, 9:01 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ff54f09a-c03a-458f-bfe6-547de2765c9d', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'politics', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/high-number-trump-political-appointees-sought-permanent-jobs-final-year-n1262234', 'title': 'High number of Trump political appointees sought permanent jobs in final year', 'published_date': 'April 10, 2021, 9:01 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, hash='102ea8fc2b45088cd0c681a6728137e6dfa68b1f4866e9f7b1c03e8ec07f68a9'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='793bc59c-8fbb-4fb2-8f30-ca512eb11b36', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.nbcnews.com', 'section': 'politics', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/high-number-trump-political-appointees-sought-permanent-jobs-final-year-n1262234', 'title': 'High number of Trump political appointees sought permanent jobs in final year', 'published_date': 'April 10, 2021, 9:01 AM UTC', 'language': 'en'}, hash='b14d6efb11faaf42069f632219586db7f87f6185c3752c247077fd58a4b6d14e'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='10fcb34b-75c9-4278-88ec-603ba604cbbf', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='83ccf9a7939b0fd749c6362b57c91b60555e0d65836e4dfe5a46083dac0bf1e7')}, text='FERC spokeswoman Mary O’Driscoll said in a statement, “It is not unusual for either Republican or Democratic commissioners to hire current or former political appointees from other agencies as advisors” and that “all FERC hiring procedures are done with the oversight and approval of OPM.” Rep.

This implies that kids remain active carriers of coronavirus even if their symptoms have subsided or even if they\\'re simply asymptomatic. The study was published in Nature Medicine on March 13\\xa0and further reaffirmed the need to shut down schools globally in order to limit the contact of infected children with others. In the United States, local school districts have suspended all classroom activity. This has been replaced by the online model of schooling. According to this study, shutting down schools is in the best interests of the society for there\\'s no clarity on whether children could pass the virus to others in the community. The study was led by Huimin Xia, of Guangzhou Women and Children\\'s Medical Center, in Guangzhou, China. All 745 subjects were babies and children. The age-range stood between two months to 15 years, and the children were selected based on their \"close contact with diagnosed [COVID-19] patients or were members of families with reported familial outbreaks\". \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nOut of the 745, only 10 tested positive for the virus and were admitted to a treatment facility, simply with the aim to protect others around them. It\\'s imperative to note here that none of them showed any significant illness. Additionally, none of the ten kids showed any severe symptoms. Even in the seven cases that developed fever, nobody exhibited a temperature of over 29 degrees Celsius. \"There were some instances of coughing, sore throat and nasal congestion,\" the journal news release noted, but \"none of the other symptoms commonly seen in adult patients, such as muscle ache and headache.\"\\xa0 Further tests like x-rays displayed no signs of pneumonia among the children. However, children with mild symptoms or no symptoms may still be able to transfer the virus to vulnerable adults. The worst part is that the kids may sustain the virus for way longer than expected, which makes them a harmful carrier group, especially towards the susceptible groups of populations. \\xa0 This was ascertained by the researchers based on the swab results of the kids, which had come out negative. However, their stool still tested positive for the virus, suggesting that a minimal amount of virus might be able to sustain itself for longer inside children. A peculiar case involved a child\\'s stool testing positive 13 days after they were discharged from the hospital. The kid had tested negative for throat/nose swabs twice.

If he’s ever going to prove his point, now is the time. The television executive is behind the network’s 2019 revival and, since he began working last fall to convince Minnesota authorities to televise Derek Chauvin’s trial, has seen the case as an opportunity to let more people know that is back. Early returns are encouraging: The network says the number of live streams of programming during the first week of the former Minneapolis police officer’s trial for the murder of George Floyd was 20 times what it was pre-trial. “When you say , everyone knows who you are,” said Tufts, the network’s senior vice president. “But when you launch a new network, people have to find you.” Originally started by journalist Steven Brill in 1991, became known for coverage of sensational trials involving OJ Simpson and the Menendez brothers. But then-corporate owner Time Warner changed it to in 2008, believing a broader-based entertainment network would have more appeal. Tufts, who has been involved in legal programming since producing ’s in the 1990s, believed owners gave up too soon. He never lost faith in as a concept and tried to convince media companies to bring it back. Katz Broadcasting, a subsidiary of the EW Scripps Co, agreed to try. Similarly, some of the people who worked on yearned for their own chance to return, said Michael Ayala. He was a reporter for in the 1990s, left to work at CBS stations in Chicago and Washington, and is now back as a anchor. Vinnie Politan, an anchor, is another returnee, along with a handful of behind-the-scenes employees. “It feels fantastic,” Ayala said. “I cannot express to you enough how happy I am.” Virtually all lawyers in the early days, the network now has more people with television experience, he said. But the focus on covering issues from a legal perspective hasn’t changed. In prime time this week, for example, Ayala discussed a US Supreme Court ruling on the use of force by police officers and how Chauvin’s attorney quoted from it during a cross-examination. Viewer opinion was solicited on the question of whether Chauvin was justified in believing that the crowd at the scene of Floyd’s death posed a threat. Anyone who watched ’s programming during the Simpson trial will find coverage of the Chauvin case to be similar, Ayala told . Not only was Minnesota convinced by and other media organisations to televise the Chauvin trial, but cameras provide the video feed for colleagues. “I’m proud of our team,” Tufts said. “We’ve delivered on our mission to provide expert analysis based on facts and the law. So much (other) coverage is devoted to one political position or another.” He said he went into the Chauvin trial with hopes that would get an audience boost of 20 percent to 50 percent. Nielsen says the first week provided with its biggest television audience since the reboot, and suggests that Tufts’ goal may have been too modest. “It has given viewers a broader awareness that we’re there,” he said. While the pandemic has cut down on the number of trials available for television, it has provided one gift, even if temporary. The US Supreme Court has held arguments on many of its cases by teleconference, and has been airing that audio. Tufts acquired the entire library of programming from 1991 until its end, including all the old trial tapes. It took seven semi-trailers to transport tapes from storage in New Jersey to the new Atlanta headquarters, and the material is being digitally converted. It was already mined for a 25-part series on the 25th anniversary of the Simpson trial. faces competition it did not have before, including Dan Abrams’ Law & Crime Network, which has operated since 2017. YouTube is also a popular destination for people interested in old trial footage, said Larry Gerbrandt, principal in Media Valuation Partners, which consults on media properties. “It’s a little bit of a gift to be the channel of record (on the Chauvin trial) and essentially cover it gavel to gavel,” he said. Gerbrandt said success largely depends on its ability to be seen in as many places as possible. says it is already available in 93 percent of the nation’s homes with television, and also streams its programming for free.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4280, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='206155c9-6431-47aa-b344-f79fd8813b86', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/world/derek-chauvin-trial-puts-court-tvs-revival-in-the-public-eye-9514561.html', 'title': \"Derek Chauvin trial puts Court TV's revival in the public eye\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='92ea2aa9-6f0a-4c0d-bdba-b0782ca3e714', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/world/derek-chauvin-trial-puts-court-tvs-revival-in-the-public-eye-9514561.html', 'title': \"Derek Chauvin trial puts Court TV's revival in the public eye\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='5c75cf44286fa6a1ac24f3f8dd5c3a06701aba21cad32b67dd115d310b97e845'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='0273851f-7f76-452c-a2aa-05d1569983ce', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/world/derek-chauvin-trial-puts-court-tvs-revival-in-the-public-eye-9514561.html', 'title': \"Derek Chauvin trial puts Court TV's revival in the public eye\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='eabb091118e61062d08c3f5df86c99e9bb0b3f85cfa711dde75bc85afab09454'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5001b4e2-1bde-4b0a-9932-d1c7059fbe0b', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='3b317da551f8462e4e0d81a02055a45fbd60ae3af417c85b53833ea836350436')}, text='The plan is to build into an expansive media empire, Tufts said. “Everything we’ve seen over the past few years is that people know the brand,” he said. “They trust the brand and think that it could and should have a place on television.”', start_char_idx=4281, end_char_idx=4519, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='5001b4e2-1bde-4b0a-9932-d1c7059fbe0b', embedding=None, metadata={'website': 'www.indialegallive.com', 'section': 'Home', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/rafale-commission-sushen-gupta-narendra-modi/', 'title': 'Rafale jets deal: Plea in Supreme Court seeks probe against PM Modi, middleman and cancellation of pact', 'published_date': 'April 11, 2021', 'language': ''}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ae8ef23b-4f23-4e96-bb5e-edea7e072f8e', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'website': 'www.indialegallive.com', 'section': 'Home', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/rafale-commission-sushen-gupta-narendra-modi/', 'title': 'Rafale jets deal: Plea in Supreme Court seeks probe against PM Modi, middleman and cancellation of pact', 'published_date': 'April 11, 2021', 'language': ''}, hash='7d1bc80eb80d2aaf9bc7f6d4024380bd5bcc98865ceea5c0ae4bdef693797442'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='206155c9-6431-47aa-b344-f79fd8813b86', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'website': 'www.firstpost.com', 'section': 'entertainment', 'sub_section': '', 'article_url': 'https://www.firstpost.com/world/derek-chauvin-trial-puts-court-tvs-revival-in-the-public-eye-9514561.html', 'title': \"Derek Chauvin trial puts Court TV's revival in the public eye\", 'published_date': 'None', 'language': ''}, hash='dc8af720aed48b215b92966e49eefb5884f610eb7035b250f40ae4e03af83a32')}, text='The petition filed by Advocate ML Sharma has levelled charges of Cheating, Criminal Breach of Trust, Criminal Conspiracy and Corruption against the Prime Minister of India and alleged middleman Sushen Mohan Gupta, in the Rafale Fighter Jet Deal.

To administer 100 million COVID vaccine doses, India took just 85 days. This is a major feat as the US and China took 89 and 102 days respectively to reach the 100 million mark. The development is sure to give a further boost to India's fight against the coronavirus pandemic even as a spike in number of infections has been seen in recent days. A country of more than a billion people, India faces a big task as it vaccinates its population. Frontline workers, citizens aged 60 and above as well as those aged 45 years and above (with comorbidities) have been given preference in the initial stages of India's coronavirus vaccination drive. The need for redoubled efforts in the fight against the pandemic was felt on Saturday as more than 100 thousand new coronavirus cases were reported across India. The death toll was up too. As per the health ministry data, death toll rose by 794 to a total of 168,436. Most cases have been detected in the western state of Maharashtra. The state has already shut down restaurants, malls and places of worship and barred the movement of most people to control the outbreak that has threatened to overrun medical facilities and created vaccine shortages.

The COVAX initiative is designed to provide vaccines to countries lacking the clout to negotiate on their own for scarce supplies. In the past two weeks, only 2 million doses were cleared for shipment to 92 countries through the program, the same amount injected in Britain alone. Internal World Health Organization documents obtained by say uncertain deliveries are causing some countries to lose faith in COVAX. The vaccine shortage stems mostly from India's decision to stop exporting vaccines from its Serum Institute factory because of a surge of cases in that country. The factory produces the majority of the AstraZeneca doses that COVAX counted on to supply about a third of the global population. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus says while one in four people in rich countries had received a vaccine, only one in 500 people in poorer countries had received a dose.</td>\n",
