   "text":" Urging people not to vote for \"trigger-happy BJP\", West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday claimed  was the \"result of a conspiracy\" hatched by the saffron party to intimidate voters. Amid polling for the fourth phase of elections on Saturday, four people died in the Sitalkuchi area of Cooch Behar district when CISF personnel opened fire allegedly after coming under attack from locals, who \"attempted to snatch their rifles\", the police had said. The TMC chief, who addressed three rallies in Jalpaiguri district during the day, also stated that   who have come out in support of the Central forces, \"should sit back and reflect if they would have had the same stance if someone in their families met with a similar fate\". \"I have video footage that shows some BJP leaders are speaking in favour of the central forces after the firing incident. You (BJP leaders) don't feel sad if sons die in other families. What if it had happened to someone in your family,\" Banerjee said in Rajganj. Hitting out at the accused CISF personnel, she said, \"If you think someone is causing nuisance, speak to him, you also have lathis. How can you suddenly point your gun at the torso and neck of voters?\" Describing the incident as \"murder of democracy\", Banerjee pointed out that the EC has stopped her and other politicians from visiting Sitalkuchi for 72 hours at the \"behest of the BJP\". \"You can stop me from visit Sitalkuchi or for that matter any other place, but I will find a way out to be on the side of the distressed people.\" \nShe asserted that \"for every bullet, reply will be given in votes\". \"Come out in larger numbers to cast your vote, exercise your democratic rights to defeat the trigger-happy BJP. The Cooch Behar incident was a result of a conspiracy hatched by the saffron camp,\" the chief minister said during her address in Nagrakota. Accusing the BJP of failing to deliver on its promise to re-open tea gardens that had to shut shop due to paucity of funds, Banerjee said the saffron party has always deceived common people. \"In sharp contrast, the TMC dispensation has undertaken many development projects in Jalpaiguri to boost its agriculture and tourism sectors. It has built a stadium in the district, and ensured that the social welfare schemes launched by the government benefits everyone in the region,\" she inisited. Banerjee, who wore a black scarf to condemn the Cooch Behar incident, paid floral tribute to those killed in the firing at a makeshift memorial built next to the stage in Nagrakota. At Chalsa, she promised ration and Rs 500 for every household and Rs 1,000 monthly allowance for the backward caste families. She further said that the TMC, if re-elected to power, will launch a state-sponsored credit card scheme for students willing to pursue higher education. Later in the day, she held a roadshow in Purba Bardhaman district. The TMC supremo, still confined to a wheelchair owing to the injuries she sustained last month, waved at people who descended on G T road in thousands to greet her. Supporters of her party chanted 'Mamata Banerjee Zindabad' and 'BJP hatao, desh bnachao' (oust BJP, save country), as the roadshow inched forward on the crowded streets of the Bardhaman town.",

   "text":"The Maharashtra unit of the Congress will hold protest against the BJP-ruled Centre from Monday by beating plates and ringing bells outside  in the state that have been shut due to the non-availability of   vaccines, a party leader said. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, state Congress president Nana Patole questioned how 'Tika Utsav' (vaccine festival) can be observed in the state from 11 to 14 April when several centres are shut as they have run out of doses. \"We will protest against the central government's attempt to politicise a serious issue of shortage of vaccine doses by banging of thalis (plates) and ringing of bells outside those vaccination centres that had to be shut due to the non-availability of doses,\" Patole said. Beating of plates and ringing of bells was part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal to the people last year to display the country's collective resolve to defeat   and to express gratitude towards the health workers and the frontline staff risking their lives during the pandemic. Patole said there is no option but to vaccinate people to keep them safe from the virus. \"Maharashtra is leading among other states in the \nvaccination drive, but the Centre is not providing enough doses,\" he said. Patole said there is enough production of vaccine doses in the country, but instead of allotting them to Maharashtra, the vaccines are being exported to other countries, including Pakistan, free of cost. He alleged that the BJP-ruled Gujarat has less number of   active cases and its population is also less than that of Maharashtra, but the supply of vaccines to that is more. Patole accused the Centre of deliberately trying to corner the opposition-ruled states to put the blame of   management on them. \"The state Congress's agitation outside the closed vaccination centres will continue till the vaccine supply is adequate,\" he added.",

   "text":"Within hours of the report from Mysuru about daily wage labourer Syed Issaq’s public library being burnt down by 'miscreants’ on 10 April, more than a lakh of rupees had been raised for him through crowdfunding. By the end of the day, almost Rs 10 lakh had been collected. The figure now stands at Rs 14 lakh. A similar episode of violence occurred a month ago in Uttar Pradesh. On 11 March, 14-year-old Asif, son of a daily labourer, was thrashed for drinking water from a tap inside the Dasna Devi temple complex in Ghaziabad. The assailant, unemployed engineer Shringi Nandan Yadav, videotaped himself thrashing a boy half his size, twisting his arm and trying to kick him in the groin. Later, the temple’s caretaker Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, defended this attack. But within eight days of the attack, came the news that Rs 10 lakh had been raised for Asif’s education through crowdfunding. Immediately after the news of both incidents became public, people from many faiths religions contributed to the victims.  Many perhaps felt shame and anger in the way these innocents had been targetted because of their religion. But what must these two Muslims citizens have felt on receiving this money from roused to indignation and action? Issaq is one of those ordinary, yet remarkably secular and wise citizens that dot our country.  This former bonded labourer turned underground drainage cleaner, sad that he had never had the chance to be educated, set up a Kannada library in 2011 to encourage those living in the nearby slums to read. He stocked his library with 11,000 books, 85 percent of them in Kannada. Among them were 3,000 Kannada copies of the Bhagwad Gita, 1,000 copies of the Koran, and the Bible. He also kept 17 newspapers, and spent Rs 6,000 a month on the library’s maintenance. No sooner was his painstakingly built collection burnt down that Issaq announced his resolve to rebuild it. Perhaps his age, 62, and experience with his patrons — around 150 a day — helped Issaq stick to his core belief of spreading the reading habit. But what of Asif? He was just 14 and the world a vast place to explore when he received the shock of his life. , \"Does water have a religion? I don’t think there is any religion that can refuse water to a thirsty person.\" The generous response to crowdfunding shows that not everyone has been swept away by the Hindutva wave that has been spreading across the country since May 2014. The BJP’s vote share in both the Lok Sabha elections has also shown that they have yet to get the overwhelming support of Hindu voters, despite the rabid speeches of their top leaders and the 24/7 dissemination of hate through social media. But this is not enough. Given the immunity enjoyed by goons in certain states, such attacks will only continue. Shringi Yadav was arrested only because the video of him thrashing Asif went viral. It was a token arrest; the police didn’t apply all relevant sections, neither did they oppose bail. Within two days he was out, appealing for funds, again in a widely-circulated video, to buy a gun since \"his life is in danger’’. That itself is enough for the police to move to cancel his bail, but don't hold your breath. The Karnataka police have behaved no better. Even before conducting a proper inquiry,   and unstubbed cigarette stubs strewn near Issac’s library may have caused the blaze.This, even though Issaq was earlier threatened by mmiscreants. Since the library was set afire in the middle of the night, the police may give up the hunt for the arsonists even before it begins. While heartfelt gestures help the victims heal, the only way of ensuring such incidents do not occur is to ensure that the ruling party is not one that supports such actions. In Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena, whose founder Bal Thackeray was way more strident about Hindutva than his contemporaries in the BJP, showed how it could handle the politics of hate the BJP and the section of the electronic media that support it tried to whip up, when two Sadhus were lynched in Palghar in April 2020, and again the same month when a communal angle was sought to be given to the gathering of migrant workers near Bandra Station. Maharashtra too has a beef ban introduced by the BJP-Sena government in 2015, but there have been far fewer attacks on cattle transporters in the state, specially since the BJP was ousted in December 2019. While interfaith couples are routinely attacked in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka, Delhi’s AAP government recently issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) including special cells headed by DCPs and a 24/7 helpline to help such couples. Of course they were only following Supreme Court guidelines, and pressure from the organisation Dhanak of Humanity, which helps such couples, has worked. But would Adityanath’s, Shivraj Singh Chauhan’s or Yedurappa’s government ever implement the guideline? The handling of the anti-CAA protests is another indicator. Uttar Pradesh saw the most brutal crackdown on the protesters. Leaving aside the North East where protests began, in Telengana and Maharashtra, protests were held for long periods. Cases were filed, but the Maharashtra government later agreed to withdraw them. In West Bengal and Kerala, massive anti-CAA rallies were led by their CMs; their Assemblies also passed resolutions against the CAA along with those in Punjab and Rajasthan; while Bihar and Delhi Assemblies passed resolutions against the NCR. Perhaps the best example of resistance comes from the dance videos uploaded by Kerala’s medical students as a challenge to the objections raised against the first such video from Thrissur Medical College that showed a Hindu student dancing with her Muslim counterpart. Such defiance can only come from a feeling of security. The CPI (M) government obviously has created such an environment, notwithstanding the unceasing political murders that take place between the ruling party, the RSS and the Muslim League specially in Kannur district. Before the February 2019 Pulwama attack, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi   indicating his lack of confidence in winning the May Lok Sabha polls on his own strength. However, the attack changed everything and he came back with an even greater majority. The Modi hold is so strong that even after last year’s callous lockdown, migrant labourers refused to blame the prime minister. However, in Bihar, where the first elections were held just after the lockdown, though the BJP improved its performance significantly, it still won fewer seats and received less vote share than Tejasvi Yadav’s RJD. Mostly, state elections where local factors play a role have seen the BJP doing badly. Those who want to resist Hindutva politics thus have their task cut out for them. In state governments, where regionalism and diversity of interests reign, lies hope.",

   "text":"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will land the first person of colour on the moon as part of an international spaceflight program called Artemis, according to the US space agency. Taking a giant step for diversity, the Biden-Harris Administration seeks to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. On Friday the administration submitted US President Joe Biden's priorities for 2022 discretionary spending to Congress. \"This goal aligns with President Biden's commitment to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all,\" said acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk.  While the first cadre of astronauts for the Artemis program was announced in December, the first two crew members for Artemis III in 2024 have yet to be announced. The initial group of 18 represents a diverse team of astronauts, including those new to NASA and veterans of spaceflight. The Artemis astronauts also include Indian American Raja Chari. \"These are historic moments in advancing equity for all of mankind,\" said Bhavya Lal, acting NASA chief of staff. She added that the announcement is personally \"very meaningful\" to her. Lal came to the US at 18 years old, carrying two suitcases full of books and never imagining she would work at NASA in the future. \"If you can see it, you can believe it,\" she said in a tweet. Returning astronauts to the moon will act as a proving ground before sending them on to Mars, a long-term goal of the Artemis program.  When astronauts explore the lunar south pole, which has never been visited by humans before, they will build on the legacy and science gained during the Apollo program and carry it into a new century.In a statement released by , the proposed spending also calls for an increase of more than 6 percent than the previous year.  \"This USD 24.7 billion funding request demonstrates the Biden Administration's commitment to NASA and its partners who have worked so hard this past year under difficult circumstances and achieved unprecedented success,\" Jurczyk said.  \"The President's discretionary request Strengthens NASA's ability to better understand Earth and how it works as an integrated system, from our oceans to our atmosphere, how it all impacts our daily lives, and how it all is impacted by climate change,\" he added. In addition to aiding the Artemis program and studying climate change, the President's request would also help further the agency's robotic exploration of space, provide a boost to aviation technology and provide new funding for NASA's efforts to engage in STEM outreach for underserved students, according to the agency. ",

   "text":"For 13-year-old Hemesh Chadalavada, a resident of Ranga Reddy district, Monday would have to be among the best days of his life. His dream of meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi came true, albeit virtually. He was one of the 32 awardees of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar. \"It was very heartening to be in the presence of the PM. He spoke to us about how the youth of the country could make an impact on the world. He spoke to us for an hour. Since there were 32 people on the video call, he could not speak to us individually,\" Hemesh told Deccan Chronicle.   Hemesh won the award for developing  a wearable device that helps those afflicted with Alzheimer's'. The device monitors the health of the patient such as wandering, pulse, and BP. If the patient starts wandering, or if the patient has abnormal health conditions, an alert is sent to the caregiver and the doctor. The Prime Minister took to a prominent micro-blogging website to say. “I truly admire Hemesh Chadalavada’s sensitivity. Seeing his grandmother suffer from Alzheimer's, he decided to work on a 'Smart Wristband' that would help monitor aspects that relate to this disease. Congratulations on being conferred the Rashtriya Bal Puraskar 2021!”   Inventing was something that he took a fancy to. “I took part in Ideate for India in January last year. I was awarded by Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. Then, in February, I took part in a competition named 'Eureka Junior' in IIT Bombay,” he said. Prior to this invention, he had come up with a device that could make car rides safer. \"I had taken up a small project in which I came up with a device that could be attached to the seat belt buckle of a car. If an accident takes place the device would alert the authorities,\" he said.   In the future, the young innovator plans on starting his own company which would come up with more such devices and innovations.",

The order was passed on a contempt case that was filed by 11 landowners from Anantagiri village of Sircilla district, whose land was submerged by a reservoir of the Kaleshwaram project.   Earlier, the court had issued interim orders to the collector and others to not carry out any construction work that could affect the petitioners’ land unless the landowners were paid compensation. Compensation should be paid as per the rules of land acquisition and benefits under the rehabilitation and resettlement policy, the court had ordered. But, the construction work went on despite court orders and the petitioners’ lands were submerged. No compensation was given to the petitioners. Following this, a contempt case was filed, based on which Justice Ramachandra Rao sentenced the officers and directed them to pay Rs 10,000 to each petitioner.  ",

The US Director of National Intelligence John Radcliffe claims that Russia and Iran have taken information regarding the US voters and  influence the public opinion in their favor. Kremlin said that the accusations are raining down every day. all of them are absolutely groundless, they are not based on anything. US have put forward a baseless claim on a verge of the country’s election so that they would advance their undemocratic and predefined scenario through shifting the blame.  Alizera Miryousefi called this allegations another scenario to undermine voter confidence.  Washington has made an extreme attempt to question the outcome of its own election at the highest level. Ratcliffe, with FBI Director Christopher Wray beside him, did not explain how the Russians and the Iranians had obtained the voter information or how the Russians might be using it. US intelligence agencies repeatedly warned Russia, Iran and China. They took part in social media disinformation efforts made to influence US voters. In 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin oversaw hacking and social media operations aimed to help Trump to win election and to attain victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

   "text":"Pakistan Prime minister call on Facebook to ban Islamophobic content on its platform, warning of  spike in radicalisation amongst Muslims,hours after he accuse French President for  “attacking Islam”. Prime Minister Imran Khan also pointed out on twitter on sunday that growing Islamophobia is encouraging extremism and violence globally, especially in numerous social media platform. Asking to place similar ban on Islamophobia and hate against Islam for that is put in the place of holocaust. This month, Facebook claimed that it will update to exclude of hate speeches and start a policy to ban content that denied the holocaust. According to Prime Minister Imran Khan the hate contents are reflective of prejudice and bias that encourages further radicalisation. According to Facebook’s last transparency repost from sic months starting from December 2019 shows that Pakistan is the second highest in requesting to curb content after Russia.  Facebook also requested that maximum people from Pakistan asked to ban Islamophobic content in comparison to rest of the muslim dominating countries. Imran Khan also referred to the situation in France where people claim “Islam is root cause of terrorism”. He also said the French President Emmanuel Macron had ” Attacked Islam” through the display of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad. Pakistan Prime minister Imran Khan comments came after Macron paid tribute to the French history teacher beheaded by an  Islamist radical who wanted to avenge the use of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expresssions. Pakistan and Turkey have developed a close tie on the topic of Islamophobia. Tens of thousands of people protested in Pakistan last month when the cartoons republished  by French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.",

   "text":"Hong Kong activist Andy Li appeared in court on Wednesday charged with \"conspiracy to collude with foreign powers\" under a draconian national security law imposed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), as well as charges linked to the 2019 protest movement. In his first public appearance since being handed back to the Hong Kong authorities on March 22 following a seven-month jail term for \"illegally crossing a border,\" Li seemed in good spirits, clad in a white shirt and black-rimmed glasses, documents in hand. Li entered no plea, nor bail application, and was remanded in custody pending trial, with the next court appearance set for May 18. He was represented by barrister Lawrence Law, whose appointment sparked widespread media speculation that he was foisted on Li by the authorities, in a manner similar to methods used by police in mainland China. But Trevor Chan, of the firm Au Yeung, Chan & Ho, denied the firm had been \"assigned\" the case, saying only that Li had asked for such details not to be made public. \"Absolutely not,\" Chan said, when asked if he was a government-appointed lawyer. Li’s sister Beatrice Li has said her brother's defense team wasn't hired by the family. Li was held incommunicado for many days after his return to Hong Kong, and taken to the maximum-security Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre. His family received a message from him earlier this week. Security was extremely tight outside the courtroom, with ranks of police motorcycles and other vehicles escorting the prison van bringing Li to court. The first charge against Li alleges that, between July 1, 2020 and Feb. 15 2021, Li conspired with pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai, his former assistant and U.S. national Mark Simon, and others, to \"request foreign sanctions\" and to \"engage in other hostile activities.\" Li was held in custody in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen for most of the period covered by the charges. Another charge relates to Li's flight -- along with 11 other activists -- by speedboat on Aug. 23, 2020, while a third accuses him of being in possession of \"explosives,\" namely, used tear-gas canisters and other spent police ammunition. Protesters sometimes gathered spent ammunition to keep as evidence of police violence against them during the 2019 movement, which began as a mass public response to plans to allow the extradition of alleged criminal suspects from Hong Kong to mainland China. ' Jimmy Lai was also in court on separate charges on Wednesday, pleading guilty alongside former pro-democracy lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan and former Democratic Party chairman Yeung Sum to \"taking part in an illegal assembly\" on Aug. 31, 2019, at the height of the protest movement. Lee and Yeung were released on bail, while Lai -- who also faces charges under the national security law -- was remanded in custody pending trial. “Today we plead guilty to the charges, but we have done no wrong,\" Lee Cheuk-yan told reporters outside the court. \"This was an act of civil disobedience.\" \"We were affirming ... that we have the right to come out to march,” he said. Yeung said the Public Order Ordinance (POO), which is frequently used to bring criminal charges against peaceful, political protesters, shouldn't have applied on Aug. 31, 2019, as the police had issued a notice of no objection to the planned rally. He cited Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Article 27 of the city's Basic Law, which state that the residents of Hong Kong enjoy the right to freedom of speech, press and association, and of demonstration. Yeung said the imposition of the national security law and recent changes to Hong Kong's political system by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had abolished democracy in the city.",

   "article_summary":"As allies, dialogue must be given priority. Differences have to be settled by diplomats, not warships",
   "text":"United States of America's naval operation near Lakshadweep has thrown up many questions and in the backdrop of Indo-US co-operation in the Quad alliance the recent development assumes interesting significance. US naval manoeuvre near the Lakshadweep came out of the blue. There was no indication, no diplomatic outreach. What does this mean for the democratic axis? More importantly, is it a setback in the battle against China? \r\n  India and the US are strategic allies. It is a partnership built on shared ideals like democracy, freedom of speech and rule of law. But today, there is a new common ground of security in the Indo-Pacific. Washington is betting on India to counter Beijing. This is reflected in America's policy realignment. It started with Trump. And has gained momentum under Joe Biden. It is vital that both sides see the bigger picture. This has been the case throughout history. Alliances survive as long as there is clarity on who the adversary is. For example, NATO has struggled to define itself.  The Quad must be wary of this. This so-called freedom of passage exercise was in simple terms, unnecessary. It wasn't a message to India, but to China. Washington wants to stamp its version of free navigation around the world. Allies, adversaries, it doesn't matter. This move reiterates America's resolve. But at what cost? The South China Sea is a disputed region. There are dozens of claims and counter-claims. There is an active aggressor in the form of China. On the other hand, India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is not a disputed region. There are no ambiguous claims of sovereignty, and there is no aggressor here. So America's adventurism here seems unwarranted. As allies, dialogue must be given priority. Differences have to be settled by diplomats, not warships. Small incidents can escalate fast. A break between India and the US would hand China the advantage. Washington needs to be wary of this. When Donald Trump was US President, he was accused of abandoning allies. He wanted to pull out troops from Germany. He asked South Korea to pay up for US deployments. Biden had some sharp words back then. Now that he's president Biden is promising change. He has told his partners that America is back. But actions like this make you doubt his sincerity. The president was lauded for his push to convene a Quad summit. It was the first time, leaders from the 4 countries met. However, as far as alliances go Quad is still a newbie. It must be cultivated into an iron bond. And India has been more than willing to engage. New Delhi has repeatedly committed itself to a free and open Indo-Pacific. And more importantly to freedom of navigation. The joint statement issued last month after the Quad virtual summit was signed by all four partners including India. \"We support the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, democratic values, and territorial integrity,\" said the statement. This is the spirit of Quad as agreed by all leaders. It also featured in the phone call between PM Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden. Allies inform, they consult and they act together. Without a joint spirit, alliances will exist only in name. America has taken a risk by wading into India's EEZ. Diplomats will most likely iron out the differences, but what about public opinion? On social media, Indians are not impressed by America's action. Domestic support is key to foreign alliances. They help leaders make long term commitments without stirring emotions back home. A 2014 pew survey found that 56% Indians held a favourable view of America. Washington cannot let that number drop any further. With this move, the US has also put other allies on notice. Japan, Australia, South Korea will all be watching closely. What is stopping US Ships from repeating this elsewhere? The American intention was to send a deadpan message. Ally or not, our worldview will prevail. But that's simply not how partnerships work.",

   "text":"India reported a record 145,384 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday and the highest number of deaths in more than five months, as it grapples with an overwhelming second-wave of infections that has forced the state of Maharashtra to impose a weekend lockdown.  Deaths rose by 794 to a total of 168,436, health ministry data showed.  India’s overall case load has swelled to 13.21 million, the third-highest globally, behind the United States and Brazil. India has reported the most number of cases in the world in the past week, breaching the 100,000 mark for the first time on Monday and four times after that.  The government blames the resurgence mainly on crowding and a reluctance to wear masks as businesses have nearly fully reopened since February, only to be partially shut again to control the current surge.  Maharashtra, the Indian state with the most cases, has already shut down restaurants, malls and places of worship and barred the movement of most people to control the outbreak that has threatened to overrun medical facilities and created vaccine shortages, officials said. Its weekend lockdown will end on early Monday.  In India’s financial capital Mumbai, hundreds of poor migrant workers crammed onto trains this week to flee the city, potentially risking a wider outbreak in smaller towns and villages.  The railways department denied people were fleeing cities because of the surge, calling it a usual rush this time of year because of holidays and as workers move to harvest crops.  Many states, meanwhile, have complained of a shortage of vaccines.  (With inputs from agencies) ",

   "text":"CNN has obtained a letter from a former patient to Columbia officials that spells out her allegations of sex abuse by Dr. Robert Hadden. The year: 1994. What's more, the head of the hospital's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology unit responded with a letter to the patient acknowledging receipt and saying her concerns would be addressed-- but the accuser says the official never got back to her, despite his assurance he would do so. Hadden continued to practice for another 18 years until he was arrested on sexual assault charges. \"I am 37 years old and have had numerous gynecological exams in the past,\" says the 1994 letter to Columbia, written by Dian Saderup Monson. \"I have never, until being examined by Dr. Hadden, been disturbed by the way in which a breast or pelvic exam was conducted.\"",

   "text":"Taiwan said Wednesday that it is willing to shoot down Chinese drones that have been flying near Taiwan-occupied Pratas Island in the South China Sea, a response to what analysts view as the latest pressure tactic from Beijing. Ocean Affairs Council Chair Lee Chung-wei told Taiwan’s legislature that the Taiwanese coastguard had recently identified Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating near Pratas, which sits about 170 nautical miles to the southeast of Hong Kong in the northern part of the South China Sea. Lee indicated that Taiwanese forces would open fire on UAVs that fly over the island, which is also claimed by the People’s Republic of China. “If we need to open fire, we will open fire,” Lee said, noting that the drones have thus far only circled Pratas and that similar activity has not been observed near Itu Aba — Taiwan’s base in the Spratly Islands which lie further south. Lee did not specify what kinds of drones China has been sending to Pratas. These drone flights, which Lee described as “gray zone” activity, come as China is ramping up pressure on Taiwan. Aircraft belonging to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been conducting regular flights through Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) for months on end, including through the southwestern portion of the ADIZ near Pratas, RFA reported in  . The Ministry of National Defense   a record 20 PLA aircraft entering Taiwan’s ADIZ on March 26. Jessica Drun, a non-resident fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, told RFA that “these gray zone activities are an attempt to wear down Taiwan psychologically and from a resource perspective.” “This is happening against the backdrop of ever-deepening U.S.-Taiwan ties, a domestic population in Taiwan that has more or less rejected China’s framework for cross-Strait relations, and an increasingly assertive Beijing the world over,” Drun said. Although Taiwan is a self-governing democracy, Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be annexed by force if it deems necessary. While the drones currently operating near Pratas are likely to be for reconnaissance or testing Taiwan’s resolve, PLA researchers have written about the possibility of using armed unmanned systems in combat scenarios that would involve Taiwan. For instance, PLA researchers have recently published studies on using unmanned surface vehicles, drone swarms and helicopter-like UAVs during amphibious landing operations, such as efforts to invade Taiwan or seize small islands like Pratas and Itu Aba. Michael Mazza, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that Pratas Island may be an “attractive target” for China. “China might one day wish to occupy the islands, either as a first step in an assault on Taiwan, as a means of coercing Taiwan into unification, as a way to test international responses to an attack on one of Taiwan's offshore islands, or as part of an effort to reenforce control over the South China Sea,” Mazza said. Taiwan and China are just two of the claimants in the disputed South China Sea. The others are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Even as China has been turning up the heat to assert its sweeping land and sea claims in the South China Sea and to pressure Taiwan, other militaries are making their presence known as well. A U.S. carrier strike group conducted a bilateral military exercise with the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) in the South China Sea on Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced in press release. “The two days exercise aims to strengthen the bilateral relations and military diplomacy,\" the RMAF said in its own statement. The exercises are to \"enhance the operational interoperability and overall cooperation among the two forces,\" it added.",

   "text":"Myanmar citizens are struggling with shortages of food and other necessities after 65 days of rule under the military junta, whose troops shake down cargo trucks at roadblocks and steal goods and cash from vehicles, stores, and homes, residents said Tuesday. The coup on Feb. 1 that overthrew the country’s elected government followed a year of deepening economic distress from a shutdown of economic activity to control the spread of the coronavirus. Myanmar is Southeast Asia’s poorest country, with nominal per capita GDP of about U.S. $1,300. Measures to fight the pandemic, which flared up this past winter, hit households and businesses, including those in the agricultural sector, which accounts for one-fifth of GDP and over half of employment. The coup and mass civil disobedience against the junta have further dampened economic activity. Military restrictions on transportation and security barriers set up on major roadways nationwide have choked the country’s flow of food and other goods into cities and suburban areas. Soldiers stationed along major roadways often confiscate cargo and cash from drivers and motorcyclists in the Sagaing and Mandalay regions — two of Myanmar largest population centers — merchants told RFA. Security forces are stopping all traffic that passes through most towns in the two regions and inspecting vehicles, they said. “[Our] car was stopped last evening in Kyaukpadaung, Mandalay, and 500,000 kyats [U.S. $350] was taken from a handbag on the car’s dashboard,” said a person who witnessed the theft, but wanted to remain anonymous. “We told them we were civil servants, and they said they didn’t care and just took the money.” Similar incidents were reported in Sagaing region in the country’s northwest, where police and troops seized food from shops in markets and shopping malls without paying, traders said. They also stole goods from vehicles they inspected, resulting in fewer cargo trucks moving though the region. “It’s not easy to transport goods now because (troops) are everywhere, and we don’t know if we can proceed or not,” said a trader in Monywa, Sagaing’s largest city. “The cars can go on only when they say so. Even then, they sometimes will take stuff.” The trader said he recently saw security forces take a box of snacks from a vehicle during a security check. “Life is quite difficult,” he added. Only about two of every 100 truck drivers are now moving cargo through the region, the trader said. Not only do security forces check every part of the trucks, they also ask questions if they find a lot of cash, inquiring where the money came from and who will receive it, and then sometimes take the money for themselves, he said. The economic pinch is also being felt in Yangon, the most populous city in Myanmar, whose citizens rely on deliveries of goods from outside the urban center for their household and business needs. Disruptions in the flow of consumer goods means that neighborhood markets have little meat or vegetables to sell, while prices for the products have doubled, said one Yangon homemaker. “In Yangon, only the big supermarkets like City Mart and Metro are operating as usual, and the smaller shops and stores are all closed,” she said. “Only about half the regular amount of meat and veggies is available, and you have to buy them whether you like it or not as we don’t have the opportunity to choose what we want,” she said. “Prices have increased twofold, threefold, or more.” The number of cargo trucks entering the commercial center’s largest wholesale markets have dropped by two-thirds, while prices of daily necessities have increased, said a rice seller in Yangon. At the Bayinnaung Market in rice deliveries have fallen by about two-thirds, though shops are open as usual, a rice merchant said. The market for foodstuffs will remain stable for now, but if the flow of basic foods and commodities stops and storage supplies are exhausted, prices will skyrocket, traders said. The struggle to stay fed and supplied plays out amid live-and-death battles in the streets, as heavily armed security forces suppress demonstrators and ordinary citizens alike, often firing indiscriminately into crowds or dwellings. At least three civilians had been wounded by gunfire within 24 hours up to midday on Tuesday and an unknown number of people had been arrested since early morning, including four medical doctors in Mandalay. Soldiers and police detained the doctors as they prepared for a protest on 73rd Street in memory of their fallen colleagues. One man was hit in the arm when police fired live rounds during the crackdown, and officers arrested two pediatricians and two other doctors, and confiscated motorcycles and cell phones from the protesters, witnesses said. “They arrived in a truck while we were preparing to stage a dawn protest,” said one physician at the scene who declined to be named. “They fired stun grenades five times near the university campus. Afterwards, two pediatricians and two other doctors got arrested, and three motorcycles were taken away.” Though local health department workers and other anti-junta protesters have held early morning demonstrations, this was the first time that police took action against them, those at the scene said. In the Kachin state town of Mogaung, a woman was hit in the arm by gunfire on Monday evening while counting her day’s earnings in her shop, witnesses said. She was shot by troops and police stationed on the bridge across the Nangyin River near her neighborhood. Security forces also shot another man on a motorbike when he tried to turn around at the bridge, witnesses said. “There were five or six shots, and one of the first shots hit the woman,” said a local resident. “The last shot hit the guy on the motorbike, slightly wounding him.” A family member of the woman who was shot said a military officer apologized for the shooting Tuesday morning and offered to take her to a military hospital in Kachin’s capital Myitkyina. Local residents said they wanted the troops to leave the bridge. Security forces continued heir searches for protest leaders in other parts of Myanmar, sometimes resorting to their arresting their relatives. When police in Thayarwaddy, a city in the central Bago region, couldn’t find Jar Lay, an anti-coup protest leader, they arrested his family of six, including a four-year-old daughter, a toddler niece, and a 13-year-old brother-in-law. The six were released on Tuesday, but Jar Lay told RFA from his hiding place that police beat his teenage brother-in-law on the side of his head during an interrogation. “An informer told police we had explosives and weapons hidden in the house which was not true, and troops came to search for them at about 3 a.m.,” he said. “My entire family, including my kids and my in-laws, was taken to a military camp.” The teenager, who was hit in the temples and on his ears, was questioned about why he shared posts and photos on social media from his cell phone, Jar Lay said. “He was later taken to a police station and was forced to sign a confession,” he said. Before their release, the relatives had to sign a pledge that they would help police capture Jar Lay, and that if he could not be found, they would be rearrested, Jar Lay said. Security forces are even rounding up domestic celebrities who may not have played a part in the protests. Soldiers and police arrested famous comedian Zarganar in Yangon’s Tamwe township Tuesday morning, according to Facebook posts by his colleagues Ngapyaw Gyaw and Kaung Gyaw. Zaganar is not on the list of those subject to police warrants, so it is not yet known what he has been charged with or where he is being detained, they said. Throughout the country, protests against the junta continued in various forms in Mandalay, the Yangon suburbs, and in other cities and towns. Anti-junta protesters added color to their rallies Tuesday by smearing red paint on streets and pavements in the commercial hub Yangon to signal their opposition to the military regime’s bloody crackdowns on demonstrations that have left about 570 people dead and injured scores of others, Agence France-Presse reported. Myanmar youth meanwhile are calling for boycott of the annual Thingyan Water Festival holiday next week in defiance of the military regime and to honor those killed by security forces, the online news journal   reported. Last year’s holiday celebrations, which include splashing water on people in public places, were called off by the government due to the coronavirus pandemic. Military authorities, who already have closed the offices of deposed leader Aung San Su Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD), are continuing to pursue and arrest party officials and parliamentarians, according to residents in various areas. Security forces arrested Aye Khine, a member of parliament and a local NLD executive committee member, in Mandalay region on Tuesday, said one of his colleagues. “He was returning home from hiding for a while and was arrested while he was making a phone call in the city. His phone was also taken away,” said the NLD member who spoke to RFA on condition of anonymity. Ye Kyaw Thwin, an NLD lawmaker representing Mawlamyine township in Ayeyarwady region, was arrested by authorities Tuesday afternoon while fleeing a village following a complaint from a military informant, one of his colleagues said.",

   "text":"India, which is projected to grow at an impressive rate of 12.5 per cent this year, needs to grow at a much faster pace to make up for the unprecedented contraction of eight per cent that it clocked during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a senior IMF official. The International Monetary Fund Deputy Chief Economist, Petya Koeva Brooks, in an interview to PTI on Friday also made a strong case for an additional economic stimulus to address the impact of the pandemic on the country's economy. \"When it comes to India there was a major collapse of output last fiscal year and the number as you mentioned is eight. \"So, we are very glad to see the strong rebound this year with projected growth of 12.5 for fiscal year 21-22 and we are seeing also high-frequency indicators including PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index), and trade and more mobility indicators which give us a sense that there is a continued recovery in the first quarter of this year,\" she said. That said, there are some recent emergencies of the new variants in the localised lockdowns that are seen as one of the threats to this recovery, Brooks noted. On the recovery itself, when it comes to the level in terms of the level of output, we are expecting that level to return to the pre-crisis one from 2019 to this fiscal year. That is what we have in our projections. \"However, if you look at a concept of scarring, which just compares what the level of output would have been hadn't there been a crisis in 2024, which is the measure which we are using. Then at and compare where our current growth trajectory is for India that gap is much larger, Brooks said. The gap, she said, which is eight per cent of GDP is significantly larger than what it is for the world as a whole. \"For the world as a whole it's about three (per cent), which is another way of saying that even though in the near term we have this real rebound, there's still scope in the coming years to see higher growth which would reduce and hopefully, eliminate that scarring, which we are currently expecting, the top IMF official said in response to a question. \"If we were to just think about the level of output that it was prior to being a pandemic then that catch happens this year, which is not surprising also given the very high level of the underlying high level of growth which India has. But again, if we compare it to the path of what it would have been without the pandemic then we are getting too many larger gaps there, she said. Noting that the Indian government took several steps to address the COVID-19 crisis, Brooks said, We have seen policy responses, which have been coordinated and in several areas. We have seen that the fiscal support, the monetary easing as well as the liquidity and regulatory measures that were taken.\" What makes sense is to maintain the focus on having that coordinated policy response because this is what's going to prevent long-term damage to the economy. Providing that support to small and medium-sized firms as well as vulnerable houses would be particularly important, she said. Brooks said the IMF very much welcomes the measures that were announced by India during its budget. It is particularly supportive of maintaining the accommodative fiscal stance and also emphasising expenditures on health and infrastructure. We estimate that the positive impact of the measures for this fiscal year is going to be of the order of point six percentage points on growth, she said, adding that several measures announced in the budget were in line of the IMF's advice. Prominent among them are that there would not be a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus at the general government level and also that state governments would be given the temporary flexibility to go over their budget ceilings. And last, but not least, the fact that some of the other budget items on food subsidies were actually brought into the budget. Overall, the IMF is very supportive of this focus on growth. At the same time, Brooks made a strong case for an additional economic stimulus. We do think that additional fiscal stimulus would be helpful. Focusing that stimulus again on the most vulnerable is something that makes sense to us. We note that some of the income support schemes were not extended beyond November 2020 and such, she said. Taking measures in that area would be particularly helpful as well as making sure that there's priority spending on education, the economist noted. Last, but not least, also ensuring that there is a very concrete medium-term fiscal framework is an area where we can see some room for more work in that area, she said. Now when it comes to monetary policy, we think that given the underlying slack in the economy, maintaining the accommodative monetary policy stance makes sense. This is what we understand is being planned at the moment. This has been our long-standing recommendation that we see scope for additional policy measures to address the weaknesses in the financial sector, in the banking part in the non-bank part of the financial sector. We think that this is going to be particularly important as we come out of the crisis to have that efficient credit intermediation, which is going to allow the economy to grow, the IMF official said. Responding to a question on the stimulus package, Brooks underscored the need to essentially have targeted support for households and for the firms that have been most affected is the most efficient and sensible way to provide that support.",

   "text":"At 77, Joe Biden is set to be the oldest president in US history. After a nail-biting election day that extended by nearly a week, Democrat Joe Biden finally won the mantle of the 46th president of the United States of America on Saturday, 7 November, after a victory in Pennsylvania. Soon after the victory, Biden took to Twitter to say, “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country”. The Biden Campaign also released a statement from the president-elect on Saturday, in which he said, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.” Several US networks projected Biden as having won the presidential race after securing the key battleground of Pennsylvania, which helped him cross the 270 votes needed to win. With 20 electoral votes from the state, Biden now has a total of 273 electoral votes. He ran for president in 1988 but withdrew after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British leader Neil Kinnock. Biden ran for the presidency again in 2008 but later withdrew from the race. The candidates had been locked in a virtual dead heat for days, and  reported that Trump’s chances of winning a second term depended on his ability to hang on to his leads in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania. However, Biden narrowed the gap in both states as vote counting progressed, finally winning Pennsylvania with 49.7 percent of the vote, as opposed to Trump’s 49.2 percent. Once he had gained ground in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia on Thursday he got to closer to defeating President Trump. “Democracy is sometimes messy. It sometimes requires a little patience as well. But that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance that’s been the envy of the world,” Biden had said as he awaited the results.",

   "text":"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is self-isolating after a meeting with a Member of Parliament who later tested positive for COVID-19, Downing Street said. Johnson had been notified by the National Health Service (NHS) Test and Trace that he came in contact of someone who has tested positive and he must self-isolate, the prime minister’s spokesperson said on Sunday. The prime minister will follow the rules and is self-isolating. He will carry on working from Downing Street, including on leading the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, the spokesperson said. “The PM is well and does not have any symptoms of COVID-19,” the spokesperson added. Boris Johnson spent three nights in intensive care at St. Thomas’ Hospital in central London in April after testing positive for COVID-19. Under the NHS Test and Trace rules, his self-isolation should run for 10 days and end on November 26. Boris Johnson had a meeting lasting about 35 minutes with some MPs at his office in 10 Downing Street on Thursday morning, including Lee Anderson the MP for Ashfield in the East Midlands region of England. Anderson later developed symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 and posted on his Facebook page to say he was self-isolating. On Friday I lost my sense of taste at the same time my wife had a bad headache. I had no cough, no fever and felt well. We both had a test on Saturday and the result came in Sunday morning, said the Conservative Party MP. My wife and I both tested positive. I feel absolutely fine and my biggest concern is my wife who is in the shielded group. But we are both feeling good, he said.",

   "text":"The former army general and ex-Thai junta leader made the remarks days after Thailand’s friend China – as well as Russia – threw their support behind a special summit of Southeast Asian nations’ leaders to discuss the crisis in Myanmar. China’s reaction to the coup had been muted, just as when Prayuth, as the Royal Thai Army chief of staff, seized power in a military coup that toppled an elected government in 2014. “It is not that we don’t care about humanitarian problems – a life is a life – but the government proposes solutions to the problems via the foreign ministry,” Prayuth told reporters, in what appeared to be a defense of his government’s relatively muted response on the volatile situation in Myanmar since the military there overthrew a democratically elected government on Feb. 1. “We cannot do anything we want, because we have common borders [with Myanmar] and we rely on each other for many things. But we certainly do not agree with violence and we have said so to them, and have kept telling them to reduce [violence].” The Thai PM further said “we have to fix the troubles systemically” in Myanmar. He also noted that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was planning to soon hold a special meeting in Jakarta of leaders from across the regional bloc. Notably, the announcement by ASEAN members Malaysia and Brunei that a leaders’ summit would be held on Myanmar, came three days after China said it supported such a meeting. However, the bloc still has not yet announced a date for the special summit. The fastidiously non-interfering bloc has for more than two months not been able to reach a consensus on how to deal with the junta in member-state Myanmar. Last week, after the single deadliest day in post-coup Myanmar when the military and security forces killed 114 civilians during anti-junta protests on March 27, the Thai foreign ministry for the first time in two months expressed grave concern about the situation in the country next-door. By contrast, on the day of the Burmese coup, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan had said “It’s their own business, it’s their internal affair.” And on March 22, a Thai Army spokesman denied a local media report that a Thai border security agency had supplied 700 sacks of rice to the Myanmar Army base of operations in Karen state, which sits along the Thai-Myanmar frontier. The spokesman said any transaction that took place was part of “usual border trade.” The apparent change in the rhetoric from senior Thai officials coincided with an influx into Thailand of people fleeing from the violence in Myanmar. Thousands of ethnic Karen fled their homes in Karen state after the military’s March 27 air strikes on villages controlled by Karen National Union (KNU) rebels, who hold large swathes of territory in the borderlands with Thailand. On Wednesday, Prayuth said relevant agencies were helping the displaced people by bringing them critical food and medical supplies. “In the past also, in many cases of people affected by the fighting [in Myanmar] the military has saved people by letting many inside for medical treatment,” Prayuth said. According to Pornsuk Kerdsawang, from Thai NGO Friends Without Borders Foundation, the Myanmar military on Monday allowed a cargo ship from Thailand to deliver aid across the border. “On April 8, the Thai military will take five vehicles to help carry goods from the Red Cross and deliver them to those displaced people. As for us, we assessed this as a breakthrough in assistance,” Pornsuk told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service. Pornsuk said that helicopters and drones were heard on Tuesday flying around on the Myanmar side of the border in Karen state. She said she worried that the unrest along the frontier could threaten the rice season for local farmers. “[I]f the situation is still like this, they will be in trouble. Because they cannot grow rice, they will not have rice to eat, so we insist on our statement that we would like the government to provide assistance that takes into account long-term solutions,” Pornsuk said. “Because even if the Myanmar villagers [on the Myanmar side of the border] were given the aid that people sent, it’s not a success – just a solution to the immediate problems.” On April 2, Prayuth instructed all relevant relief agencies to give medical and other assistance to the 1,200 or so people who had crossed into Thailand, a Thai government spokesman, told reporters. Earlier last week, human rights and refugee advocacy groups had criticized the Thai PM for allegedly ordering the military to push the refugees back across the border into their strife-torn country. Meanwhile, Myanmar troops again fired at anti-coup protesters on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people and wounding several in the country’s northwest, news agencies reported. The death toll in the post-coup violence has reached at least 598, according to Thai NGO Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. In addition, Myanmar citizens are struggling with shortages of food and other necessities after 65 days of rule under the military junta, whose troops steal goods and cash from vehicles, stores, and homes, residents told the Myanmar Service of Radio Free Asia (RFA), with which BenarNews is affiliated. The continuing violence in Myanmar prompted Indonesia and the United Kingdom on Wednesday to reiterate calls for a halt to the brutality. “[I]ndonesia and the U.K. are appalled that hundreds of peaceful protesters have been killed in Myanmar,” said a statement issued by Britain, after a meeting of the two countries’ foreign ministers in Jakarta. “Both countries agreed on the importance of ASEAN as the pre-eminent regional institution and a key part of the Rules-Based International System to find acceptable solutions based on the will and the interests of the people in Myanmar.” Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said she and her British counterpart, Dominic Raab, had discussed how the U.K. and the international community could support ASEAN’s effort to help Myanmar resolve the turmoil there.",

   "text":"The mounting piles of garbage in the streets are a nightmare to residents, business establishments and motorists as garbage bins have been removed from many localities in the city. GHMC has not been able to clear the garbage that has piled up on roads and street corners. The unattended garbage spread on the roads produces a foul smell which makes it difficult to pedestrians and others to move around such areas.   The civic body has removed garbage bins in a phased manner as a part of its campaign to make Hyderabad a bin-free city. However, people still keep throwing garbage at the places where these bins once existed. Though the GHMC has a mechanism for collecting garbage door to door, the manpower being used for this purpose seems insufficient. As a result, people throw waste on the roads and street corners. The civic body is not removing the garbage piles on the roads. Garbage piles are seen at various locations in Nampally railway station, Nampally market, Koti, Asifnagar, Red Hills, Padmaraonagar, Marredpally etc. Residents and hoteliers complain that GHMC sanitation wing officials are not responding to their calls.   Nampally MLA Jafar Hussain Meraj wrote a letter to GHMC commissioner and requested him to clear the garbage urgently. He said though the GHMC has started implementing its plan to make the city bin-free, it failed to chalk out an alternative mode. The GHMC had distributed Swachh auto trolleys for door-to-door collection of garbage, but several of them are not doing this and are using the vehicle for other purposes. Some of them are not in a position to repair vehicles that have developed snags. There are narrow roads and streets where the vehicles cannot enter. Residents and commercial establishments bundle their waste and dump them near street corners. Waste collection vehicles pick them up only the next day. In many cases, they do not collect garbage for days, resulting in traffic snarls during peak hours. People cannot walk or drive on the road because of the foul smell from the garbage heaps.   MLA Hussain is receiving several complaints from marketplaces and colonies. He fears this will create another pandemic situation.

   "text":"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders on Saturday said that Trinamool Congress' (TMC) election strategist Prashant Kishor`s leaked audiotape stating Prime Minister Narendra Modi is very popular in West Bengal has put the final nail in TMC's coffin. Speaking to ANI, BJP MP from Cooch Behar Nisith Pramanik said, \"Narendra Modi Ji is famous throughout the world. Prashant Kishor has done the work of putting the last nail in the coffin after finishing TMC.\"  Pramanik is contesting from the Dinhata constituency in the West Bengal Assembly election. Another BJP MP and party`s candidate from Chunchura Assembly seat Locket Chatterjee said, \"Prashant Kishor also knows that Modi Ji is the best and a `sonar Bangla` will be made under his leadership. But to fool the people he got associated with TMC.\" Meanwhile, BJP leader Rajib Banerjee who is contesting from the Domjur constituency in Howrah said Kishor`s strategy failed TMC in West Bengal.  \"Prashant Kishor`s strategy will not work in Bengal. His strategy has failed. TMC has finished here. In Bengal, only Narendra Modi`s strategy will work,\" Rajib told ANI.  An audio chat of `Club House room` involving Prashant Kishor and a few journalists went viral on social media. \"There is no anti-incumbency against Modi.  Modi has become a cult in the country. Modi is popular in Bengal. The Hindi speaking people is the core support base of BJP in Bengal. Modi is very popular here. Modi and Mamata are equally popular in Bengal,\" Kishore said in that conversation.  \"When we made a survey and asked people whose government will be formed in Bengal. The outcomes predominantly come in favour of the BJP. The majority says BJP`s government will be formed. There are sufficient workers of BJP on the ground. If we leave one or two districts, everywhere there are strong cadets of BJP,\" added Kishor. \"Suvendu is not a factor. Hindus, schedule caste, Dalit and Hindi speaking population are the key factors. Around 50-55 per cent of Hindus are voting for BJP. There are around one crore Hindi speaking population in West Bengal.  Matuas will predominantly vote for the BJP. When we made a survey and asked people whose government will be formed in Bengal. The outcomes predominantly comes in favour of BJP. In-ground there are workers of BJP,\" explained Kishor.  He further said the parties like Congress, Left and TMC have been practising appeasement politics in West Bengal.  \"For the last 20 years, there has been a blatant effort to appease the minority. The entire political ecosystem in Bengal be it Left, Congress or Didi have been to grab the Muslim votes. There is some element that BJP is exploiting. And that element is coming from the blatant misuse of minority politics,\" Kishor stated.  The election strategist was roped in by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) for the West Bengal Assembly Elections 2021.  Meanwhile, voting for 44 constituencies in West Bengal`s fourth phase Assembly elections began at 7 am on Saturday amid tight security. This phase of the elections will witness an intense battle between 373 candidates in 44 constituencies of the state across five districts -- Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly.  Among the 44 constituencies, nine are in Howrah, 10 in Hooghly, 11 in South 24 Parganas, five in Alipurduar and nine in Cooch Behar. A total of 1,15,81,022 voters will participate in this phase, out of which 2,63,016 are first-time voters. The fifth phase of the Assembly elections will commence on April 17.

   "text":"Authorities in Bangladesh on Friday moved more than 1,750 Rohingya Muslims to a controversial island in the Bay of Bengal despite complaints made by refugees already there. A Navy ship packed with migrants on its top deck set off from the port city of Chittagong on Friday. Officials said over 3,000 Rohingya would be taken by boat to Bhashan Char island on Friday and Saturday from congested camps on Bangladesh's border with Myanmar. With the new arrivals, some 7,000 Rohingya would be on the 13,000-acre (53-square kilometre) island. The government has, however, said about 100,000 people could be settled on Bhashan Char from the camps. Bangladesh has struggled to cope with more than 700,000 Rohingyas who fled across the frontier in 2017 after a Myanmar military crackdown on the Muslim minority. That added to 300,000 already in the camps. Rights groups say many of the Rohingya have been moved against their will and have also raised concerns over the safety of the island that is regularly flooded during the cyclone season.     Authorities want to move many of the new inhabitants before the cyclone season starts in April. Bhashan Char -- a silty strip that did not exist two decades ago -- is situated in a region where about 700,000 people have died in storms in the past 50 years. The United Nations says the relocation should be voluntary and it has not been involved in the operation.",

The company currently sells its products in India through third-party vendors and e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc-owned Flipkart. India, with more than 1 billion wireless subscribers of which about a third rely on basic handsets, provides huge growth prospects for smartphone makers, as well as cheap labor to manufacture the devices. Apple Inc  assembles some smartphones, including the iPhone 11, at Foxconn and Wistron’s plants in two southern Indian states. Through its online retail platform, Apple plans to offer assistance to customers in English and Hindi, while allowing users to engrave their iPads, Apple Pencil and Airpods in English and also in a handful of Indian languages, including Bengali and Gujarati. Earlier this week, Apple rolled out a virtual fitness service and a bundle of all its subscriptions, Apple One, focusing on services that are the backbone of Apple’s growth strategy and that cater to customers working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

   "text":"Myanmar’s Air Force appears to be using Chinese-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to monitor and perhaps to frighten protesters opposing the military junta, the British military intelligence publisher Janes International Defence Review said in a report Wednesday, citing images on social media showing low-flying drones over Mandalay last month. The images showed a CH-3A (Cai Hong-3A, or Rainbow-3A) tactical UAV flying in late March over Mandalay, where there have been mass street protests and bloody crackdowns in the wake of a military coup that deposed the elected government on Feb. 1. So far about 600 people have died in the crackdown. \"The sighting of the air vehicle, which is developed by Chinese state-owned defence prime China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), is especially noteworthy given the secrecy in how the Tatmadaw has operated it,\" said the report by the British open-source defense intelligence publisher. Janes said experts believe that between 10 and 12 CH-3A UAVs were delivered to Myanmar between roughly 2013 and 2015 and are operated by the Myanmar Air Force out of a base at Meiktila Air Base in the north-central part of the France-sized country of 54 million. These were \"understood to be used primarily as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets to support longstanding counterinsurgency (COIN) operations against ethnic rebel groups across the country,\" Jane’s said, adding that there have been reports that drones had been used to strike rebel infrastructure. Before last month, the only confirmed sighting of the CH-3A in Myanmar was provided by uncredited image widely circulated on the internet beginning in mid-2016 that showed the UAV being readied for take-off on a paved runway at an undisclosed location that looked like a small provincial airfield, the report said. Janes used commercially available satellite imagery to identify at least two operational UAVs outside a large hangar on Shante Air Base in Meiktila city, a flight distance of about 120 km (72 miles) from Mandalay, the country’s second largest city and the scene of mass demonstrations and numerous deaths of protesters. \"It is also worth noting that the air vehicles were seen when the satellite passed overhead on 31 January, a day before the Tatmadaw launched its coup,\" Janes said, using the Burmese name for the Myanmar military. The CH-3A is run by a truck-based mobile ground control station and a truck-based support module, has a maximum take-off weight of 650 kg (1,430 lbs.), and flies at a maximum speed of 260 kph (160 mph). It can be fitted to launch laser-guided air-to-ground missiles, Jane’s said. Janes said it is \"likely that the UAVs seen operating over Mandalay were used to observe ground activity, enabling the Tatmadaw to visually monitor the situation in real-time to identify specific threats and direct security forces as required.\" Other purposes include detecting and intercepting public or private communications – or as a psychological warfare tactic to intimidate the population, the report said, citing a study of the destabilizing impact on populations affected by the U.S. military’s use of UAVs in regions of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan “For the Tatmadaw, such deleterious psychological effects could eventually provide a critical advantage as it attempts to pacify a population that is clearly growing increasingly resistant by the day to its self-declared rule,” said the Janes report.",

The group involved in the election could be Dragonfly and Energetic Bear for its hackings of the energy sector. they breached the power grid, water treatment facilities and even nuclear power plants including Kansas.

September intrusions marked the first researchers caught the group, a unit of FSB targeting states and counties. the timing of the attacks so close to the election and the potential for disruption set off concern inside private security firms. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In 2016, Russian hackers from other groups were unusually noisy in their efforts to penetrate some state election databases. But Russia was called out and punished for its interference. The group has thus far stopped short of sabotage, but appears to be preparing for some future attack. The hackings so unnerved officials that starting in 2018, the U.S, Cyber Command, the arm of the Pentagon that conducted offensive cyberattacks, hit back with retaliatory strikes on the Russian grid.",

   "text":"Prince Philip, the husband of Britan’s Queen Elizabeth II   at the age of 99 on April 9 (Saturday). The last rites of Duke of Edinburgh will take place at St. George;s Chapel at Windsor Caste. As per a Page Six report, the funeral will be an intimate affair, limited to 30 participants under strict UK social-distancing rules. Even Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not attend the mourning ceremony, so as to allow space for as many royal family members as possible. The service will also see the presence of Prince Philip’s grandson Prince Harry who will reunite with his family to pay his last respects to his grandfather. However, his wife,   will be giving the funeral a miss. Meghan will not be attending Prince Philip’s last rites as pregnant with the couple’s second child. Page Six confirmed that the Duchess of Sussex who is is due to give birth to the couple’s second child, a girl, in early summer will stay home in California on her doctor’s advice, Buckingham Palace announced. Infact, a source close to the royals said that Markle hoped to be at his husband’s side, but the trip and the 12-hour flight were deemed potentially too taxing. \"The Duke of Sussex is planning to attend. The Duchess of Sussex has been advised by her physician not to travel. So the duke will be attending,\" a royal spokesman said at a press briefing, using Harry’s other title. Buckingham Palace announced on Friday (April 9) that Philip, the longtime husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died \"peacefully\" at Windsor Castle at the age of 99, just two months short of his 100th birthday. Philip became the queen’s consort, or official companion, after her father, King George VI, suddenly passed in 1952. He was the longest-serving British consort over his 73-year marriage to the queen.  Gun salutes were fired earlier on Saturday across the UK, in Gibraltar and at sea in memory of the duke, who was a senior figure in the navy before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.  (With ANI inputs)",

   "text":"Bangladesh has begun administering coronavirus vaccines to sex workers from the country's largest brothel, a vast warren of shacks home to around 1,900 prostitutes. The South Asian nation has so far vaccinated nearly three million people aged 40 or above with the AstraZeneca jab, but has scrapped the age restriction for sex workers at the town of Daulatdia in the country's west. \"At least 100 sex workers have already got the anti-Covid-19 jabs,\" Asif Mahmud, health chief in Daulatdia, told AFP. \"It is very necessary to vaccinate the sex workers... Thousands of people visit the brothel every day and the sex workers at the massive brothel are most vulnerable to the virus.\" The country has focused on inoculating the elderly, frontline health workers and security forces since its vaccination drive launched early this month, but plans to eventually cover about 80 percent of the population. The first sex workers from the brothel to receive the jab travelled to a clinic five kilometres (three miles) away, but Mahmud said authorities were also planning a dedicated vaccine centre inside the brothel. Mohammad Ibrahim, chief doctor in Daulatdia, said \"multiple awareness campaigns\" were being conducted to encourage more people to get the jab. Beauty, 40, who goes by one name, said she was initially hesitant as she had heard rumours that people died after receiving the shot. \"But the health officials reassured us. Now we understand it is important as we meet many people every day,\" she said. Bangladesh is one of the few Muslim nations where prostitution is legal for women aged over 18, and at least 11 brothels are operational across the country of 168 million. Beauty said vaccination would improve their incomes as many clients were worried about coronavirus and had been avoiding the congested brothel, which sits near a busy train station. In March authorities restricted visits to all brothels when they imposed a month-long nationwide lockdown. This badly hit the livelihoods of many sex workers and their families, forcing some to rely on food and cash handouts. Many left the brothel to work on the streets, community leaders said. Jhumur Begum, who heads the main association of sex workers at Daulatdia, said vaccination would help them get back on their feet. \"It will drive out the overwhelming fear that you will get the virus if you visit Daulatdia. There were also fears that any outbreak would be very deadly here,\" Begum said. Bangladesh is buying about 30 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses from the Serum Institute of India and will receive another 68 million from the Covax initiative, a global effort to encourage equitable distribution for poor nations. More than 8,300 people have died of the virus in the country while nearly 545,000 had been infected as of Wednesday.",

   "text":" Central teams have reported non-adherence of   appropriate behaviour in almost all of the 50 most-affected districts in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab, the Union health ministry said, advising the states to more strictly enforce norms to prevent the spread of the   . On the basis of feedback from the teams, the ministry has written to the states highlighting the areas of concern, including sub-optimal containment operations and contact tracing, skewed testing and shortage of health workers. Authorities need to work in these areas, it said. Of the 50 districts most affected by   , 30 are in Maharashtra, 11 in Chhattisgarh and nine in Punjab, it said. In a letter to the states, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the Centre has also taken note of issues related to vaccine availability and required action to augment supplies will be taken based on available stock. He said a brief summary of key performance indicators related to testing, hospital infrastructure and vaccination, as reported by the teams, has been shared for suitable corrective actions by state or district administrations. Thirty central teams have been deployed for the most affected districts in Maharashtra, Bhushan said. The ministry has written to the state highlighting that containment operations were found to be sub-optimal in Satara, Sangli and Aurangabad districts, with less than satisfactory perimeter control and lack of active surveillance for influenza-like illness cases. Surveillance and contact tracing were sub-optimal in Buldhana, Satara, Aurangabad and Nanded, mostly due to limited manpower, Bhushan said in a letter to the Maharashtra health secretary on Saturday. In Bhandara district, most cases are being reported from outside containment zones. This requires increasing the area of such zones or notifying new ones, the letter said. Testing capacity in Satara, Bhandara, Palghar, Amravati, Jalna and Latur is already overwhelmed, resulting in a delay in test results, it said. Teams from Nanded and Buldana have reported very skewed RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing ratio. Community resistance to COVID testing has been reported from Bhandara, the letter said. It said a large percentage of   patients are under home isolation in Bhandara and Satara. This requires rigorous follow up to minimise mortality and it is not happening, the letter said. \"lt was observed that delayed reporting by patients to definitive treatment centres in Satara is leading to a large number of deaths within first 72 hours of hospital admission,\" it said. Occupancy rates of available hospital bed capacity are very high in Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Nandurbar while medical oxygen supply was found to be an issue in Bhandara, Palghar, Osmanabad and Pune. Malfunctioning of ventilators was reported from Satara and Latur, and acute shortage of health workers from some other districts, the ministry said. It suggested expediting rostering of health workers and hiring of contractual health workers. \"Adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour was found to be lacking by almost all central teams that visited the districts. This would require greater enforcement effort,\" the ministry said. For Chhattisgarh, the team from Raipur and Jashpur districts reported a lack of perimeter control in containment zones. \"There appears to be no restriction on movement of people inside containment zones. Hence, containment zones, including micro-containment zones, need to be strictly implemented,\" a letter addressed to the state's additional chief secretary (health) said. Contact tracing needs to be reinforced in Korba. Resistance, even attacks on health workers, to containment activities and testing was reported from Dhaneli in Raipur. This needs to be addressed, it said. Lack or shortage of RT-PCR testing facilities was reported from some districts. The ministry suggested the state to deploy mobile labs for RT-PCR testing. Ambulance services also need to be strengthened in Durg and teams have noted that hospital bed occupancy rates are high in Balod, Raipur, Durg and Mahasamund, it said. District administrations need to ramp up hospital infrastructure and another logistic requirement to meet the demand arising from the surge in   cases. Shortage of Remdesivir and low molecular weight Heparin needs urgent attention in Korba, the ministry said. Limited oxygen availability and oxygen wastage were reported from Raipur and shortage of health workers from few districts. \"There appears to be a need for refresher training of surveillance teams and vaccinators in Balod and Korba districts respectively,\" it said. Overcrowding and no physical distancing was observed at a vaccination centre in Rajnandangaon, the ministry said. In Punjab, there is a need to enhance focus on contact tracing in Patiala and Ludhiana. Contact tracing and surveillance in SAS Nagar are being hampered due to a shortage of manpower and an additional workforce must be deployed, Bhushan said in his letter to the Punjab health secretary. Low rates of testing were reported from Patiala and there is no RT-PCR testing lab in Rupnagar. These need to be addressed, the letter said. There is no dedicated COVID hospital in SAS Nagar and Rupnagar, and patients are being referred to neighbouring districts or Chandigarh, it said. Hospital bed occupancy rates in some districts are high and arrangements must be made by authorities to deal with surge in cases, the letter said. Teams have reported issues with the procurement of ventilators in SBS Nagar. ln Rupnagar, though ventilators are available, they are not being optimally used due to a shortage of workforce, particularly doctors and nurses. Contractual hiring of health workers can address the problem, the letter said. Shortage in the workforce has been reported from Patiala, SAS Nagar and Rupnagar also. Patiala and Ludhiana have reported a slow pace of COVID vaccination among people above 45 years with co-morbidities and those above 60 years, it said.",

   "text":"SINGAPORE: In 2019, there were more than 6.5 million visits to Singapore’s public swimming pools. In today’s post-COVID-19 world, the visitor figures are about 60 per cent of monthly capacity. Some things have not changed, however; for instance, a number of people think it is acceptable not to shower before entering the pool, the programme   finds out in a series of vox pops. Others may even pee in the pool, thinking that chlorine is used to disinfect the water. The problem, however, is that urine and sweat contain ammonia, which reduces the effect that chlorine has on the water. So what is being done to keep the pools sufficiently clean to protect swimmers from bacteria and viruses, which can enter the water? And what is the principal reason why one should shower before swimming? Marchwood Laboratory Services technical manager Tan Thuan Piang, who has sampled Singapore’s pool waters with his team for over 15 years, noted that ammonia in pools, though mainly from sweat and urine, also comes from sunscreen lotion and cosmetics. While the amount of ammonia in Singapore’s pools is usually “minute” — low enough to escape detection — a possible reason for this is that ammonia “reacts very fast” with chlorine in the water to form the by-product chloramine, he said. When there is a “heavy chlorine smell”, it is usually tri-chloramine, a type of chloramine formed as the ammonia level rises and “not the chlorine we really want”, cited Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder. “It’s a nuisance,” said the professor, who has studied water quality and safety for more than 20 years. “As the chlorine forms chloramine, there’s less chlorine there. So we have to … add more chlorine to keep the level safe. “If we don’t practise good hygiene, the amount of chlorine in a swimming pool will drop quickly and make it less safe … The more hygiene we have, the less ammonia there’ll be and the cleaner the pools stay.” This is why he “always” advocates showering before entering the pool — to minimise the amount of chemicals it needs. Chloramine can also have a more direct effect on swimmers. National Skin Centre consultant dermatologist Lucinda Tan, who handles two to three patients a month for swimming-related conditions, said chloramines can “irritate and dry the skin” by stripping away the skin’s natural protective oil. “This allows dust, bacteria (and) allergens to enter and cause irritation. A normal person with normal skin … may get away with that,” she said. “You break a lot of the skin barrier, and you allow a lot of germs to enter, and then you can get bad infections,\" she added. “If your immune system is compromised … and (you have) a small cut and whatnot, you can still pick up an infection that can potentially worsen with time.” She noted that all exposed parts of the body, including the hair and eyes, can be affected. People may also end up with a dry and itchy throat if they swallow “a little bit more” pool water. And some children may be more susceptible to dry, irritating skin than adults. To maintain safety, there are national standards for the chlorine level in Singapore’s swimming pools: It must be between one to three parts per million. “Too little chlorine (and) it’d encourage algae to form. Too much chlorine (and) you’d feel the itch and discomfort on (your) skin,” said Jonas Su, operations director of pool maintenance company Anwill. Normally, at the end of a servicing, his team adds chlorine even if the pool passes muster, as the reading would drop. “By adding a little bit more, probably it’ll shoot up … still within the ideal range,” he said. “It’ll last for a few days before we come again.” Other parameters for testing pool cleanliness include the pH value, colour and turbidity (cloudiness) of the water. By regulation, the pH value — which shows the level of acidity or alkalinity — should be between 7.2 and 7.8. But when Talking Point submitted samples from 10 public pools — in Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bishan, Clementi, Jalan Besar, Jurong East, Kallang Basin, Queenstown, Tampines and Yishun — to Marchwood for testing, half of them were not within this range. “It’s not a concern,” said Marchwood’s Tan, who described the readings of 8.1 to 8.3 as “slightly higher”. “But any pH that’s above nine will cause some skin irritation.” Marchwood also tested the samples for faecal bacteria, namely E. coli and the coliform count. By the National Environment Agency’s standards, there should not be more than 200 bacteria per millilitre of water. And all the samples met this standard as well as the other test parameters. Besides adding chlorine to pools, the cleaning process includes scooping up debris and vacuuming the bottom of the pools. This can be a laborious task. What swimmers can do for personal hygiene on their part is relatively simple, however, like having a quick rinse before entering the pool to get rid of dirt, as well as applying moisturiser and sunblock if needed. Although moisturisers would contribute to the formation of chloramine, Tan the dermatologist said their use would help buffer the effects of chlorine or chloramine on skin. There are “two broad groups” of moisturisers: One has the “building blocks” of skin to repair the skin; the other acts as a protective barrier. “So it depends on a patient’s preference and the skin conditions,” she said. “Generally, you’d want something slightly oilier because you want the moisturiser to last for the duration of the swim … The ones that are more water-resistant would help as well.\" She also recommended having a rinse immediately after leaving the pool to “get rid of all the chlorine”. She added: “If possible, use a gentle cleanser (for) a more complete removal.” For extra assurance, swimmers can even get a test strip online that shows the pH and chlorine levels of the water on the spot.",
