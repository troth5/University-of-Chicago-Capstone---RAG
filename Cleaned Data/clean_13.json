Pich Theareth, a 31-year-old also known as Sna, died while in police custody on April 3 following his arrest for allegedly murdering his wife Chea Chanrachna by electrocution out of jealousy that same day. Sna’s sister, Pich Lina, said his wife had died in an accident, but Sna’s mother-in-law accused him of cutting a power line to kill her and demanded that the police arrest him. He was later found dead of what authorities said was a heart attack, but Pich Lina said that head-to-toe bruising on his face, legs, and arms suggested that he had been tortured to death in custody. Photos of Sna’s bloody and bruised body quickly circulated on social media and on April 4, amid public criticism of the authorities over his death, Battambang Provincial Police Commissioner Kosal issued a statement. In it, he claimed that Sna had been taken for questioning the day before by the Sangke District Police Inspectorate, during which he admitted to murdering his wife and that he was a “regular drug user” who had taken the methamphetamine known as “ice” twice in just over an hour on the day he killed her. Kosal said that after questioning him, police locked Sna in the local detention center, where he shouted repeatedly in his cell before making “abnormal noises” and finally going silent. When police inspected his cell, they found him unconscious and rushed him to the hospital, the commissioner said, but he died on the way. The commissioner claimed that the autopsy showed that Sna had died of a heart attack due to drug overdose and stressed that “police did not beat or torture him.” He did not comment on what had caused the injuries and bruises found on Sna’s body but said that his family is free to file a complaint with the courts seeking justice if they were not satisfied by the police report. Pich Lina told RFA’s Khmer Service Monday that during Sna’s arrest, police “handcuffed him and beat him at the scene” and then took him away, later informing her of his death. She said she had never heard of her brother taking drugs before and said he was in good health, questioning the police claims and calling for a reinvestigation. “He was beaten—his ears were bleeding, head was swollen, his arms, legs, and thighs all had bad bruise marks … and both of his ankles showed electric scars,” she said, adding that she believes he was “tortured like an animal.” “I do not know for sure whether the police allowed the relatives of my brother’s wife to beat him up or the police themselves tortured him. Where is the law? … If my brother is a murderer, put him in prison for 20 to 30 years, or for life. You have no right to take away my brother’s life. A murderer must be convicted.” The Battambang provincial coordinating officer for local rights group Adhoc, Yin Mengly, confirmed to RFA that photos of Sna’s body showed “multiple wounds and bruises,” leading him to suspect torture. He added that any case of torture involves a serious crime because authorities have no right to use such methods, even if the suspect is guilty. But he expressed concern that justice would be unlikely to prevail for the victim and his family because Sna’s body has already been cremated and the case involves police officers. “Torture and scarring are common among suspects and [the police] do this for the purpose of obtaining answers,” he said. “Our criminal law also deals with torture and crime [as] Cambodia is a signatory to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment … We ask to have independent groups seriously examine his body because heart attacks don’t produce bruises or scars.” Cases of police officers beating or torturing suspects during arrest or interrogation, causing serious injuries or death, are common in Cambodia. The families of the victims rarely receive justice without intervention by Prime Minister Hun Sen. Article 210 of the Penal Code stipulates that torture or other cruel acts committed against a person shall be punishable by imprisonment for seven to 15 years. In addition, if the crime was committed by a public official within the framework of his function or on the job, the official must be sentenced to between 10 and 20 years in prison. Also on Monday, Adhoc’s Yin Mengly called on authorities to launch an in-depth investigation into the death of 47-year-old migrant worker Ny Mab, who Battambang provincial police said died by suicide in the bathroom of the Bavel-Samaki Secondary School building in Bovel district on April 4 while in quarantine after recently returning home from Thailand to ensure that he had not been infected with the coronavirus. In a letter to Battambang provincial governor Nguon Rattanak, Bavel district governor Nou Bunyang claimed that Ny Mab suffered from a “severe mental health disorder” that caused him to kill himself and that there is no need for further investigation into his death. “They have already done an autopsy with the health department concluding that he hanged himself in the bathroom,” provincial police chief Sat Kimsan told RFA on Monday. “You can get detailed information from the commissioner [website] about his case,” he said, adding that the commissioner’s office “has additional documents” confirming Ny Mab’s cause of death. But Yin Mengly told RFA that Ny Mab’s death “cannot end with a simple report from the Bavel district governor,” noting that authorities had failed to provide detailed evidence or witnesses that could confirm any history that might have led him to kill himself. Instead, he said, an independent commission should be established to determine the cause of death. “We can’t determine this because the person in question has already died,” he said. “This is why we are asking authorities to explain the case in detail so that there is no doubt about his cause of death. The death of a person is not like the death of a pig or a cow—human life is … more valuable than that of animals. So, the situation needs to be made clear.” RFA was unable to reach Ny Mab’s relatives for comment Monday. Ny Mab’s death is not the first time a Cambodian worker has died during quarantine for the coronavirus. In early January, a 52-year-old worker died during a 14-day quarantine in Tbong Khmum province. At the time, Information Minister Khieu Kanharith wrote on his Facebook page that the victim had a heart attack after falling and hitting his head on a toilet bowl, but authorities released little information about the circumstances surrounding the death. As of Monday, Cambodia has recorded 2,752 cases of COVID-19—the disease caused by the coronavirus—since its latest outbreak began in February. While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, 21 people have died from COVID-19 since the country recorded its first deathon the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the virus a global pandemic last month.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162803", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13216", "source": "scrapy"},

Cambodia, which had largely remained unscathed by the coronavirus, registered its first death from COVID-19—the disease caused by the virus—last month, a year to the day that that the World Health Organization labeled it a pandemic. Since then, 22 people have died, and more than 2,800 people have tested positive. In a statement, the NGOs noted that borrowers are unable to avoid potential exposure to the coronavirus because they fear losing their land or homes if they cannot repay their debt. They said that the garment, tourism, entertainment and construction sectors have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic—sectors that employ hundreds of thousands of women, who hold 75 percent of microfinance loans in Cambodia. However, farmers, migrant workers, poor communities, informal workers, traders, small businesspeople and street vendors “have also seen incomes plummet,” according to the statement, meaning that “very few people have been spared” amid the economic downturn. “The government has already taken measures to ease some of the suffering caused by more than a year of economic turmoil,” the NGOs said, including cash transfers to the poor and subsidies to garment workers. “But the government did not take similarly swift action to offer relief to microfinance borrowers. The government’s request last year for MFIs and banks to implement relief for only certain sectors, without clear guidelines for which borrower qualifies or what type of relief to offer, effectively allowed the financial sector to set its own rules for restructuring loans.” The NGOs said that as a result, banks and MFIs are suspending principal payments, but continue to collect and calculate interest on the loans. “This has resulted in record profits for some microloan providers as household incomes continue to fall as a result of the … pandemic, and larger debt burdens for borrowers after their restructuring ends. This is not real relief.” Amid the latest outbreak, the NGOs called for “widely implemented relief,” saying that incomplete restructuring for around 10 percent of microloans “is nowhere near enough to deal with the scale of this crisis.” “We are asking the government to help millions of people by ordering the profitable financial sector to help carry some of the economic burden,” they said. “Borrowers are losing their land, foregoing medical care, and risking their health and safety during the pandemic to repay these debts. A three-month suspension, with the possibility of further extension, will help borrowers’ stay home, stay safe, and improve the overall situation in the country.” Ny Sokha, with the local rights group Adhoc, told RFA’s Khmer Service that the government should come up with a policy to assist those in need during the pandemic. “This request is being made during this particularly challenging situation due to curfews and quarantines,” he said. “It is seriously affecting the living standards of the people.” Government spokesman Phay Siphan told RFA that the NGOs’ requests are impossible to honor because “Cambodia is a free economic market.” He said debtors and creditors need to determine a path forward between themselves. “The people can’t rely on the government because when they didn’t consult with us when they took the loans,” he said. “They need to be responsible for their own fates.” Cambodia Microfinance Association (CMA) spokesman Kaing Tongngy told RFA that CMA members are also affected by the pandemic, which has left them facing high operational costs and a steep decline in revenue. “We consider our clients long-time customers, so when they have financial problems, we will gather our resources to help them as much as we can, even if that means we lose revenue,” he said. “However, we cannot help them on a largescale because we are having problems on our end.” The call from NGOs came as Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen issued an order “prohibit[ing] villagers from temporarily traveling from one province to another for the 14 days between April 7 and April 20 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus,” as well as the closure of all tourist destinations. The lockdown does provide for certain exceptions for essential travel. Hun Sen also ordered the Ministry of Health to prepare COVID-19 patients with “mild symptoms” to receive treatment at home, due to a rise in local transmissions. He said Cambodia will adapt U.S. and European measures in treating COVID-19 patients when hospitals cannot accommodate them due to a lack of beds. “We cannot accommodate all patients when fewer patients recover then those who are getting sick,” he said. “In this situation, we won’t have enough [room in] hospitals, so the solution is to keep people with mild symptoms treated at home.” But even as the government introduced new measures to stem the spread of the virus, it faced criticism Tuesday from New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) for its prior policies that the group said constituted an assault on people’s right to privacy and other human rights. In a statement, HRW said that the government’s “Stop COVID-19” QR Code system, implemented on Feb. 20 by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and Ministry of Health to assist with contact tracing of new COVID-19 cases is too intrusive and urged the ministries to explain how collected data is used, who has access to it and for what purpose, how the data is secured, and how long it is stored. “Cambodia’s QR Code system is ripe for rights abuses because it lacks privacy protections for personal data,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at HRW. “These concerns are heightened by the government’s stepped-up online surveillance of Cambodians since the outset of the pandemic, putting government critics and activists at greater risk.” The Post and Telecommunications Ministry and other relevant ministries did not respond to queries about how the system works when contacted by HRW in mid-March, the group said. According to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry’s Facebook page, the system is “voluntary,” but “participation is strongly encouraged.” When users scan a QR code as they enter an establishment, they receive a six-digit code to their cellphone via text message, which they need to enter into their phone. Some 155,000 institutions have registered to use the system and several provincial authorities are using it at provincial border crossing-points as part of mandatory screening for COVID-19 symptoms. Health Minister Mam Bunheng has said that the QR Code system is used to record the movements of people at registered locations without violating thier privacy, but the Post and Telecommunications Ministry later said that the system would provide the government with information about the user’s location, allowing the authorities identify the user and whether they were violating two-week quarantine requirements. “Creating a log of people’s locations reveals sensitive insights about their identity, location, behavior, associations, and activities that infringe on the right to privacy, adding to the government’s existing intrusive surveillance practices,” HRW said. “Cambodia should enact a data protection law that would regulate and protect the usage, collection, and retention of data in accordance with international standards for privacy and other rights.”", "image_url": "<img alt=\"cambodia-hun-sen-hospital-vaccine-march-2021.JPG\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/cambodia-hun-sen-hospital-vaccine-march-2021.jpg/@@images/85615131-6743-476a-ae90-5715d1e3a243.jpeg\" title=\"cambodia-hun-sen-hospital-vaccine-march-2021.JPG\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162805", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13631", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.wionews.com", "section": "WORLD", "sub_section": "Central Asia", "article_url": "https://www.wionews.com/south-east-asia/confusion-concern-as-locked-down-philippines-starts-coronavirus-quarantine-286964", "title": "Confusion, concern as locked-down Philippines starts coronavirus quarantine", "author": "Reuters", "author_link": "", "published_date": "    Manila\n    ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "The measures widen a lockdown since Friday that brought immigration limits, curfews, closures of schools and malls, bans on gatherings, social distancing, and restrictions on movement for the capital", "text": "Millions of people woke up confused, confined and frustrated in the Philippines on Tuesday, as a sweeping home quarantine order kicked in with just a few hours of warning, and Southeast Asia prepared tighter measures against a surge in coronavirus cases. With many unaware that half the population of 107 million had been told to stay home for a month, stranded workers crowded checkpoints on the edges of Manila as vehicles tried to duck suspensions and police impounded taxis that were still running. \"I need to make a living for my family,\" said Albert Santos, 42, the driver of a passenger jeep, adding that he would try to make as much money before being forced to stop. \"I can't stop or they have nothing to eat.\" The Philippines is the first regional nation to take such drastic steps against the virus, which President Rodrigo Duterte described as \"the fight of our lives\", after deeming existing curbs on movement and gatherings insufficient. In just 10 days, virus infections in the Philippines climbed to 142 from three, with 12 deaths. Malaysia will follow suit from Wednesday, closing borders, schools and most businesses, while restricting internal movement, after a daily jump of 125 cases to 553, nearly two-thirds of them linked to a major event at a mosque. Cambodia's infections doubled to 24 on Tuesday and Thailand reported 30 new ones, taking its tally to 177, for a nearly threefold jump in a week. The regional trend casts more doubt on the view that warmer weather might stem the spread. Thailand's cabinet agreed on Tuesday to close schools, cinemas, bars and entertainment centres, and postpone next month's festivities for New Year in the mainly Buddhist nation. Manila's usually busy business areas were almost deserted on the first morning of home quarantine, with only delivery trucks, police patrols and occasional private vehicles on the roads. City workers in protective suits disinfected public areas, security guards sat outside banks and convenience stores and workers trickled home after night shifts at call centres and medical clinics, among the few exemptions to Duterte's curbs. Many shift workers were stranded after transport was suspended. Police pulled over dozens of taxis, with drivers - and many commuters - unaware of the new quarantine measures, announced on Monday afternoon and only clarified late at night. \"I need to work. I don't get paid if I don't show up,\" said Sheila Reyes, 24, as she waited hopefully for a ride to a factory, some of which are allowed to operate. \"If I have to, I'll walk to work.\" The measures widen a lockdown since Friday that brought immigration limits, curfews, closures of schools and malls, bans on gatherings, social distancing, and restrictions on movement for the capital. The Philippines suspended financial markets on Tuesday, the first trading shutdown in a world struggling to rein in the virus. Malaysia postponed a meeting this week of APEC finance officials. Philippine authorities said international airports in Manila and Clark would be closed to citizens, amid an expected exodus of foreigners before the expiry of a 72-hour deadline to leave. Teething troubles from the quarantine were inevitable and stranded people would receive help to get home and stay there, said Jonathan Malaya, an interior ministry official. \"As expected, there still are people uninformed on last night's announcement,\" he said. \"We have some kinks to fix ... it will normalise once people understand that they really need to stay home.\" In Bangkok's Patpong area, famed for racy nightlife and counterfeit handbags, bar owners and workers said they were already suffering from the virus effect, and mandatory closures were probably for the best. \"We have to follow the government's measures,\" said one bar worker, Kornpisit Kutakorn. \"We have to do this for the common interest.\"", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/17/133340-untitled-design61.jpg?itok=LrIVS2p8\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162803", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22788", "source": "scrapy"},

The department did not identify the woman. After the incident occurred last year, Dixon told police that he pepper sprayed the woman after she assaulted him, the department said. Neither Dixon nor the woman mentioned the gun to responding officers, and the department said there was no evidence at the time that suggested he displayed the weapon.

Ron DeSantis' roundtable discussion last month.", "text": "Video of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and a panel of scientists apparently trading in Covid-19 misinformation has been pulled from YouTube. The video of DeSantis’ roundtable discussion last month at the state Capitol in Tallahassee was removed on Wednesday because it violated the social media platform’s standards, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said. It had been embedded in a Tampa-area   and it's removal was flagged by the  , a \"free market\" think tank based in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. “YouTube has clear  to support the health and safety of our users,” Hernandez said in a statement. “We removed AIER’s video because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19.” Hernandez said YouTube only allows videos “that otherwise   to remain on the platform if they contain sufficient educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context.” “Our policies apply to everyone and focus on content regardless of the speaker or channel,” Hernandez said. DeSantis's press secretary Cody McCloud called YouTube's move \"another blatant example of Big Tech attempting to silence those who disagree with their woke corporate agenda.\" \"YouTube claimed they removed the video because 'it contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities,' yet this roundtable was led by world-renowned doctors and epidemiologists from Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard, all of whom are eminently qualified to speak on the global health crisis,\" McCloud said. \"Good public health policy should include a variety of scientific and technical expertise, and YouTube’s decision to remove this video suppresses productive dialogue of these complex issues.\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, one of the scientists on the panel, said this \"was a policy forum, in which it is appropriate to consider both the benefits and costs of a policy (child masking) when making judgments and recommendations.\" \"YouTube’s censorship of our discussion is contrary to American democratic norms of free expression,\" the professor said in an email. \"It is also a violation of basic standards of scientific conduct, which stand in opposition to unreasoned silencing of contrary views and require the free exchange of ideas.\" Earlier, AIER editorial director Jeffrey A. Tucker insisted  Wednesday on the think tank’s website that YouTube censored DeSantis and the scientists and called it “the latest attack on public health information.” Many public health experts, however, have accused Bhattacharya and the other scientists on the panel with DeSantis — former Trump White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Scott Atlas; epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta; and Dr. Martin Kulldorff — of spreading public health misinformation. NBC News has also reached out to Tucker, Atlas, Gupta and Kulldorff for comment. NBC News did not see the video before it was removed. Tucker first reported its removal. But based on a transcript provided by YouTube, it appears the participants ran afoul of the platform’s standards when DeSantis asked whether children in school should be wearing masks and Kulldorff replied, “Uh, children should not wear face masks, no. They don’t need it for their own protection, and they don’t need it for protecting other people either.” Less than a minute later, Bhattacharya chimed-in, saying that mask-wearing “is developmentally inappropriate and it just doesn’t help on the disease spread.” “There’s no scientific rationale or logic to have children wear masks in school,” Atlas said six minutes later. That language also appears in the   with his article. Those claims run counter to the recommendations of the federal  , which advises that “people age 2 and older should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household.” The  recommendations are a bit looser for younger children, but kids age 12 and over “should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults.” All the scientists in the video but Atlas are signatories to  , which was   and which opposed lockdowns and argued that society would build herd immunity against Covid-19 if all but people over age 70 “resume life as normal.” Atlas, who is  , was especially  to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Many of the world’s leading scientists denounced The Great Barrington Declaration as a “ unsupported by scientific evidence.” And later, then-President Donald Trump’s CDC chief, Dr. Robert Redfield, was overhead by NBC saying of Atlas, “Everything he says is false.” The Trump administration  , as did DeSantis, who was criticized by public health experts for being   and for reopening the state too soon. Most of the Covid-19 deaths and cases were recorded in Florida after DeSantis visited Trump in the White House last April and prematurely, as it turned out, declared  .

Hundreds of thousands of people in the Arab world are turning to Clubhouse, the fast-growing audio chat app, to mock and vent against longtime rulers, debate sensitive issues from abortion to sexual harassment, or argue where to find the best and cheapest shawarma sandwich during an economic crisis. The discussions are endless as they are breathless. More than 970,000 people from the Middle East have downloaded the new platform since it launched outside the U.S. in January. It has offered space for in-person conversations in an age where direct contact is at the mercy of the pandemic and it’s brought together those at home and the many in exile or abroad. But mostly, it has offered a release for bottled-up frustration in a region where violent conflicts and autocrats have taken hold and where few, if any, avenues for change — or even for speaking out — seem tenable. “It is an open coffeehouse that pierces through what is forbidden by the political regimes in the region,” said Diana Moukalled, a Lebanese journalist who closely follows social platforms. “Clubhouse has made people go back to debating one another.” The Middle East accounts for 6.1 percent of the 15.9 million global downloads of Clubhouse, which launched in the United States a year ago. Saudi Arabia ranks no. 7 globally for the invitation-only downloads, with over 660,000, just after Thailand and before Italy, according to San Francisco-based mobile app analytics firm Sensor Tower. One reason for its popularity seems to be the no-holds-barred atmosphere, fueled by the liveliness of group conversation. Saudis organized rooms to discuss who could replace their aging king instead of his ambitious son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They argued with Egyptians over what they considered democracy and with Lebanese and Jordanians over their kingdom’s perceived meddling in their affairs. Other rooms tackle taboo topics ranging from atheism to homosexuality. A Saudi woman discussed whether abortions should be allowed in the kingdom, prompting a heated back and forth. The platform also became a place to exchange information, challenging the region’s largely state-dominated media. Minutes after reports of an attempted coup in Jordan last week, Jordanians inside and outside the country congregated in a room to share information on the confusing reports released and controlled by the government. Families of those arrested in the ensuing sweep shared their news. Some users defended King Abdullah while backers of the brother prince accused of the coup vowed to rally behind him. Previously unimaginable debates took place among parts of society who would otherwise shun or block each other on other social media. Opponents debated supporters of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group. Elsewhere, Lebanese railed against private banks they blame for their country’s economic meltdown — with bankers in the room. In another room, Iraqis — mainly exiles — criticized how their country’s many religious militias impacted their lives. The moderator, a woman from the southern Shiite city of Najaf now living in Europe, told how her conservative family tried to mold her into “being like them” and opposed sending her to universities where men and women mingle. She fended off one man who suggested she was exaggerating, telling him he hadn’t experienced what she did. The moderator went on and named figures from powerful Shiite militias and religious leaders, saying she’d seen how they flout the rules they set for others. In the free-flowing conversation, militia supporters frequently interrupted, sparking a torrent of expletives from the moderator and others until they were forced to leave. “They controlled the ground with their muscles,” the moderator said of the militias. “But social media need brains. This (space) is ours.” Among the hundreds of rooms discussing the war in Syria, some users decided to lighten the mood. Opposition activists organized a spoof interview with someone posing as President Bashar Assad. It drew laughs but also poignant reminders of how the 10-year conflict devastated the country. “I ran away from you and still you follow me to Clubhouse,” one exiled Syrian told the fake “Assad.” But concerns are mounting that the open space could quickly come under the same government surveillance or censorship as other social media. A decade ago, activists in the Arab Spring protests flocked to Twitter and Facebook, which offered a similar free space. Since then, authorities have come to use the sites to target and arrest critics and spread their own propaganda. Oman has already blocked the Clubhouse app. In Jordan, it is obstructed on certain mobile networks, while in the United Arab Emirates, users have described unexplainable glitches. Pro-government commentators have railed against Clubhouse in TV shows and newspapers, accusing it of helping terrorists plan attacks, spreading pornography or undermining religious and state figures. First, Clubhouse drew rights defenders and political activists. Then came the government backers. “This room has grown because Salman’s people are here to defend him,” shouted a participant in a room featuring opponents of the Saudi crown prince. A discussion of the release of imprisoned Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul’s devolved into panicked mayhem when a few participants threatened to expose attendees and report them to authorities. The chat soon cut off. Recordings surfaced online from Clubhouse conversations deemed offensive, such as about homosexuality becoming acceptable, fueling fears that pro-government Saudi users were keeping tabs on critics. One participant asked to leave a chat among Lebanese when it was discovered she was Israeli, in part because some users feared they could be prosecuted under Lebanese laws banning mixing with Israelis. Some fear security agents are secretly in the rooms. Most participants in the app, which remains exclusive to iPhone users, use real names and sometimes put detailed bios. But growing numbers use fake names. Without anonymity, Clubhouse disagreements could turn into violence in real life, said Ali Sibai, a consultant with Beirut-based digital rights group Social Media Exchange, SMEX. Clubhouse’s “vague” policies also raise concerns, he said. The company says it temporarily stores conversations for investigating abuses. But it doesn’t say for how long or who reviews the Arabic content, raising questions whether unknown third parties may be involved, endangering participants’ security, he said. Moukalled, editor of Daraj, an independent online media, said it would be no surprise if authorities impose surveillance on Clubhouse. But, she said, something else would come along. “So long as people don’t feel they are part of the decision-making process, they will find these platforms.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/rockcms/2021-04/918/210409-clubhouse-app-al-1201-3a94fb_4f2406532eabed7266e7b8828c7f4aa9aba2a8ea.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Clubhouse App\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162806", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "43867", "source": "scrapy"},

The 57-year-old Black woman from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, feared that her high blood pressure and diabetes might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. Then a member of Pringle’s church, a local NAACP leader who has led a vaccination campaign targeting Black residents, urged her to reconsider. He shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. “That’s what made me change my mind,” said Pringle, who finally agreed to an appointment to get her first   shot Thursday. “I had to pray about it. And I felt better after that.” Campaigns aimed at Black communities across the US are making headway in the effort to persuade people that the   vaccines are safe and effective. With millions of dollars in assistance from President Joe Biden’s administration, local groups have urged Black Americans to roll up their sleeves for shots and set aside what for some is a shared historical distrust of science and government. A poll by   for Public Affairs Research in late March found that about 24 percent of Black American adults said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. That’s down from 41 percent in January. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots in almost the same proportion as white Americans at 26 percent and Hispanic Americans at 22 percent. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken “almost a 180-degree turnaround” as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. He credited Black physicians, faith leaders and other community organisers for being trusted messengers during the pandemic, which has killed more than 5,50,000 Americans. “It’s the messenger and the message,” but the messenger “is probably the most important part of it, and people doing it in a way that wasn’t preachy,” Benjamin said. “They didn’t tell people, ‘You need to get vaccinated because it’s your duty.’ They basically said, ‘Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family.’” Some of the most effective outreach has relied on existing community relationships, such as local physicians talking about their own decisions to get vaccinated, to reassure the public, said Dr Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. Community members in the Baltimore area who knew Cooper from her research on food deserts and nutrition trusted her as a source of information on   , she said. Based on that relationship, “people felt comfortable hearing from me,” she said. Some state health departments have rolled out ads targeting communities of color. NAACP chapters in some cities have booked appointments for people to get shots. Pastors of Black churches have urged their parishioners to take the vaccines. In Brunswick, Georgia, the Rev John Perry and another Black pastor put their faces on a billboard promoting the vaccines, and postcards with a similar image were mailed to residents. Both efforts were produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. “I think we still have enough people on the fence that are going to budge and get their shots,” said Perry, who initially wanted to wait a year before getting his shots but changed his mind after reading up on how the vaccines were developed. He got his second dose Wednesday. Jason Pettibone, a Black barber in Perry’s coastal Georgia community, remains hesitant. His parents and sister have all been vaccinated with no ill effects. Yet Pettibone said the stories he hears from customers — including one who swore his father lost all feeling in the right side of his body after getting a shot — have made it hard to overcome his uncertainty. “I’m thinking in my head not only would it be good for me to get it, because I don’t want to get sick myself, but also to protect other people who come into the shop,” Pettibone said. “But it’s the unknown. Everybody’s really scared of the unknown.” In Savannah, Georgia, community activist Natavia Sanders said outreach efforts can backfire with some in the Black community who suspect the government is targeting them as test subjects rather than seeking to protect their health. Some of that skepticism can be traced to an infamous study in Tuskegee, Alabama, where the government let hundreds of Black men suffer untreated syphilis for 40 years for research purposes. Sanders declined to say whether she was getting vaccinated. She said she’s spoken with several people who had to be hospitalised with   but still have doubts about the vaccines. “That’s how skeptical people are,” Sanders said. “They’re like, ‘No, I’ll fight it myself. I fought it already.’” PM Browner got her vaccine Wednesday in Clarksdale, Mississippi. The 88-year-old Black woman said she doesn’t understand why she needs to get vaccinated if she’s not sick or around sick people. Still, she agreed to get her shot. She said she thinks vaccinations will eventually be required, and she wants to be able to continue to socialise at a local senior center. “If you ain’t got nothing, why do we need to take it?” Browner said. “But we’ll take it because later on, they’ll say, ‘You’ve got to take it.’ If you don’t, later on, I think we’ll have to.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" alt=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pfizer-vaccine-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162559", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "44667", "source": "scrapy"},

Delta first started blocking middle seats and limiting capacity on smaller planes in April near the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other airlines had similar policies, including Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines, but they have since gone back to selling all seats. Physically distancing from other passengers is extremely difficult on an airplane. Delta and other carriers have repeatedly said filtration systems and intense cleaning make it unlikely that travelers will catch Covid-19 on a plane. But Delta said many travelers choose Delta over other airlines because it kept its policy in place. CEO Ed Bastian said in announcement that 65% of customers who flew Delta in 2019 said they expect to have at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by May 1 and that that is “giving us the assurance to offer customers the ability to choose any seat on our aircraft, while also introducing new services, products and rewards to support the journey.” The change comes just as what an improved summer travel season approaches. Generally the most lucrative time of year, airlines suffered as many potential customers stayed home last year. But with vaccines rolling out across the country, airline executives are upbeat about an increase in bookings for late spring and summer trips. Delta announced a host of other changes aimed to drum up revenue. Tickets valid until the end of this year as well as all tickets purchased this year would be valid until the end of 2022. Delta also said its customers can earn as much as 75% more to get to Medallion Status. The carrier and its rivals’ frequent flyer programs have become more important during the pandemic. These programs make money by selling miles to banks, which customers earn when they use rewards credit cards. Delta last year raised a then-record $9 billion in debt backed by its SkyMiles program. The carrier is also bringing back snacks on board on April 14 and in early June it will offer hot meals in its Delta One or first class cabins on some transcontinental flights.

Authorities have blamed the ferocious resurgence of the virus mainly on crowding and a reluctance to wear masks. Still, religious gatherings have continued and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have themselves addressed election campaigns attended by tens of thousands of people, many without masks and hardly any following social distancing. New COVID-19 cases surged to 152,879 on Sunday, the sixth record rise in seven days, overwhelming hospitals in some regions.  India, known as the pharmacy of the world, has already stalled major exports of coronavirus vaccines. In addition to the Remdesivir ban \"till the situation improves\", the health ministry said in a statement that manufacturers had been asked to step up supplies. Seven Indian companies have licensed the drug from Gilead Sciences, with an installed capacity of about 3.9 million units per month, for local use and exports to more than 100 countries. The companies are: Cipla Ltd, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd, Hetero Labs Ltd, Jubilant Life Sciences Ltd, Biocon Ltd's Syngene, Zydus Cadila Healthcare Ltd and the Indian unit of Mylan . The World Health Organization in November issued a conditional recommendation against the use of Remdesivir in hospitalised patients, regardless of disease severity, saying there was no evidence that the drug improved survival and other outcomes in these patients. Many countries, including India, however, have continued to use it. India leads the world in the daily average number of new infections reported in more than two weeks, accounting for one in every six infections reported globally each day. Deaths have also surged, with the health ministry reporting 839 fatalities on Sunday - the highest in over five months - taking the total to 169,275. India's tally of more than 13.35 million cases is the third-highest globally, behind only the United States and Brazil. India's new infections have soared nearly 18-fold since hitting a multi-month low in early February. India's drug regulator and some state governments have in recent days raised concerns over hoarding and black marketing of Remdesivir, which in some instances is being sold at more than 10 times the maximum retail price. Social media posts on Sunday showed large queues of people in the western state of Gujarat waiting to buy Remdesivir injections for COVID-19 patients. \"Every day the central government is providing 50,000 Remdesivir injections but all of them are getting consumed,\" Rajesh Tope, health minister of India's hardest-hit Maharashtra state, told reporters this week.  \"Pharmacists and stockists might be doing black marketing and that needs to be checked.\" The federal health ministry wrote to Maharashtra, which is home to the financial capital Mumbai, asking local authorities to improve COVID-19 testing and deploy more manpower. \"Rostering of health care workers, hiring of contractual health workers need to be expedited,\" the letter from India's top health bureaucrat said, flagging an acute shortage of healthcare workers in seven districts of Maharashtra. Authorities have blamed the resurgence of the virus mainly on crowding and a reluctance to wear masks, even as election rallies and religious gatherings have continued in recent weeks. Thousands of people thronged the banks of the holy Ganges River in Haridwar city on Sunday for prayers during the Kumbh Mela - where up to five million are expected on certain days. Authorities have made it mandatory for all people entering the area to take COVID-19 tests. But many devotees on Sunday gathered by the river without masks, in densely-packed crowds. ", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162803", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45247", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162808", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54751", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.deccanchronicle.com", "section": "Top Stories", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/tollywood/110421/pawan-kalyan-enters-quarantine.html", "title": "Pawan Kalyan enters quarantine", "author": "\n\t\t\tDECCAN CHRONICLE.", "author_link": "", "published_date": "Apr 11, 2021, 10:01 pm IST", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "The Vakeel Saab actor took his doctors’ advice and went into quarantine as a precautionary measure", "text": "After Pawan Kalyan’s personal staff members and security tested positive for the COVID-19, the actor decided to isolate himself on Sunday.

The Cambodia Microfinance Association (CMA) and the Association of Banks in Cambodia (ABC) made the announcement a day after more than 100 NGOs called on Cambodia’s government to direct MFIs and lenders to suspend debt and interest collection for at least three months to allow borrowers the ability to shelter at home as the country struggles to contain a viral spread first discovered in late February. Cambodia, which had largely remained unscathed by the coronavirus in 2020, registered its first death from COVID-19—the disease caused by the virus—last month, a year to the day that that the World Health Organization labeled it a pandemic. Since then, 22 people have died, and Cambodia’s caseload has reached more than 2,900 people. In Tuesday’s statement, the NGOs noted that borrowers are unable to avoid potential exposure to the coronavirus because they fear losing their land or homes if they cannot repay their debt. In particular, they pointed out that while lenders did temporarily suspend repayments of loan principals, they continued to collect interest accrual, allowing them to collect “record profits” during the past year. On Wednesday, the CMA and ABC said that around 340,000 people had been able to restructure loans totaling some U.S. $4 billion since the beginning of the pandemic and that they will continue to assist in restructuring loans based on their clients’ needs. Additionally, they said, clients who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who are in quarantine will be provided temporary forbearance from principal and interest payments. “Those customers who are infected with COVID-19 will not be charged interest or fined for at least one month and their loans will be automatically restructured,” the statement said. “They will also be allowed to delay principal payments for three months, provided they have proof of infection.” Clients in quarantine will be allowed to restructure their loans as well as delay interest and principal payments for one month, the associations said, adding that they will not be fined for late payments. The CMA and ABC also pledged to inject more funding in a bid to reduce interest rates, restructure loans and waive all fines for first-time homebuyers, and grant “forgiveness” to those who have died—without elaborating on how. CMA spokesman Kaing Tongngy told RFA’s Khmer Service in an interview on Wednesday that as the country’s Feb. 20 outbreak has gotten worse, his association has been working to introduce more measures to assist COVID-19 patients over the past few weeks. “If we know the customer has been impacted by COVID-19, we will reach out to them via telephone call and, with their consent, restructure their loans,” he said. Kaing Tongngy said that MFIs and banks consider their customers “long-term business partners,” and are therefore willing to take a loss to help them. “If they win over the customer’s hearts, the customers will continue to support their businesses in the future,” he said. Following the appeal by the more than 100 NGOs on Tuesday, government spokesman Phay Siphan told RFA that the requests were impossible to honor because “Cambodia is a free economic market.” He said debtors and creditors need to determine a path forward between themselves. “The people can’t rely on the government because they didn’t consult with us when they took the loans,” he said. “They need to be responsible for their own fates.”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162808", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11670", "source": "scrapy"},

The   director made the comments during an interview at Chapman University’s Dodge College in Orange, California, reported  . When asked about the incidents of racial discrimination and violence towards Asian people, Bong, who was speaking through a translator from his home in South Korea, said he has an outsider perspective on the issue. \"But as someone who is a part of mankind, as a person, it’s quite fearful to watch the hate crimes against Asian-Americans and the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement,\" he said. Bong said directors and creators should be bolder when dealing with current issues of society. \"I do think about what the film industry can do at this time. With films, creating a film takes a lot of time and a lot of money; it's a big unit that can’t really respond quickly to issues that are currently happening in society,\" he said. \"But ironically, because of that, I think creators and filmmakers can be bolder with dealing with issues and they shouldn’t be afraid to confront them,\" he added. Referring to filmmaker Spike Lee’s 1989 movie  , Bong said the film is a perfect example of how directors can address societal issues through their work. \"Not necessarily to predict what will happen in society, but to use your insight to portray the issues that are currently boiling underneath the surface of society that can explode later on,\" he added. The filmmaker said he tried to follow Lee's method with his 2019 social satire  , which became the first South Korean movie to win the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020. \"For me,   was a film where I tried to take that approach… (the film) talks about the haves and have-nots of our current society. It began with a question of ''what does it mean to be poor or rich in our current times?'' \"As creators and artists, you sort of have to see through the essence and the central questions in our society through the days that you live through and send a reply to those questions through your work,\" Bong said.

Our thoughts are with Your Majesty and the Royal Family during this time of mourning.  Yours sincerely Halimah Yacob 10 April 2021 Your Royal Highness, I was saddened to learn of the passing of your father, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. As we mourn his passing, we remember the significant and remarkable life that he had led, dedicated first and foremost to service to the United Kingdom and its people, as well as to the peoples of the Commonwealth and the world at large. He had an indomitable spirit, fighting for peace and justice in the Second World War in his early years, and later steadfastly pursuing environmental causes, where he was well ahead of the times, and taking a close interest in sports and education. His selfless devotion to service has contributed much to advance and uplift the livelihoods of people in the United Kingdom and within the Commonwealth. We will also remember him for his steadfast support of Her Majesty The Queen.  One of his distinguished achievements was the creation of The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme over six decades ago. The awards nurtured and empowered young people to gain the skills, confidence and resilience to become exceptional individuals who can make a difference and contribute to society. The scheme also inspired Singapore’s own National Youth Achievement Award programme, which was launched in 1992. It was clear that the Duke of Edinburgh made education an utmost priority. He visited the National University of Singapore in 1972, and the United World College of Southeast Asia in 1989. He also met students from the Singapore Sports School during Her Majesty The Queen’s State Visit in 2006, where I had the great pleasure to meet him. On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you my deepest condolences and sympathies for this immense loss. He will be remembered and missed.

Throughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day. We have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh’s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959. The Duke of Edinburgh’s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.

The meeting comes after the group published   on Sunday and again on Wednesday accusing GM of \"systemic racism.\" The adverts, which ran in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Michigan Chronicle and the Detroit Free Press,   for not spending more on Black-owned media and slammed Barra for delegating their repeated requests for a direct meeting to her head of marketing. Signatories of the ad include Weather Channel owner Byron Allen; the rapper, actor and media mogul Ice Cube; and Junior Bridgeman, the owner of Ebony Media. One day after the first ad ran, the group held a brief video conference call with GM’s chief marketing officer, Deborah Wahl, GM spokesperson Pat Morrissey confirmed. That meeting will be followed up by an hour-long web discussion on Thursday. The ads asserted that GM only spends 0.5 percent of its ad budget on Black-owned media properties, while African-Americans make up about 14 percent of the U.S. population. And it said if Barra wouldn't meet with them, she should resign. Allen said the group is looking for GM to sign a $200 million-a-year deal for all Black media, growing annually by 5 percent over the next 10 years. “Mary Barra has the opportunity to be on the right side of history,” Allen told NBC News. He declined to say what the executives might do if GM does not offer an acceptable deal. Allen acknowledged that, by calling out America’s largest automaker, the group hopes to subsequently leverage any agreement to reach deals elsewhere. “Every corporation in America will be held accountable if they don’t do business with Black media in a respectable way,” he said. Morrissey said GM already spends “significantly” more than 0.5 percent with Black-owned media. \"With respect specifically to Black-owned media we increased our spend by 100 percent from 2020 to 2021, and we plan to grow from there. We will continue our efforts,\" he said. \"We are disappointed that Mr. Allen and his fellow signatories resorted to additional paid media advertising to advance a narrative of factual inaccuracies and character assault against our CEO, Mary Barra.\" \"It is particularly perplexing given that the paid advertising appears after the GM team has had repeated meetings with Mr. Allen and his team, and after we had scheduled a meeting between the signatories and Ms. Barra,\" Morrissey said. Benjamin Chavis, CEO and president of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, a trade group for Black media, said GM and Barra are \"taking steps to deal with systemic racism — but it doesn’t happen overnight, or in one year.\" He cautioned that systemic racism remains a major problem and, as much as GM has done, the automaker “and other corporations need to increase their advertising with Black-owned media.” Since becoming GM CEO in January 2015, Barra has declared a goal of creating “the most inclusive company in the world.\" Last week the company appointed two new members to its board of directors: former Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman and Mark Tatum, the deputy commissioner and COO of the National Basketball Association. After the death of George Floyd in police custody last May, Barra wrote a letter to employees saying that she was “impatient and disgusted” by the events and stressed the need to “individually and collectively” act. Last June 19 — known as Juneteenth, the commemoration of the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States — GM asked employees to observe 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the amount of time Chauvin is recorded as having his knee on Floyd's neck during his fatal arrest, as a sign of solidarity with the black community. (Prosecutors at Chauvin's murder trial in Minneapolis this week have said it was actually 9 minutes and 46 seconds.) But the newspaper ads said these moves didn't go far enough to create material change. “You stand on stage, after the death of George Floyd, saying, ‘Black Lives Matter,’ when you have refused to acknowledge us,” the ad says of Barra. “The very definition of systemic racism is when you are ignored, excluded and you don’t have true economic inclusion.” Barra declined a request for comment.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162808", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "41418", "source": "scrapy"},

Genocide, the nations declared, was “condemned by the civilized world” and justified intervention in the affairs of sovereign states. Now, a small but growing number of world leaders including Pope Francis and French President Emmanuel Macron have begun citing an offense they say poses a similar threat to humanity and remains beyond the reach of international criminal law: ecocide, or widespread destruction of the environment. The pope describes ecocide as “the massive contamination of air, land and water,” or “any action capable of producing an ecological disaster,” and   it a sin for Roman Catholics. The Pontiff has also endorsed a campaign by environmental activists and legal scholars to make ecocide the fifth crime before the International Criminal Court in The Hague as a legal deterrent to the kinds of far-reaching environmental damage that are driving mass extinction, ecological collapse and climate change. The monumental step, which faces a long road of global debate, would mean political leaders and corporate executives could face charges and imprisonment for \"ecocidal\" acts. To make their case, advocates point to the Amazon, where fires raged out of control in 2019, and where the rainforest may now be so degraded   than it draws in. At the poles, human activity is thawing a frozen Arctic and destabilizing the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Across the globe, climate change is disrupting the reliable seasonal rhythms that have sustained human life for millennia, while hurricanes, floods and other climate-driven disasters have   in the last six months. Fossil fuel pollution has   annually in recent years, according to a study in Environmental Research, more than tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS combined. One in 4 mammals  . For amphibians, it’s 4 in 10. Damage to nature has become so extensive and widespread around the world that many environmentalists speak of ecocide to describe numerous environmentally devastated hot spots: The campaign to criminalize ecocide is now moving from the fringe of advocacy into global diplomacy, pushed by a growing recognition among advocates and many political leaders that climate change and environmental causes are tied inherently to human rights and social justice. The effort remains a long shot and is at least years from fruition, international and environmental law experts say. Advocates will have to navigate political tensions over whether national governments or the international community have ultimate control over natural resources. And they’ll likely face opposition from countries with high carbon emissions and deep ties to industrial development. The environmentalists must also figure out how criminal law would address climate change, which has been driven by practices like burning coal and gasoline that are not only legal, but central to the global economy. The campaign to make ecocide a crime, however, is about more than law. Jojo Mehta, who launched the Stop Ecocide campaign in 2017 with Polly Higgins, a Scottish lawyer who died in 2019, describes it as a moral and practical issue as well. “We use criminal law to draw moral lines,” Mehta said. “We say something’s not accepted, your murder is not acceptable. And so, simply putting mass damage and destruction of nature below that red line actually makes a huge difference, and it will make a difference to the people that are financing what is going on.” Scott W. Badenoch Jr., an American environmental lawyer who favors the criminalization of ecocide, used the term to describe the state, and fate, of the Earth. “Ecocide is now endemic all over the planet,” he said. “The structures of ecology that have held up living organisms on Earth, since time immemorial, are collapsing everywhere.” He added, “Ecocide is now, frankly, the process that we are living in on Earth.” The concept of ecocide was born of tragedy. Over a period of 10 years, the United States government sprayed   of powerful herbicides, including Agent Orange, across the countryside in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to expose enemy sanctuaries during the Vietnam War. The dioxin-laced chemicals defoliated verdant jungle and caused cancers, neurological disease and birth defects in people living nearby. While the number of victims is disputed,   there are more than 3 million. In 1970, Yale biologist Arthur Galston invoked the destruction to call on the world to outlaw what he called “ecocide.” More than 20 years later, the global community came together to form the International Criminal Court, which was formally established in 2002 under a treaty called the Rome Statute to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes when its member countries, which currently  , fail to do so themselves. Early drafts of the Rome Statute included the crime of environmental destruction,   after opposition from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, based on various concerns, including that it wasn’t precisely defined. Instead, it was relegated to a wartime offense that has never been enforced. As a result, international criminal law includes few guardrails to prevent peacetime environmental destruction. “There's a big gap and something needs to fill it,” said Badenoch, a visiting attorney at the Environmental Law Institute. “We currently cannot hold big corporations or big governments accountable for ecocide,” Badenoch added. “So, what do you do? We name and shame — that's all we've got.” Decades of oil extraction in Nigeria by subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell, for example, have   in parts of the country with benzene and other toxic pollutants, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Civil lawsuits have taken years to wind through European courts, and no laws were strong enough to prevent the damage from happening, though Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary was recently  . Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman,   that says many of the spills have come as a result of sabotage and theft, and that the company has been working with stakeholders to clean up the pollution identified by the U.N. Environment Program. The International Criminal Court's supranational authority would make an ecocide crime particularly powerful, said Kate Mackintosh, executive director of the Promise Institute for Human Rights at the University of California Los Angeles. An ecocide crime would require International Criminal Court members to enact their own national ecocide laws, and failure to enforce those laws would enable the international court to step in. While political leaders and warlords have been the usual targets of the court, an ecocide crime could place business executives on notice, too. “That could make a difference in corporate boardroom conversations,” Mackintosh said. Even the threat of being labeled an international criminal, she said, might deter destructive corporate behavior. “I mean, for PR, it doesn’t look good, does it?” Mackintosh said making ecocide a crime could help in weak states, where corporate polluters are sometimes more powerful than national governments. “The likelihood of any criminal prosecution taking place in that state is pretty low,” she said. “But with an international crime, that’s actually not a bar.” China, the United States, India and Russia — four of the world’s top polluters — are not members of the International Criminal Court, but if a corporation based in one of those countries were to operate within a member state, as many of them do, their executives could fall under the court’s jurisdiction. The push to criminalize ecocide remained on the periphery until December 2019, when Vanuatu and the Maldives, two island nations threatened by rising seas and climate change-driven extreme weather, recommended that the court consider amending its statute to “criminalize acts that amount to ecocide.” “Our legacy and our future are at stake,” Vanuatu’s ambassador to the European Union, John Licht,  , stressing a “common bond” that united all the world’s people. “Our lives are intertwined by the environment we live in.” Willy Missack, who has served as part of Vanuatu’s delegation to the United Nations climate negotiations, said diplomats from other countries expressed shock when “little tiny Vanuatu” — a remote archipelago of more than 80 islands in the South Pacific — said it wanted to take on global powers and the fossil fuel industry through the courts. But the fact that corporations can continue to profit from carbon emissions that are threatening his country’s future, Missack said, makes the legal case clear. “It is not right,” he said, “and this is where justice comes in.” After Vanuatu asked the International Criminal Court to consider criminalizing ecocide, Mehta’s Stop Ecocide Foundation independently convened a panel of international legal experts, including Mackintosh of UCLA, to draft a clear definition of ecocide. They plan to publish their definition in June, at which point they hope at least one of the court’s member nations will formally propose that the court adopt ecocide as the fifth international crime against peace. Mehta has said the definition would likely require   of environmental destruction related to practices like widespread logging, drilling, mining and deep-sea trawling. Richard J. Rogers, a British expert in international criminal law who is a partner at Global Diligence and a member of the drafting panel, said it may be relatively straightforward to criminalize certain acts, like destruction of a forest or waterway. But climate change poses a greater challenge: Not only is it difficult to connect polluters to specific harms, he said, but there’s also nothing illegal about extracting or burning fossil fuels. “The situation we're dealing with is that the carbon system, which has fueled our economies since the Industrial Revolution, has not only been lawful, but it's been encouraged,” Rogers said. Another point that the drafters will have to grapple with is whether the crime of ecocide should require prosecutors to prove that humans have been harmed. Mackintosh said that while this “human harm” threshold could prove appealing politically — the court's existing crimes all largely involve harm to humans — focusing ecocide only on the environment could make it easier for prosecutors to prove, especially when it comes to harms related to climate change, which are often incremental and indirect. If a nation agrees to introduce the ecocide proposal to the International Criminal Court for consideration, that is when even harder work will begin. Ratification is a multistep process that would require support from either two-thirds or seven-eighths of the court’s members, depending on the type of amendment introduced. (Vanuatu still supports the campaign, but Covid-19 and the country’s “limited resources for international diplomacy” have put its ecocide advocacy on hold, said Dreli Solomon, a spokesman for Vanuatu’s embassy in Brussels.) While no country has committed to formally proposing that the court adopt ecocide, the campaign is gaining traction, fueled by the youth-led climate movement and radical new groups like Extinction Rebellion. In December, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès asked International Criminal Court member states to   of adopting ecocide as a crime. A member of Belgium’s Parliament has also proposed a bill to criminalize ecocide. And French lawmakers are working on legislation to make ecocide an   punishable by fines and prison, though Stop Ecocide   as “weak.” At least 10 countries have national ecocide laws already, including Vietnam, which enacted the law in 1990. Separately, French lawyers in January filed a request on behalf of Amazonian indigenous groups asking the International Criminal Court to investigate Bolsonaro of Brazil for crimes against humanity. The appeal alleges that deforestation encouraged by Bolsonaro’s government and other policies have forced indigenous people from their homes and even led to murders in the region. While the request relies on citations of crimes the court already addresses, the lawyers who submitted it     the case is also an example of ecocide. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said in a statement that \"the Bolsonaro administration is taking concrete action to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples and ensure the future of the Amazon.\" The embassy said that over 70 percent of the eligible Indigenous population has received initial Covid-19 vaccinations and that deforestation rates in the Amazon were 21 percent lower from August to January , compared to the same period a year earlier. Badenoch said that while the hurdles to adopting a new international crime are high, they are not insurmountable. “These things take a long time and they are complex,” he said. “But they can be done.” While the campaign for an ecocide law could take years — if it is successful at all — advocates say the effort could bear fruit much sooner: The ecocide campaign has thrust the concept into public discussion. Mehta doesn’t expect the campaign to catch fire in the United States, but after four years of President Donald Trump, she’s heartened by the arrival of John Kerry, Biden’s special climate envoy. “We don’t expect the U.S. to join the ICC any time soon, but that said, the conversation around ecocide itself, we don’t see any reason why it can’t start happening in the U.S.,” she said. The State Department released a statement saying that the U.S. “regularly engages with other countries” on “the importance of preventing environmental destruction during armed conflict,” but added, “We do not comment on the details of our communications with foreign governments.” Mehta’s campaign is also part of a wider effort by activists who have been looking to the courts to force more aggressive action on climate change. As of July 1, 2020, at least 1,550 climate change cases have been filed in 38 countries,  . In 2015, a Dutch court ruled in the Urgenda Climate Case that the government had acted negligently by failing to take aggressive enough action to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the ruling in   in 2019 and ordered the government to hit specific emissions reductions targets, sparking a series of similar lawsuits in other countries. In one of those lawsuits, a Paris administrative court  for failing to meet its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling relied, in part, on France’s nonbinding commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, taking what had been the soft pledge of politics and turning it into a legally binding commitment. Mehta has framed an ecocide law as a counterweight to the failings of the Paris Agreement, saying in   that it offers “a way to correct the shortcomings” of the global climate pact. “Whereas Paris lacks sufficient ambition, transparency and accountability, the criminalization of ecocide would be an enforceable deterrent.” Alex Whiting, a professor at Harvard Law School and former coordinator of prosecutions at the International Criminal Court, said that making ecocide a crime before the court would have tremendous impact, even if only a few cases were actually prosecuted. “When a crime becomes an international crime, it has a ripple effect,” he said. “The environment is the issue of our time. Being able to do something about that seems important.” In Vanuatu, though, there is a sense that the pace of climate change is beginning to outrun the country’s ability to adapt. Cyclones that have devastated the islands are expected to intensify as the globe continues to warm. Missack, the Vanuatu diplomat, said the effects of climate change run much deeper than damage from storms. Most of the country’s residents depend on the crops they grow and the fish they catch, so their lives are intertwined with the environment around them. Recently, the harvest of yam, a key crop that is  , was disrupted, throwing it out of alignment with the seasonal and celestial markers and accompanying rituals that normally tell farmers when to reap. “One day we will talk about the stars, and this is how the ritual goes. But it will never be the same spirit, the same soul of the ritual,” Missack said. “And that loss, none of the money in this world can pay for it.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_13/3461066/210331-ecocides-main-cover-cs_2ebc05549a4dd05c1b18fcee33fee8aa.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Photo illustration of Deepwater Horizon, Amazon fires, city pollution, ocean oil spill and refinery exhaust.\" height=\"1250\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162813", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "65129", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.dnaindia.com", "section": "advertise", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-ipl-2021-srh-vs-kkr-kolkata-knight-riders-ride-home-despite-jonny-bairstow-manish-pandey-s-efforts-2885891", "title": "IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey's efforts", "author": null, "author_link": "/authors/dna-web-team", "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Kolkata Knight Riders defended the 187-run total as Andre Russell and Prasidh Krishna bowled well at the death to restrict Sunrisers Hyderabad.", "text": "Kolkata Knight Riders have opened their account with a win against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in their first game of the 2021 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).   side defended the 187-run target by 10 runs as it proved to be too much for Manish Pandey in the end after they lost a few wickets in quick succession. Pandey anchored the innings for the Sunrisers with a 44-ball 61* with a strike rate of 138, but the target needed for him to play a little bit quicker as it put too much pressure on the other batsmen to get going from the outset. Hard-hitting all-rounder Abdul Samad did hit a couple of lusty blows after coming in at No 7 was it was too late as the required run-rate had gone out of the reach for the SRH side. They didn't have a great start to their innings both the openers by the third over, however, a 92-run partnership between Jonny Bairstow and Pandey came to the rescue for the Sunrisers. Both brought up their fifties and after settling down took the attack to the KKR bowlers. However, Bairstow got restless after playing three dots in the 13th over bowled by Pat Cummins and he hit straight into the hands of the backward point fielder.  The wicket came at the right moment for the KKR but wrong for the SRH as they just started to amp up towards the 188-run target on a slowish pitch. Sunrisers then lost a couple of more wickets and the innings suddenly lost the momentum and it got to a sluggish end and they fell short of the target despite Pandey and Samad being there at the end. Earlier,   played a decisive cameo of 22 runs off just 9 balls to help KKR finish on a high after they lost four wickets in just 14 runs. Nitish Rana and Rahul Tripathi stitched a 93-run partnership to give KKR much-needed momentum as the duo ripped apart the Sunrisers' bowlers.

The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, however, did not clearly spell out the subject of Netanyahu’s discussions with Modi in its press release. Netanyahu has announced a package of 10 billion NIS (USD 2.86 billion) to facilitate economic activity in the midst of challenges posed by the spread of the virus. “The Israeli economy is in a better situation than most economies in the world: Unemployment is low, growth is high and the debt to GDP ratio is good,” Netanyahu said. “However, we have a great challenge here that we all are feeling and which we are all aware of. In our view, we can also deal with it in a way that will allow us to get through it successfully in peace,” he said.  “Not without difficulty, and not without sacrifice, but in the end, in peace, and I think that we can do this together in an optimal manner,” Netanyahu asserted . The package lays special stress on the health sector and other businesses impacted by the coronavirus such as tourism and the aviation sector. It outlines financial assistance provisions for businesses affected by the global menace.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/22/114364-untitled-design-25.jpg?itok=Z0uE-09k\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162814", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21351", "source": "scrapy"},

Speaking to reporters after a closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders on Saturday, Mr Lee said: “I told them that I had concluded that we should prepare to make such a move for nurses because people's attitudes have changed, because in social and work settings, the tudung is now more common. \"And on its own, we can see the merits of allowing ... Muslim nurses to wear the tudung with their uniform if they wish.” He added that the community leaders knew that the Government has been considering allowing Muslim nurses to wear the tudung for “quite some time”, because the Government has been “engaging and consulting them quietly”. But before the change is made, the Government will need to “prepare the ground”, said the Prime Minister. “We have to make sure that everybody understands this is a careful adjustment. Not a wholesale change, and we want people to realise what the limits are, as we make these changes,” Mr Lee added. “And we must make sure that Singaporeans, both Muslims and non-Muslims, are ready to accept the move.” The process will “take a bit of time”, and Mr Lee has asked the community leaders to help the Government with the process over the next few months. “I hope that by the National Day Rally, which will be at the end of August, we should be ready to make a decision, and I shall have something to report,” said the Prime Minister. The closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders was the Prime Minister’s first such dialogue since 2014, when the subject of wearing the tudung was also raised. “Today we had a candid and sincere discussion, focusing more specifically on tudung for nurses. But, of course, going beyond that too,” said Mr Lee. He thanked them for “walking with the Government on this complex journey” and for helping them to manage an important issue. “We are a multiracial and multireligious country. It's a delicate balance, but we are fully committed to preserving our harmony, and to maintaining our common space,” he said. “We want to avoid creating unintended consequences … when we make well intentioned moves.” Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the dialogue was “constructive and candid” and that the community leaders got to hear what the Government’s position and considerations are. He added that there was a common understanding that this issue must be approached carefully because it involves racial and religious sensitivities. \"Therefore, we cannot rush to a decision. At the heart of the matter is how we strike a good balance in allowing our nurses to put on the tudung with their uniform, so that this decision can win the support of all communities, preserve common space and at the same time strengthen our social cohesion,\" he said. He added that in doing so, the Government hoped it can support the request by nurses to don the tudung with their uniform. “We know, we empathise that they want to lead meaningful religious lives daily, because this is also their religious identity,” said Mr Masagos. “Our racial and religious harmony is precious and the Malay Muslim community will safeguard these together with the rest of Singaporeans. We’ll continue to engage Singaporeans on this matter. “I hope to seek everyone's support as we deliberate on this issue, and work towards an outcome that’s acceptable to all Singaporeans.” Mr Masagos added that the Government has “always empathised” with the request by nurses to put on their tudung with their uniform. “But we have to be very careful, because it is not just about the Muslim request alone. Any move, any change in our society must be (carried) very carefully, because it involves interaction with other people,” he added. He said it is a “whole-of-government” approach and that they are reaching out to “every stakeholder” on this issue. Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam in March signalled a likely change in the Government's stance on nurses wearing the tudung, and said they were consulting the community. MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) had raised the issue in Parliament earlier this year. Mr Masagos answered on Mar 8 that the Government would continue to have discussions and consultations with the community behind closed doors. Mufti Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said on Saturday the tudung issue is about balancing the religious needs of communities. \"For example, in this case, the needs of Muslim nurses who choose to put on the tudung, while maintaining a high level of trust and confidence between communities,\" he said. \"So conversations between Government and community leaders and religious leaders are very important for us to consider the full range of perspectives, as well as context for the considerations involved before moving to shift the policy.\" He said it is very important that they “should not make a move that may undermine” Singapore's social cohesion, but instead to continue to strengthen it and \"enlarge our common spaces\". \"I think due to the hard work of our communities in forging greater trust and confidence, we are in a better position now to move on with such a change, and I hope that we will continue to give the support, working together with the relevant agencies to ensure that this policy shift will only result in a stronger and more united society,\" he said. Madam Rahayu Mohamad, a MUIS council member and former president of the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS), said Muslim women who wish to \"observe their religious prescription\" would welcome the move.  \"The women that we actually talked to are educated and they're well informed, and the reason why they are still in these sectors is because they understand and (understand) very well in terms of the decision and the choices that they're making,\" she said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162814", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48108", "source": "scrapy"},

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming  . BHG Holdings also reported a 40 to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods, to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours.   The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners. Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.  From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020. It stands at 10 per cent now.  Property tax rebates passed on by property owners have dried up. Although retail rent is expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.  Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm. Perhaps it also knows not keeping up risks losing loyal customers to competing malls.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/9068518/1957a42a2a1da80ba693669103d71585/sing-tien-foo-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Sing Tien Foo \">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162814", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "49262", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.seelatest.com", "section": "sports", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.seelatest.com/olympic/fifa-u-17-womens-world-cup-dates-out", "title": "\n                                        ", "author": "\n                                                                                        By ", "author_link": "https://www.seelatest.com/author/nehasinha", "published_date": "\n                                        ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup to be played between 17th February 2021 & 7th March 2021.

Amid the coronavirus scare, rumours have been circulating online about potential cures against the virus, alcohol being one of them. The child also lost his eye-sight in the process. Media reports indicated that the child was given booze by his family. Videos of the incident have been making rounds across social media. With the coronavirus death toll increasing everyday across the globe, many people have slipped into panic mode.  In the recent weeks, over 200 people have died in Iran after drinking alcohol. Most people procured the alcohol from bootleggers who dilute the alcohol and mix additives in it, which can have life-threatening reactions. In the video, a medical professional standing by the child’s bed can be heard claiming that the family had given the alcohol to him as a protective measure against coronavirus. Additionally, the doctor said that the child can no longer see and is in a coma. “I beg of you, do not give alcohol to your children. It is very dangerous,” he added. Due to the ban on alcohol in Iran, people are forced to make their alcohol or to buy it from bootleggers through illegal channels, which makes it very dangerous to consume. The ban was enforced in Iran starting 1979 but people prefer to resort to making alcohol at home. However, the homemade variants of alcohol have an extremely lethal concentration of methanol. Others drink industrial alcohol that comes in fruit flavours and is easily available across supermarkets. However, industrial alcohol is used as an alternative fuel soerce and as a pesticide, with high concentrations of methanol. Alcohol poisoning is capable of causing permanent blindness, brain damage, and heart attacks if left out of check.   The COVID-19 pandemic has killed over 1,556 people in Iran, and has infected more than 20,000 people. As of Saturday, 1,812 in Iran have died from coronavirus, and there are 23,049 confirmed cases. Over 127 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. As of now, based on the Johns Hopkins University tracker, at least 341,000 people have been infected with COVID-19. Around 14,700 have died.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also written to the education minister to consider the demands of students for cancelling the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams. Vadra said that its 'shocking' that the CBSE has decided to go ahead with exams despite parents expressing fears and 'apprehensions' about assembling at exam centres in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. She said these 'apprehensions' are not 'Unreasonable', so exams should be cancelled. She, in her letter said, \"It will be practically impossible to ensure the safety of students at large and at crowded exam centres.

A unilateral decision by any state would lead to students of that state being at a disadvantage in terms of career and opportunities, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said in a letter, dated April 10, addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. \"Your intervention would mean national consensus, instead of a unilateral decision by any particular state,\" Sawant said in his letter.

The longer-term impact of the reopening boom won’t be known until years into the future, he said, because it will take time to ascertain the quality of government spending, including President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill. “Spent wisely, it will create more economic opportunity for everyone,” he said. Dimon, 65, weighed in on a range of topics familiar to watchers of the country’s most prominent banker: He promoted JPMorgan’s efforts to create economic opportunities for Americans who have been left behind, highlighted threats to U.S. banks’ dominance from fintech and Big Tech players, and opined on public policy and the role of corporations to help bring about change. While Dimon called stock market valuations “quite high,” he said that a multi-year boom may justify current levels, because markets are pricing in economic growth and excess savings that make their way into equities. While he is bullish for the economy’s immediate future, there are serious challenges ahead for the U.S., Dimon said. The country has been tested before, through conflicts starting with the Civil War, the Great Depression and the societal upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s, he said. “In each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors,” Dimon said. “This time may be different.” The past year highlighted challenges for U.S. institutions, elected officials and families, as rivals see a “nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality — and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals.” The country ultimately needs to “move beyond our differences and self-interest and act for the greater good,” Dimon said. “The good news is that this is fixable.” He also addressed inequality in the education system, \"terrible\" infrastructure and \"poorly designed\" social safety nets. \"It is hard to look at these issues in their totality and not conclude that they have a significant negative effect on the great American economic engine,\" Dimon said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3462671/210407-jamie-dimon-al-0755_eae68b742780e5dbd7e2d8a534fafa74.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Jamie Dimon\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162814", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "39732", "source": "scrapy"},

Less than half that number said yes.", "text": "BESSEMER, Ala. — Amazon warehouse workers here voted overwhelmingly against forming a union Friday after a monthslong campaign in which labor had hoped to make inroads into the sprawling company. As of Friday morning, 1,798 employees voted against unionizing, compared to 738 in favor. If it had been approved, the union would have been the first in the United States for Amazon, the country's second-largest employer. Even as the vote was being completed, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, the union seeking to represent the 5,800 workers in Bessemer, said it would challenge the vote by filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. It will allege that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity in the run-up to the election. “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon's behavior in corrupting this election,\" said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU. “Working people deserve better than the way Amazon has conducted itself during this campaign. This campaign has proven that the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is to join together in a union. However, Amazon’s behavior during the election cannot be ignored and our union will seek remedy to each and every improper action Amazon took. We won’t rest until workers' voices are heard fairly under the law.\" Amazon disputed these charges in a blog   after the vote concluded. \"It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,\" the post read. \"Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.\" After the seven-week window to vote by mail ended March 29, the NLRB spent two weeks checking the eligibility of ballots and counting them in a process observed by the union and Amazon. Out of 5,876 eligible voters, 3,041 ballots were cast, but 505 were set aside as contested, mostly by Amazon, according to the union. Ballots can be contested by Amazon or the union based on factors like illegible signatures or questions about whether employees' job titles entitle them to vote. Those ballots are counted only if the final margin is small enough. Labor experts said the results are not a surprise, given the resources Amazon has invested in countering organizing. \"It's so hard for workers to win in a situation like this,\" said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \"The most likely outcome in these situations is that the employer successfully busts the union by instilling fear and uncertainty into the workers, and even those workers that were initially in favor of organizing into a union get afraid and change their mind.\" The Bessemer warehouse, which opened in March 2020, is Amazon's first fulfillment center in Alabama. Workers started organizing toward a union vote in August, hoping it would help improve their working conditions. Currently, it is difficult to go to the bathroom without being penalized, said Jennifer Bates, an Amazon worker in Bessemer, who said she was inspired to support the union effort after regularly having seen her colleagues walk out of work limping from the physical toll the job takes. At the start of this year, Amazon launched what labor experts characterized as a classic, well-funded anti-union campaign at the warehouse. Workers said they were required to attend multiple meetings during their shifts, in which Amazon representatives explained why a union was not, in their view, beneficial for workers. Posters all over the warehouse, some of them in bathroom stalls, encouraged workers to vote no. The company also distributed buttons and stickers for employees to wear, and it created a website and a hashtag, #DoItWithoutDues, highlighting how workers might have to pay $500 in annual dues to the union. Amazon has a  . In 1999, the Communication Workers of America started a campaign to unionize 400 customer service employees in Seattle. After months of anti-union campaigning, Amazon closed down the call center in 2000 in what the company said was a restructuring related to the dot-com bust. In 2014, 21 equipment technicians at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware   following what the union spokesman described as \"intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants.\" Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako   at the time that the \"no\" vote against third-party representation showed that employees \"prefer a direct connection with Amazon.\" Workers in Bessemer who opposed the union seemed to question its purpose. LaVonette Stokes, who works as a labor organizer for the Alabama teachers union when she's not working at Amazon, and her husband are have positions as mid-level process guides that earn $15 to $19 an hour. But she said that a union for unskilled labor in Bessemer makes no sense and that it would move too slowly. She and her husband spent $2,400 of their own money to print flyers that detailed Amazon's benefits. \"We're talking about a union that has made contracts where, yes, they got a raise, but it took them about five to seven years before they even got to that raise,\" she said. Her husband, William, said: \"We're not against unions. We're against this particular union, and we're against a union at this particular facility. Everything that this union is offering, we can do ourselves.\" Workers in favor of the union said they had hoped it would help improve their working conditions, providing better job security and benefits when Amazon is   in part because of a pandemic-induced boom in online retail. \"I like my job. I give it 110 percent every day I go in there, regardless how hard it is, how stressful it is,\" said Darryl Richardson, a worker at the Bessemer warehouse. \"But I feel like employees deserve better and more for what they do.\" Richardson said he and other pro-union workers expect to be fired or forced to quit their jobs. \"I have to move on, and I hate it,\" he said. \"It's sad that you do everything you can to try to make things better for the people and you feel like you are going to lose your job.\" Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, said in an email, \"We respect all our employees' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment.\" Amazon spokesperson Leah Seay said that in Bessemer receive health care coverage and hourly pay of at least $15.30, which is well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Alabama has no minimum wage law. Employees also get a retirement plan, Seay said. Despite the ultimate vote against unionizing, the drive attracted global attention to conditions for Amazon's warehouse workers and the  , said Givan, the Rutgers professor. \"Workers around the country who have been watching what's happening will be potentially inspired by what can happen if you do take action and get national attention,\" she said. It also drew attention from other unions. Following the results, Randy Korgan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Director for Amazon praised workers' attempts to unionize. “Despite going up against one of the world’s richest men in a country with weak labor laws, the workers in Bessemer brought national attention to issues that many non-union workers face in this industry,\" said Korgan. \"This fight is not over, and the Teamsters will always support workers who want to build power by standing together and demanding dignity, a safe workplace, and a fair return on their work.” Analysts said efforts to unionize at other Amazon warehouses in the U.S. are likely to continue, particularly in higher-cost states like New York and California. RWDSU spokesperson Chelsea Connor said the union received over a thousand inquiries about organizing from Amazon workers at other facilities since the organizing effort began. \"Amazon is already about the best-paying job a non-skilled laborer can get in Alabama,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"But in higher-costs states, it's barely a living wage. \"It will cut into profits,\" he said. \"But it's a humane thing to do.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202104/1617986891265_ott_now_amazon_210409_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162815", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.foxnews.com", "section": "us", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cheney-gaetzs-sex-trafficking-allegations-sickening-mother-to-daughters", "title": "Cheney calls Gaetz allegations 'sickening,' stays mum on calls for resignation", "author": "By", "author_link": "", "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Cheney declines to say if she was surprised by the allegations", "text": "said Sunday she found the sexual misconduct allegations against fellow", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/10/340/340/danielle-wallace-headshot.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1\" alt=\"Danielle Wallace\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162803", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "20101", "source": "scrapy"},

Delta first started blocking middle seats and limiting capacity on smaller planes in April near the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other airlines had similar policies, including Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines, but they have since gone back to selling all seats. Physically distancing from other passengers is extremely difficult on an airplane. Delta and other carriers have repeatedly said filtration systems and intense cleaning make it unlikely that travelers will catch Covid-19 on a plane. But Delta said many travelers choose Delta over other airlines because it kept its policy in place. CEO Ed Bastian said in announcement that 65% of customers who flew Delta in 2019 said they expect to have at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by May 1 and that that is “giving us the assurance to offer customers the ability to choose any seat on our aircraft, while also introducing new services, products and rewards to support the journey.” The change comes just as what an improved summer travel season approaches. Generally the most lucrative time of year, airlines suffered as many potential customers stayed home last year. But with vaccines rolling out across the country, airline executives are upbeat about an increase in bookings for late spring and summer trips. Delta announced a host of other changes aimed to drum up revenue. Tickets valid until the end of this year as well as all tickets purchased this year would be valid until the end of 2022. Delta also said its customers can earn as much as 75% more to get to Medallion Status. The carrier and its rivals’ frequent flyer programs have become more important during the pandemic. These programs make money by selling miles to banks, which customers earn when they use rewards credit cards. Delta last year raised a then-record $9 billion in debt backed by its SkyMiles program.

Ted Kennedy's notorious car ride on Chappaquiddick Island. Anne Beatts. “She was witty, and she was good at editing. It was a good team,” Shuster said of Beatts, who died Wednesday at age 74. Unlike Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner and other cast members Beatts and Shuster wrote for, Beatts wasn't widely known to the public and could be reached in her final years simply by emailing her at Chapman University, where she taught comedy writing. But among her peers, and generations of writers and performers who followed, she was a pioneer, a force, and an easy rebuttal to the undying prejudice that women can't be funny. From 1975-80, Beatts and Shuster worked on such recurring sketches as the creepy babysitter Uncle Roy (played by Buck Henry) and Aykroyd's equally perverse Fred Garvin. But their most lasting creation was the Nerds — snivelly Lisa Loopner (Radner) and snotty Todd DiLaMuca (Bill Murray). The Nerds were an act, and a kind of diary. Shuster and Beatts, who later created the groundbreaking teen sitcom  , both identified as nerds and their writing often played against the real-life, ever-changing romance between Radner and Murray. “The dynamic between Billy and Gilda was fabulous,” Shuster told   during a phone interview following Beatts' death. The writing process itself was exhausting, hilarious and sometimes infuriating. Female comedy writers were rare at the time, and getting their ideas even listened to left their heads scarred “from bashing them against the glass ceiling,” Shuster said. John Belushi, who was otherwise friendly with Beatts and Shuster, was so resistant to material written by women that Shuster deliberately left her name off a sketch she wrote with James Downey to ensure the actor would work in it. “It was hard getting writing from a female point of view accepted,” Shuster said. If the glass ceiling didn't quite break in the 1970s, Beatts threw some big rocks. Shuster remembers one of their first meetings with Michaels, Shuster's husband at the time, when Beatts insisted they be paid as much as the male writers. Another time, Shuster and Beatts were at a restaurant coming up with ideas for the show when a man came by and started hitting on Shuster. Beatts picked up her drink and threw it in the man's face. “She had a lot of courage,” Shuster said. “She got out there and fought for what she believed in, and that was great for me. She could really pitch an idea at a meeting. There was a definiteness about her that made you think you needed to make a mark.” Beatts and Shuster remained in touch over the decades following their time with   and had been speaking recently about getting together after being kept apart for a year by the pandemic. Shuster said she didn't know of any health issues that would have led to her friend's death, the cause of which was still unknown as of Saturday, but that she remembers Beatts sounding different the last time they spoke. “She could be spiky. She could be thorny. Her wit, sometimes it stung,” Shuster said. “But she sounded uncharacteristically gentle and loving, and had none of the edge. This was a softer, gentler Beatts.” Thinking of their partnership from the '70s, she added: \"That was a golden period. It was quite a bond. “We made each other laugh.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Remembering Anne Beatts: Fellow Saturday Night Live writer Rosie Shuster recalls colleague's wit, courage\" alt=\"Remembering Anne Beatts: Fellow Saturday Night Live writer Rosie Shuster recalls colleague's wit, courage\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AnneBeatts-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162810", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "35892", "source": "scrapy"},

They woke up late, off a brilliant sashay in the Argentine circle by captain Manpreet Singh before Harmanpreet Singh slammed in a penalty corner with exactly six seconds left on the clock to equalise 2-2. India then proceeded to dismantle Olympic Champions Argentina 3-2 in the shoot-out to win with an overall score of 5-4 and clinch the first of two Pro League encounters. On the table, India move ahead of Argentina up to fifth in the Pro League standings, with 12 points from seven matches. Argentina sit sixth, with 11 points from 11 games. Argentina were more assured in the first two quarters, enjoying dominance in the midfield thus controlling the flow ensuring that India played with a foot in the defence rather than try and move up. Yet, opportunities were there for India quite early but Mandeep Singh and then Hardik Singh couldn’t control or were caught in the wrong positions. India’s midfield, their area of strength with players like Manpreet, Hardik, Nilakanta Sharma and Vivek Prasad couldn’t figure out a rhythm as the hosts constantly turned over the game to peg India back. Midway, through the first quarter, Dilpreet Singh also had an opportunity but the control was lacking. Argentina captain Pedro Ibarra was hit on the head with blood gushing immediately when he waded into a Mandeep-Gurjant move on top of the circle. There was no malice but Ibarra had to go off and only came back in the second quarter. Argentina moved better, created more chances and looked fluent when rotating the balls across the width of the pitch. Lucas Martinez kept the Indian defence busy while Nicolas Nicolas Keenan was doing the damage with his romps through the middle of the pitch. The numbers in the first quarter told their story with Argentina having four shots at goal to India’s none. Circle entries don’t really matter unless you test the goalkeeper, in this case the remarkable 41-year old Juan Vivaldi, who has been playing for the national team since 2001; players like Hardik, Dilpreet and Vivek Prasad were born around 1999-2000, a few years before Vivaldi’s debut. India’s performance did improve in the second quarter but the thrust and finish that should have come from the sticks off Dilpreet, Mandeep, Gurjant wasn’t seen. In terms of possession, India were ahead with 60 percent but the shots at goal were Argentina’s domain. India took the lead in the 21st minute when Manpreet and Dilpreet moved in tandem with the ball rising dangerously off an Argentina defender. India had their first penalty corner (PC) and Harmanpreet Singh was on target to slot it between Vivaldi’s left pad and the defender. At this moment, India were down to ten men with a yellow card being given to Hardik. In fact, cards would be a talking point for Indian coach Graham Reid at the team meeting. Much of the momentum was lost as India was down to nine and ten players in the last three quarters: Gurjant for a green in the third minute itself and then Hardik (yellow) in the 19th, Gurinder (green) in the 24th, Varun Kumar (yellow) in the 55th and Mandeep (yellow) in the 57th. Argentina captain Ibarra was back in the second quarter and Argentina regained their poise at the back. Two minutes before the break, Argentina found the equaliser off a wonderful break move through the middle of the pitch with a stunning reverse hit from Martin Ferreiro, zipping past a shocked Sreejesh. 26 seconds left in the second quarter, Argentina got their second penalty corner when an Argentina forward was brought down with a lunge. The penalty corner flick was deflected off the Indian runner towards Ferreiro whose shot squeezed through the post and pad; an embarrassing let off by the Indian goalkeeper. Argentina led 2-1 at the end of the second quarter, the frustration visible on Indian coach Reid’s face. For much of the first two quarters, most Indian players were missing which included the forwards, midfield and to a certain extent the defence. Argentina were quite outstanding on the turnovers. In fact, a perfect example was provided by Keenan who came from behind and took a ball being controlled by Harmanpreet and turned it into an attack on the Indian side. The lack of energy was visible upfront when a good move from Gurjant saw a weak, insipid reverse hit from Nilakanta. Manpreet was slowly coming into his own, leaving defensive work to move upwards and create not only moves but a few doubts in the Argentina midfield which till the middle of the third quarter had enjoyed supremacy. In the middle of the fourth quarter, as Argentina looked tired, India gained in strength with Sumit, Lalit Upadhyay and Harmanpreet getting the space for a few forays upfront. The two yellow cards pegged Indian back as for almost seven minutes as they played with nine men. But then, as in the past, many a time, the Indian captain produced a burst of magic. Weaving and bobbing past four Argentinians, a minute on the clock, Manpreet earned a penalty corner, India’s third which led to a fourth PC with exactly six seconds remaining. Harmanpreet’s flick knocked the stick off the Argentine runner but the Indian vice-captain was quick to pick up the rebound and shoot it past Vivaldi for the equaliser and his second goal. India had amazingly turned it around at the death taking the match into a shoot-out where Harmanpreet and Shamsher Singh missed with Lalit, Rupinder and Dilpreet slotting their goals to ensure India clinch a thriller. Japanese coach Siegfried Aikman watching in Kuala Lumpur where he has brought his team for a series of Test games against Malaysia felt ‘India had to low a pace in the first two quarters.’ “They were not prepared for Argentina in the defence as a result if you see Argentina won most of the one-to-one situations early on in the match, thus exerting pressure on the Indians. But by the end, Argentina was looking tired and India refusing to give up won the exchange and also made less mistakes in the build-up.” Aikman also, as in the past, said that no team can now afford to sit on a one or two goal lead. And that was once again shown with India coming through in the last one minute. “I do feel that India are two different sides when they play at home and away. At home, they ride on the energy of the supporters and create more. But away, they need to be sharper and alert because that energy that comes from your core group of fans is missing.” It’s a point that Reid would do well to carry with him when the team leaves for Tokyo. With no overseas fans allowed, India would play without any of their fans. On the contrary, Japan being in India’s pool would have the luxury of their fans inside the stadium. But there are plenty of positives that Aikman saw. “I think the counter-attack was still good. They (India) break at a furious pace and that is the reason why the goal came in the dying seconds. But for India to dominate which they need to in the second game, they have to turn ball possession into creating more and not giving away turn-overs.” Indian captain, the man-of-the-match, said after the game: “I think the most important thing from today is that we never gave up.

The meeting comes after the group published   on Sunday and again on Wednesday accusing GM of \"systemic racism.\" The adverts, which ran in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Michigan Chronicle and the Detroit Free Press,   for not spending more on Black-owned media and slammed Barra for delegating their repeated requests for a direct meeting to her head of marketing. Signatories of the ad include Weather Channel owner Byron Allen; the rapper, actor and media mogul Ice Cube; and Junior Bridgeman, the owner of Ebony Media. One day after the first ad ran, the group held a brief video conference call with GM’s chief marketing officer, Deborah Wahl, GM spokesperson Pat Morrissey confirmed. That meeting will be followed up by an hour-long web discussion on Thursday. The ads asserted that GM only spends 0.5 percent of its ad budget on Black-owned media properties, while African-Americans make up about 14 percent of the U.S. population. And it said if Barra wouldn't meet with them, she should resign. Allen said the group is looking for GM to sign a $200 million-a-year deal for all Black media, growing annually by 5 percent over the next 10 years. “Mary Barra has the opportunity to be on the right side of history,” Allen told NBC News. He declined to say what the executives might do if GM does not offer an acceptable deal. Allen acknowledged that, by calling out America’s largest automaker, the group hopes to subsequently leverage any agreement to reach deals elsewhere. “Every corporation in America will be held accountable if they don’t do business with Black media in a respectable way,” he said. Morrissey said GM already spends “significantly” more than 0.5 percent with Black-owned media. \"With respect specifically to Black-owned media we increased our spend by 100 percent from 2020 to 2021, and we plan to grow from there. We will continue our efforts,\" he said. \"We are disappointed that Mr. Allen and his fellow signatories resorted to additional paid media advertising to advance a narrative of factual inaccuracies and character assault against our CEO, Mary Barra.\" \"It is particularly perplexing given that the paid advertising appears after the GM team has had repeated meetings with Mr. Allen and his team, and after we had scheduled a meeting between the signatories and Ms. Barra,\" Morrissey said. Benjamin Chavis, CEO and president of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, a trade group for Black media, said GM and Barra are \"taking steps to deal with systemic racism — but it doesn’t happen overnight, or in one year.\" He cautioned that systemic racism remains a major problem and, as much as GM has done, the automaker “and other corporations need to increase their advertising with Black-owned media.” Since becoming GM CEO in January 2015, Barra has declared a goal of creating “the most inclusive company in the world.\" Last week the company appointed two new members to its board of directors: former Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman and Mark Tatum, the deputy commissioner and COO of the National Basketball Association. After the death of George Floyd in police custody last May, Barra wrote a letter to employees saying that she was “impatient and disgusted” by the events and stressed the need to “individually and collectively” act.

The longer-term impact of the reopening boom won’t be known until years into the future, he said, because it will take time to ascertain the quality of government spending, including President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill. “Spent wisely, it will create more economic opportunity for everyone,” he said. Dimon, 65, weighed in on a range of topics familiar to watchers of the country’s most prominent banker: He promoted JPMorgan’s efforts to create economic opportunities for Americans who have been left behind, highlighted threats to U.S. banks’ dominance from fintech and Big Tech players, and opined on public policy and the role of corporations to help bring about change. While Dimon called stock market valuations “quite high,” he said that a multi-year boom may justify current levels, because markets are pricing in economic growth and excess savings that make their way into equities. While he is bullish for the economy’s immediate future, there are serious challenges ahead for the U.S., Dimon said. The country has been tested before, through conflicts starting with the Civil War, the Great Depression and the societal upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s, he said. “In each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors,” Dimon said. “This time may be different.” The past year highlighted challenges for U.S. institutions, elected officials and families, as rivals see a “nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality — and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals.” The country ultimately needs to “move beyond our differences and self-interest and act for the greater good,” Dimon said. “The good news is that this is fixable.” He also addressed inequality in the education system, \"terrible\" infrastructure and \"poorly designed\" social safety nets. \"It is hard to look at these issues in their totality and not conclude that they have a significant negative effect on the great American economic engine,\" Dimon said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3462671/210407-jamie-dimon-al-0755_eae68b742780e5dbd7e2d8a534fafa74.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Jamie Dimon\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162824", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "39732", "source": "scrapy"},

Ketchup has always been a staple condiment for Americans, but since the pandemic forced many restaurants to ramp up their takeout game, the demand for those handy individual packets quickly skyrocketed. And the rules of supply and demand have led to a 13 percent increase in ketchup packet prices since 2020, according to the newspaper. Fast-food chains have always handed out these disposable packets, but sit-down restaurants have traditionally placed bottles of ketchup on tables or poured it out into a bowl for customers. With both food service models now competing for packets, or sachets, as industry experts call them, the supply chain has been stretched to its limit. Kraft Heinz is, of course, the most well-known ketchup manufacturer, and the company makes up nearly 70 percent of the U.S. retail market for ketchup, The Wall Street Journal reported. With more people eating at home, ketchup bottle sales have also increased 15 percent in the last year, to over $1 billion in 2020. As a result of the supply chain shortage, many restaurants are limiting the number of packets they give to customers or resorting to purchasing generic ketchup brands they normally don't use. Some popular fast-food chains like Long John Silver's and   have even had to reach out to secondary suppliers for the packets. Steve Cornell, Kraft Heinz’s president of Enhancers, Specialty and Away from Home Business Unit, told  the company is working hard to keep up the demand for those coveted ketchup packets as the takeout industry continues to explode. “The unmatched consumer love for our iconic HEINZ brand as well as our longstanding partnership with the restaurant industry are two responsibilities we take very seriously – which was why we made strategic manufacturing investments at the start of the pandemic to keep up with the surge in demand for ketchup packets driven by the accelerated delivery and take-out trends,\" he wrote in an email statement. Cornell also noted that Kraft Heinz has been looking into new packaging options to help evolve with its industry. \"At the same time, we also fast-tracked future-focused culinary and packaging innovations, as well as further manufacturing expansion plans, as we believe there is an enormous opportunity to grow our brands in the exciting foodservice industry,” he said. Fans of the 150-year-old ketchup brand will recall that Kraft Heinz invented a single-serve ketchup tray called the   in 2011. In November 2020, the brand also launched a   to help offer restaurants a sanitary way to allow customers to dispense their own condiments. Looking ahead to the future, Cornell said the company is banking on its multiple new production lines, which he hopes will yield a 25 percent increase in production, amounting to 12 billion ketchup packets a year.

He has given his view on the current situation of CPEC with respect to Pakistan which is elaborated further in the article.  As per reports, Chinese president Xi Jinping visited the Pakistani capital Islamabad on April 20, 2015, to sign fifty-one memorandums of understanding that formed the core of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that together were worth about $46 billion.  While Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif signed the initial agreement, current Prime Minister Imran Khan dove into the relationship he inherited enthusiasm. “CPEC is a great opportunity for Pakistan. CPEC connects us to China which is one of the biggest markets,” he stated. Also Read-  Asad Umar, his minister of planning, spoke of the benefits Pakistan would reap. “CPEC is being developed in a way that it cannot just be a stimulus to our economic growth but also provides Pakistan basis for regional integration,” Umar said. While the project has come at tremendous cost to Pakistan’s sovereignty—China increasingly looks at and treats Pakistan as a vassal state—perhaps the greatest losers in CPEC are those living in Gilgit–Baltistan. Pakistan seized Gilgit-Baltistan in October 1947, after the new Pakistani government sent military irregulars into the region and seized it along with a portion of Kashmir. Initially, most Gilgitis rejected their inclusion into Pakistan, but Pakistani authorities ran roughshod over their concerns. In the 1949 Karachi Agreement, the government of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir ceded full control over the defense and foreign policy of Gilgit-Baltistan to the Pakistani central government. Twenty-five years later, Islamabad abrogated the State Subject Rule, which prevents outsiders from seeking permanent residency, for Gilgit-Baltistan. The result has been slow-motion sectarian and ethnic cleansing. In 1948, when Pakistan invaded, Gilgit-Baltistan was at least 85 percent Shiite; that number has since fallen dramatically and is now likely below 50 percent.   While CPEC has further pushed Pakistan towards debt trap, it has not lived up to its ambitions, leaving Pakistan to face the inevitability of mortgaging sovereignty further to China or international financial institutions. Gilgit-Baltistan, however, which the Pakistani government touted as the “Gateway to CPEC,” is now symbolic of CPEC’s false promises to the already neglected region.  Should Read-  While Gilgit is geographically essential to CPEC’s success and Pakistani authorities pledged development along the highway, none materialized. Nor did promised opportunities in terms of education, employment and welfare materialize. Instead, Pakistan’s major political parties have siphoned off most of the cash and the associated projects to their own political strongholds in Punjab, Sindh, and other regions. At the last minute, for example, Islamabad dumped plans for a Gilgit-Chitral road in favor of a four-lane, fifty-mile highway between Chakdara to Fatehpur in Swat. Imran Khan even agreed to China sending four hundred thousand construction workers to Gilgit-Baltistan at the expense of local labor. ", "image_url": "<img class=\"img asyncImage\" src=\"https://www.seelatest.com/images/background-seelatest.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.joonsite.com/seelatest/2103041112109170.jpg?width=1200\" alt=\"Bargaining gain for China, CPEC less likely to serve Pakistani interests\" title=\"Bargaining gain for China, CPEC less likely to serve Pakistani interests\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162814", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

This was part of the state government’s fresh guidelines issued by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur following a spike in Covid-19 cases across the state. The government has allowed tourists to visit the state as of now, but has also directed hotel owners and tourists to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures (SoPs) issued by the government, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said. Calling it a matter of concern, the CM said that during the last 45 days, the state has reported 10,690 new COVID-19 cases, while with 120 fatalities the number of deaths have also increased rapidly. Under the new guidelines, devotees in the state have been allowed to visit temples during the Navratri festival but they will have to perform ‘puja’ and ‘darshan’ by maintaining social distancing and using face masks.  However, organising ‘langars’ or community kitchens and ‘jagran’ have been banned by the government. No overcrowding would be allowed in buses and public transport vehicles, the CM said. Earlier this week, the state government had restricted gatherings in marriage ceremonies to 50 people indoor and maximum of 200 in open space while only 50 persons would be allowed to attend funerals. The state currently has 4,659 active cases of COVID-19, as per the Union Health Ministry.

In the midst of this all, China is facing questions from the global community, who are wondering whether China could have averted a global crisis by reporting it early. Recently, many countries including Australia called for independent query into the virus’ origins. China threatened with consumer retaliation.

The initiative is called NinetyToZero, so named for the roughly 90 percent wealth gap between white and Black Americans. Its leaders describe the goal as providing a roadmap for organizations to “counteract centuries of discrimination, segregation, and financial exploitation,” according to the group’s launch plans announced Tuesday. “Every business has a responsibility — and can influence others — to advance racial equity, create opportunities for others and strengthen the communities it serves,” Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ CEO, said in a statement. “Starbucks believes in using our scale for good, and we will address the systemic barriers which keep Americans from reaching their full potential.” Organizations that join NinetyToZero agree to establish internal goals for hiring and promoting Black talent. They also pledge to calculate how much money is spent with Black-owned businesses and in Black-owned financial institutions. “Racial wealth inequity is a threat to child well-being and America’s future,” the Rev. Dr. Starsky Wilson, CEO of the Children’s Defense Fund, another inaugural member, said in a statement. “Institutions committed to the promise of Black children and families must push beyond public statements to concrete action to close the wealth gap.” According to the most recent Federal Reserve statistics available, white families have an average of $171,000 in net worth — including savings, investments and home ownership. For Black families, it’s $17,600. Economists say that closing the racial wealth gap would significantly benefit the nation as a whole. According to a McKinsey & Company report, wealth equity could raise U.S. GDP by $1.5 trillion within 10 years. “The key to narrowing the racial health gap is to narrow the racial wealth gap,” Michelle Williams, Dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which also joined the initiative, said in a statement. “The two go hand in hand, and we will all be the beneficiaries of a more equitable and just society.” Other companies are also working on the issue. United Airlines   that it will open its own flight academy to train 5,000 new pilots this decade, with plans for half of them to be women or people of color to increase diversity at the airline. The foundation Robin Hood, also a member, will incubate the initiative, which will accept other member organizations beyond the 10 inaugural groups announced Tuesday. Further research for new practices that can be used to reduce the racial wealth gap will come from another initiative member, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Also part of NinetyToZero’s inaugural class of organizations: The ACLU, Lord Abbett, McKinsey & Co., and SKDKnickerbocker. “Closing the racial wealth gap is more than a zero-sum game,” Robin Hood CEO Wes Moore said in a statement. “When Black families have economic security and agency, everyone benefits. Now is the time to be reflective, bold and transparent.

The DA for the central government employees will be put on hold till June 2021. While announcing the decision, the Centre said that they will continue to announce DA on time but it won't get added to central government employee's salary till June 2021. However, the three installments of DAs - January to June 2020, July to December 2020 and January to June 2021 - will be restored and they will be added to CGS' salary and it will further increase the monthly PF contribution or PF balance in the long term. How? Monthly Provident Fund (PF) contribution is calculated on the basis of a central government's basic salary plus DA. The DA hike will lead to rise in one's monthly PF contribution. As per the AICPI (All India Consumer Price Index) latest data, a 4 percent DA hike for January to June 2021, 3 percent DA for January to June 2020, and 4 percent DA for July to December 2020 can be expected to get added in central government employees' existing DA, which is currently at 17 percent. If the DA is not delayed anymore, then it can go up to 28 percent from 17 percent. The rise in DA from 17 percent to 28 percent will further increase the PF contribution and it will also make changes in the employees' monthly salary as monthly PF contribution is decided on the basis of one's basic salary plus DA. The 52 lakh central government employees along with 58 lakh retired central government employees or pensioners will also get Dearness Relief (DR) benefit restoration as the Centre has frozen both DA and DR till June 2021.

Critics say   courts often work in favour of the rich and powerful while delivering swift and harsh sentences on ordinary people for minor offences.  But it is virtually unheard of for judges to criticise the system. Kanakorn Pianchana, a judge at Yala court in the heart of the insurgency-battered Thai south, was delivering the verdict for five Muslim suspects in a gun murder case on Friday afternoon. He acquitted the group, delivered a courtroom plea for a cleaner justice system, before pulling out a handgun and shooting himself in the chest.  \"You need clear and credible evidence to punish someone. So if you're not sure, don't punish them,\" the judge said addressing the court and broadcasting his words on his phone on Facebook live. \"I'm not saying that the five defendants didn't commit the crimes, they might have done so... But the judicial process needs to be transparent and credible... punishing wrong people makes them scapegoats.\" The Facebook feed then cut, but witnesses said Kanakorn recited a legal oath in front of the former Thai king's portrait, before shooting himself in the chest. \"He is being treated by the doctors and is out of danger,\" Suriyan Hongvilai, the spokesman of the Office of the Judiciary, told AFP on Saturday. \"He shot himself because of 'personal stress'. But the cause behind the stress is not clear and will be investigated,\" he said. ''No Thai judge has ever breached protocol by making similar statements on the wider justice system'', he added. A lawyer working with the suspects said Judge Kanakorn had ruled the prosecutor's evidence was insufficient to convict.  \"Right now the five are still being detained and are waiting to see if the state prosecutor appeals their acquittal,\" Abdulloh Hayee-abu, of the Muslim Attorney Centre in Yala told AFP.  Over 7,000 people have died in 15 years of conflict in the Malay-Muslim majority southern region.  Thousands of suspects have been jailed for acts linked to the insurgency, many under emergency laws imposed on the restive region. Advocacy groups in the Thai south have long accused security forces of trumping up charges against Muslim suspects and using emergency laws to drive cases through the courts.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/05/112412-untitled-design-6.jpg?itok=Flr62O30\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162827", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21397", "source": "scrapy"},

Impoverished Laos has ploughed ahead with ambitious dam-building projects that critics say lack transparency and stringent safety measures.

Pope Francis arrived in   on Wednesday and has a busy agenda Thursday meeting officials and the Thai king before he leads a mass in the evening.  There was no word from his team on whether he felt the quake.  Powerful earthquakes occasionally strike hard in Southeast Asia.

The agreement, which also includes the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx, opens a 30-day window for negotiations to be finalised. If accountants and attorneys for both sides agree, the deal would then need to be approved by the league.  first reported the $1.5 billion sale. Under the conditions of the deal, Taylor would keep control of the club for the next two years and bring on Rodriguez and Lore as partners until a handover in 2023. In a phone interview with  , Taylor said their connection went \"terrifically well\" and that he was \"happy\" and excited\" about what's to come. \"They've asked that I would be there for any decisions that would need to be made,\" Taylor said. \"I would enjoy that. I love teaching people. These are a couple of very bright guys, and I think it could be helpful to the club and I think I could be helpful to them so that they feel confident once they take over 100%.\" Taylor, who put the teams on the market last year, said he was first approached by Rodriguez and Lore a week ago. The pair travelled to meet Taylor and his wife at their winter home in Naples, Florida. Taylor, who turns 80 on 20 April, has spoken with numerous suitors over the years but taken a deliberate approach to finding a buyer he's comfortable with. He said he's done that with Rodriguez and Lore. \"I was concerned if I got ill or something happened to me what would happen to the club. This gives me a path that I know it's going to happen. I feel confident that they'll take care of the franchise and move it ahead,\" Taylor said. Throughout the sale process, he told interested parties that keeping the franchises in town was a prerequisite for purchase. \"There was no use talking to them if they didn't agree to that,\" Taylor said. The Timberwolves, who entered the league in 1989 as an expansion club, were on their way to New Orleans in 1994 before Taylor, a lifelong Minnesotan who built his fortune from a small commercial printing business, bought the team for $88 million. As part of the renovations at Target Center that were initiated in 2016, the team's lease with the city of Minneapolis carries a $50 million penalty if it were to be broken prior to 2035. Rodriguez and Lore are 50-50 partners in the deal, Taylor said. The 45-year-old Rodriguez hit 696 home runs over 22 major league seasons, with the New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers. His last season on the field was 2016, marking the end of marvellous career that was tainted by performance enhancing drug use he later admitted to. Rodriguez was suspended for the entire 2014 season for violating Major League Baseball policy. Lore became Walmart's e-commerce chief in 2016, when the retail giant bought his Jet.com startup in an attempt to boost online business. Lore notified Walmart on 31 January of his intent to leave the company. The 49-year-old Lore will continue to serve in a consulting role as a strategic adviser through September. Rodriguez and Lore confirmed the agreement in a statement distributed to  . \"We look forward to entering this phase of the process with Glen Taylor. Our respect for him and the legacy he has built lays an amazing foundation for what is to come. We are excited by the prospect of getting to know the Timberwolves organization,\" the statement said. Rodriguez was the headliner in a group that tried to purchase the New York Mets last year, before dropping out. Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen bought the club instead. The background on the biggest stages of major sports that Rodriguez has was intriguing to Taylor. \"I just think he understands leadership and what it takes and the different ways that you can coach and motivate people,\" Taylor said, \"and I think having him around will be helpful in the selection of the right leaders for the team.\"", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Former baseball star Alex Rodriguez, partner in agreement to buy NBA's Timberwolves, WNBA's Lynx\" alt=\"Former baseball star Alex Rodriguez, partner in agreement to buy NBA's Timberwolves, WNBA's Lynx\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Alex-Rodriguez-AP-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162821", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Employers start to recognize importance of caregiving benefits", "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "April 7, 2021, 6:09 PM UTC", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "“Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, because we were literally zooming into people’s homes,” said one recruitment expert.", "text": "For millions of Americans, the pandemic triggered an acute caregiving crisis, with working parents leaving their jobs as weeks of remote schooling turned into an entire year. But it has also forced a reckoning in corporate America about the day-to-day demands on working caregivers in general — and working mothers in particular. “Child care and balancing the demands of, say, dealing with a sick kid, have been perennial issues, even pre-Covid,” said Andrew Challenger, vice president at executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The pandemic, Challenger said, essentially pulled back the curtain to expose a rickety, fragmented system that didn’t function very well even at the best of times. When school resumed last fall, 865,000 women dropped out of the workforce between August and September alone, and women’s labor force participation has continued to plummet: As of last month, the labor force participation rate for men older than 19 was 69.5 percent. For the corresponding cohort of women, it was 57.4 percent. What happens next — and how much of the lessons of the pandemic will be retained in the future — could turn out to be an unexpected silver lining during a year of unprecedented stress and challenges. “Sometimes it takes a big crisis to set in motion shifts in compensation,” Challenger said. “This has always been part of the conversation — how do you give flexibility for the worker but still have consistency for the employer? This is something that has been exacerbated during the pandemic,” said Aliya Robinson, senior vice president of retirement and compensation policy for the ERISA Industry Committee, an association focused on benefits at large companies. “With this whole shift to work-from-home, I think a lot of employers realized there's a lot more ability than they anticipated to have employees working from home,” she said. This, in turn, has paved the way for greater acceptance of remote work, scheduling flexibility and more willingness to expand benefits specifically for caregivers — particularly as employers face the prospect of losing valuable talent. “I think it does indicate that this issue, particularly for women around caregiving and careers, has at least been recognized by a large number of organizations. In this crisis, we saw such an outflow of women from the workforce as the coronavirus hit,” Challenger said. “I think you’re starting to see smart companies recognize that if they want to be the best possible company they can be, which means having a diverse set of individuals leading their organization, that it's going to take an active effort to get women back into the pipeline and back into the office.” Research by the Society for Human Resource Management found that women are worried — often rightly so — that dropping out of the workforce can hurt their career advancement: A recent survey found that 27 percent of working women who also act as caregivers said the pandemic had hurt their professional development, compared to just 10 percent of men who said the same. According to surveys of 500 HR managers conducted by Care.com, human resources departments are reevaluating the kinds of benefits they offer employees — and making adjustments to address the yawning gap between caregiving demands and employers’ accommodation of those obligations. More than three in five survey respondents said they plan to increase childcare benefits, while about two in five will expand offerings for elder care. “Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, and that’s because we were literally 'Zooming' into people’s homes,” said Alyssa Johnson, senior director of account management at Care.com. “Employers have literally had a front-row seat into people's homes and lives, and they've seen the challenges families have faced,” she said. “It’s just an acknowledgement of this idea that emergencies happen, emergency child care situations arise. Companies that have now been forced to reckon with a mass child care emergency now have the tools and wherewithal to help employees,” Challenger said. Addressing this is less a matter of altruism than accounting. “Half of HR leaders are seeing productivity decrease in working parents,” Johnson said. “It’s never been clearer — employers are realizing that care challenges have had a significant impact on their workforce, and there is just a real connection between child care and employee performance.” In addition to diminished productivity, employee departures extract a tangible financial toll on employers. “They may actually lose a significant portion of their workforce. That can affect the bottom line,” said Amber Clayton, director of the Society for Human Resource Management Knowledge Center. The opportunity cost of having to devote resources to recruit, hire and train replacements when women leave the workforce can be steep: Pre-pandemic research from SHRM suggested that replacing a salaried employee can cost between six and nine months of that worker’s annual pay. “Hiring and re-hiring is really expensive. Companies are always looking to decrease turnover. There's a real recognition that this is an issue that needs to be addressed,” Challenger said. HR experts report that employers are experimenting with different tools and approaches to ease the burden of caregivers trying to juggle work and family obligations. In addition to greater acceptance of remote work and nontraditional work hours — including longer breaks so parents can supervise kids’ remote lessons — some have expanded paid or unpaid leave, provided subsidies for on-site or in-home child care, or offered on-site child care for employees who can’t work from home. “Employers have stepped up and are making those accommodations,” Clayton said. In a recent survey of more than 200 HR executives, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 84 percent said they are offering workers more flexibility, with many making changes specifically in response to workers’ caregiving obligations. Two out of five reported that they specifically have extended greater flexibility to parents, with 23 percent expanding paid time off and 13 percent offering child care options. Of those, the vast majority — 95 percent — said they plan to make some or all of these changes permanent. “I think it was very eye-opening for employers,” Clayton said. “It forced them to look at their policies and procedures overall.” This is a paradigm shift, experts say, that is long overdue. “It highlighted the need for employers to step in and play a role,” Johnson said. “When families are forced to choose between families and work, no one wins.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3462714/210407-working-childcare-mn-1040_67b30ef91687ca8364dadee5fa16d84c.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"young woman working at home while holding her newborn baby son\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2499\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162827", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "43132", "source": "scrapy"},

Anyway, you don't make a show or a film to 'represent' someone. You just tell stories of people best suited to them. That's what our belief is. That's how storytelling works.

The supernatural thriller elements work really well for   because it's a different story, different era. Very different.   was a story of today. It was set in contemporary Kolkata whereas   is from the late 1800s, early 1900s. Right from the architecture, design, colours, they both present very different visuals. Both the films required different research in terms of the visual aspects.

It was a story which Anushka really liked, and there were considerations of whether she should do it. But I think it's a very similar genre, and she'd already signed and committed to  . Having said that, our endeavour was, or rather is, never to make films for Anushka. She's acknowledged it herself that Clean Slate Filmz isn't a vehicle to showcase Anushka Sharma's acting talents. It's a company to showcase the newer talents which are out there and want to say different. Once we moved ahead on   we cast actors on merit. There was a thorough audition process (by Abhishek Banerjee and Anmol Ahuja's Casting Bay), and the actors you see in the film are the ones who nailed their audition process. Anvita is a celebrated lyricist and a writer of great repute ( ). There was no need for me or Anushka to gain confidence in Anvita. I think she'd have to gain confidence in us to take her story forward. Haha! Right from the time we came across the story to now, what has stayed very clear in our head is Anvita's vision. You could see that the visual language was embedded in the writing. She's delivered on that front. It was a very easy choice because she knew every beat of the story, whether it's the shot breakdown, colour palette or even the propping. We just have to make sure we get her a team that understands her vision, and probably take it forward from what she could've imagined. We're very fortunate to have Meenal (Agarwal, production designer), Veera (Kapur Ee, costume designer), Siddharth Dhiwan (director of photography), and Harry (Hingorani) from Red Chillies (visual effects supervisor). As far as I'm concerned, there's no difference as such. Every projects demands its own mounting for the story. We don't perceive films on the basis of the platform. For  , it was a story that we liked because it was very engaging. It required a certain aesthetic and mounting. Post that was a process of engaging with the studios to see who would understand the requirements of this film. We were extremely fortunate that Netflix realised the potential of the film, and gave us a free hand. I don't feel we would've done anything different that wouldn't have been done if it was a theatrical. I hope there isn't any such criticism coming our way, and it's seen in the light of the story. Anything shouldn't be commented on in isolation. It's very important for filmmakers to be sensible and sensitive towards these matters. As long as it's portrayal, and not indulgence, and done in an aesthetic manner without titillating, I don't see any issue. It has to be shown in totality, along with the payoff as well.

He had just come off a break in   (along with Sudip Sharma in   followed by Anshai Lal in  , and Prosit Roy in  ). We were always fortunate to meet people who matched our sensibility. They were all ready to take the leap and make their first film then. Our philosophy to tell fresh stories is probably what attracts new filmmakers. Anushka doesn't lack anything in the world. What I fall short in are patience and temper. But I'm trying to work on it. We don't! As the name suggests, we believe in starting every project with a clean slate, and don't carry the prejudice from any previous project. We aren't really looking at what people are expecting of us. We're not trying consciously to be different from what we are. We're just trying to find people who have a story to tell that's absolutely theirs. That's what we want from our cinema.

Ketchup has always been a staple condiment for Americans, but since the pandemic forced many restaurants to ramp up their takeout game, the demand for those handy individual packets quickly skyrocketed. And the rules of supply and demand have led to a 13 percent increase in ketchup packet prices since 2020, according to the newspaper. Fast-food chains have always handed out these disposable packets, but sit-down restaurants have traditionally placed bottles of ketchup on tables or poured it out into a bowl for customers. With both food service models now competing for packets, or sachets, as industry experts call them, the supply chain has been stretched to its limit. Kraft Heinz is, of course, the most well-known ketchup manufacturer, and the company makes up nearly 70 percent of the U.S. retail market for ketchup, The Wall Street Journal reported. With more people eating at home, ketchup bottle sales have also increased 15 percent in the last year, to over $1 billion in 2020. As a result of the supply chain shortage, many restaurants are limiting the number of packets they give to customers or resorting to purchasing generic ketchup brands they normally don't use. Some popular fast-food chains like Long John Silver's and   have even had to reach out to secondary suppliers for the packets. Steve Cornell, Kraft Heinz’s president of Enhancers, Specialty and Away from Home Business Unit, told  the company is working hard to keep up the demand for those coveted ketchup packets as the takeout industry continues to explode. “The unmatched consumer love for our iconic HEINZ brand as well as our longstanding partnership with the restaurant industry are two responsibilities we take very seriously – which was why we made strategic manufacturing investments at the start of the pandemic to keep up with the surge in demand for ketchup packets driven by the accelerated delivery and take-out trends,\" he wrote in an email statement. Cornell also noted that Kraft Heinz has been looking into new packaging options to help evolve with its industry. \"At the same time, we also fast-tracked future-focused culinary and packaging innovations, as well as further manufacturing expansion plans, as we believe there is an enormous opportunity to grow our brands in the exciting foodservice industry,” he said. Fans of the 150-year-old ketchup brand will recall that Kraft Heinz invented a single-serve ketchup tray called the   in 2011. In November 2020, the brand also launched a   to help offer restaurants a sanitary way to allow customers to dispense their own condiments. Looking ahead to the future, Cornell said the company is banking on its multiple new production lines, which he hopes will yield a 25 percent increase in production, amounting to 12 billion ketchup packets a year. Ketchup packets are simply the latest shortage in the wake of the pandemic.

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday.   In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11.

They are all worried that the villages would be submerged in June or July because of cyclones and floods. They appealed to the Union and state governments to provide a relief and resettlement package to them, before the completion of Polavaram Project. According to them, nearly 3.5 lakh people, from Schedule Tribe and Scheduled Caste, are facing a threat of their livelihood. According to sources, the government completed 70 per cent of Polavaram project works by the end of December but only four percent of the R & R package was implemented. The Chief Minister aimed at completing the project by the year-end.   As per the 2017 statistics, 5,08,874 persons have been displaced and the number may increase. The state government had announced that 371 villages will be submerged due to the project and CCLA has given permission for providing R&R package to 164 villages. However, only 15 villages have been given partial R&R packages. \r\nIndian Association of Lawyers state executive member Inapurapu Suryanaryana said that the Comptroller and Audit General (CAG) found fault with the project as there is no MoU between Centre and the state government on construction of Polavaram project and advised the state government to reach a truce with the Union Government for the sake of the project.   To avoid submergence problems, the Centre advised state governments of Odisha and Chhattisgarh to construct protection walls at eight and four places, respectively. But, either has obliged. He said that the Union Government has also not taken any steps to have cases filed in the Supreme Court to be withdrawn by Odisha and Chhattisgarh.

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye.

Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162832", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16252", "source": "scrapy"},

Ahead of the April 14-16 observation of the Cambodian New Year, or Choul Chnam Thmey, Hun Sen thanked King Norodom Sihamoni, the armed forces, civil servants, and the people of Cambodia for their support. He pledged to work on improving all aspects of the country, while ensuring peace, maintaining national integrity, protecting Cambodia’s territory, and preventing any interference in the nation’s internal affairs. “The government is strongly taking action against any color revolution attempts or incitement against the constitution and democratic principles that contribute to instability, including political and social chaos,” he said. “As a result, Cambodia has maintained its security, independence, national integrity, and territory, and avoided any unwarranted disaster.” Cambodia’s Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP in November 2017 and barred its members from taking part in political activities, two months after the arrest of party president Kem Sokha for his role in an alleged scheme to topple Hun Sen’s government. The ban, along with a wider crackdown on NGOs and the independent media, paved the way for Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in the country’s 2018 general election. Since then, dozens of CNRP officials and supporters have either fled abroad or been rounded up by authorities for “incitement” after expressing views critical of Hun Sen’s rule. The world’s longest-serving prime minister at 36 years, Hun Sen and his party stand virtually unopposed ahead of commune elections next year and general elections set for July 2023. Speaking to RFA’s Khmer Service on Thursday, Klaing Bunlay, the CNRP’s chief in Bangkok, Thailand, said that Hun Sen’s message is “meant to split Cambodian unity” because he is “afraid of the CNRP’s continued existence and influence.” He said that the opposition party continues to draw support because the people of Cambodia “want social justice.” “Hun Sen’s message does not come from the heart,” he said. “Hun Sen has ignored the needs of the people and persecuted them, actions which have caused pain.” Soeung Sengkaruna, spokesman for Cambodian rights group Adhoc, said that opposition and ruling party leaders should take the opportunity during Choul Chnam Thmey to exchange best wishes and work to resolve the country’s political stalemate. He said Hun Sen’s message could create more pressure, negatively impacting the people, economy, and the country’s development. “We don’t want to see any harm to Cambodia. We want to see a proper democracy, consisting of a power challenge through mutual understanding,” he said. “The winner should win with dignity and the loser should accept the results so that people can exercise their rights according to the constitution and the state can guarantee those rights.” Political analyst Kim Sok told RFA that Hun Sen’s message was also aimed at calming down a public that has endured difficult living conditions amid an economic downturn fueled by the country’s latest and deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus. He said that Choul Chnam Thmey is a time for Hun Sen to deliver a message of national reconciliation for the sake of people so that the country can work on restoring the economy when the pandemic ends. Cambodia, which had largely remained unscathed by the coronavirus in 2020, registered its first death from COVID-19—the disease caused by the virus—last month, a year to the day that that the World Health Organization labeled it a pandemic. Since then, 24 people have died, and Cambodia’s caseload has reached more than 3,000 people. Hun Sen’s address came as London-based rights group Amnesty International issued a scathing assessment of his governance in an annual report, highlighting an intensification in 2020 of what it called “extreme restrictions on civil and political rights implemented since 2017.” The group called out a controversial State of Emergency Law, enacted under the pretext of fighting the spread of the coronavirus, which it said, “severely impinges upon human rights.” Also in 2020, human rights defenders, peaceful demonstrators, and members of the CNRP continued to face harassment and intimidation through a justice system beholden to the government, while women’s rights came under “sustained attack” after Hun Sen led a campaign to punish those who did not adhere to an arbitrary interpretation of “tradition” and “culture.” “Members of the banned CNRP faced continued arbitrary criminalization and increasing levels of physical violence,” the group said. “Judicial harassment against former CNRP politicians and activists intensified in November as at least 126 CNRP-affiliated individuals were summoned in a series of politically-motivated mass trials on treason and incitement-related charges.” Amnesty noted that several CNRP officials and activists were the targets of severe physical assaults, and that authorities had failed to arrest or investigate anyone for the attacks. The group also slammed the country’s Law on Associations and NGOs (LANGO), which it said continued to be used to stifle freedom of association, as well as the arbitrary detention and physical assaults of environmental activists working to expose illegal logging by state authorities and corporate actors.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162808", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12555", "source": "scrapy"},

The overt campiness and winking theatricality of Schumacher’s   and   have long been a point of polarisation among fans of comic book movies, particularly as a darker aesthetic, first established by Tim Burton, and then cemented on movie screens by Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder, has come to define the character. But Schumacher’s approach may well have saved the franchise. (And then, two years later, nearly sunk it.) Schumacher seemed, to some, like an unlikely candidate to take the Bat-baton (Baton?) from Burton. But throughout his career, there was rarely a specific idea of a “Joel Schumacher film”; he was closer to the filmmakers of the classic studio system, a journeyman who could take on just about any assignment he was tossed, deliver it on time and on budget, and generate a profit. So he dabbled in rowdy comedy ( ), touchy-feely dramedy ( ), romantic comedy ( ), horror ( ), and sci-fi ( ). Warner Bros handed him   based on the success of his adaptation of John Grisham’s legal thriller  . It is easy to forget how necessary that hand-off was deemed at the time. Though  , Burton’s 1992 sequel to the record-breaking 1989  , was a commercial success, its grosses fell far short of its predecessor’s. And while critical reaction was mostly positive, some complained about its gloomy tone (Roger Ebert called it “odd and sad”). Plenty of parents agreed, put off by both the dark violence and the subtle, leather-heavy kinkiness of the relationship between Batman and Catwoman. The studio partnered with McDonald’s on Happy Meal tie-in for the PG-13-rated film but no one at the fast-food giant had even seen the film when it devised the campaign. A McDonald’s spokesman later told   that the promotion “wasn’t intended to encourage young kids to see the movie.” In a July 1992 report in   on the relative disappointment of  , Steve Daly whispered, “Word is they intend to make sure that   and its progeny showcase a much less dark Dark Knight — a kind of ‘Batman Lite’ — possibly without Burton at the helm.” That is exactly what happened, and that is exactly what they got. , on the other hand, opened its arms to that influence. The screenplay — credited to Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler, and Akiva Goldsman — is gleefully goofy, filled with corny one-liners and leering double entendres. Schumacher and his cinematographer, Stephen Goldblatt (nominated for an Oscar, one of the three nominations the film received), cram their Dutch-angled frames with candy-coated colors, neon lights, and billowing dry ice, while Elliot Goldenthal’s musical score takes the orchestral pomposity of Danny Elfman’s earlier   themes, and cranks it up to 11. The performers similarly go for the gusto: Jim Carrey is at his most unhinged (no small achievement), Tommy Lee Jones chews scenery like it is his first meal in weeks, and Nicole Kidman vamps it up like the daughter Marlene Dietrich did not know she had. Reviews were more mixed for   —   critic called it, ironically enough, “the empty-calorie equivalent of a Happy Meal” — but audiences were ecstatic. It out-grossed   both domestically and internationally. Warner Bros quickly signed Schumacher for another instalment. Alas, he fell into something of the same trap as Burton; taxed with reprising a mega-success, he leaned so far into his stylistic flourishes that he alienated a mass audience.   has acquired a reputation as one of the worst blockbusters of all time, and it is not entirely unearned. Sloppy, overcooked, and painfully unfunny, it feels like exactly what it was: a filmed deal. That failure caused a bit of retroactive conflation of the two Schumacher pictures, which is unfortunate.   may not have proven a bellwether of big-screen superhero entertainment, though a dose of self-aware silliness would not hurt the Very Serious Filmmakers at both Marvel and DC one bit. But it may be the most succinct encapsulation of the Schumacher style: a big and gaudy, colourful and stylish, cheerfully unapologetic crowd-pleaser.", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Joel Schumacher rescued Batman from Tim Burton's grimness with his signature campiness, winking theatricality\" alt=\"Joel Schumacher rescued Batman from Tim Burton's grimness with his signature campiness, winking theatricality\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/batman-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162832", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "41608", "source": "scrapy"},

But there, among cathedral spires and castle parapets, the animation studio   has carved out a factory of hand-drawn artistry and local folklore that has persisted and flourished well beyond its creators’ expectations. When Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, directors of the enchanting Oscar-nominee  , met growing up in Kilkenny — or even after they finished college and were setting out as animators — any success seemed sure to be found in typical entertainment epicenters like London, New York or Los Angeles. Instead, they decided to stay in Kilkenny with the mission of making a single film. (It turned out to be 2009’s Oscar-nominated  .) Their beginning staff of 12 worked out of an old orphanage. Twelve years later, there are nearly 400 working for Cartoon Saloon and their sister studio, Lighthouse Studios, in the heart of Kilkenny. The Lighthouse offices are housed in the secondary school Moore and Stewart once attended — a very sports-centric school, the directors recall. “Our teenage selves would be glowing with pride,” Stewart says. “Revenge of the nerds, I’ve always said,” adds Moore. Formed when much of the animation world was following Pixar into computer generated animation, Cartoon Saloon is an underdog no more.  , their most ambitious film — one that completes Moore’s trilogy of Irish folklore begun with   and continued with 2014′s   — is expected to give Pixar’s   a run for its money at the Academy Awards later this month.   marks the studio’s fifth Oscar nod. The independent studio now has some very deep-pocketed backers in Apple, which released   along with theatrical distributor GKIDS. Cartoon Saloon’s next film, an adaptation of   by Cartoon Saloon co-founder Nora Twomey, is for Netflix. Founded in 1999 by Moore, Twomey and producer Paul Young, Cartoon Saloon has arrived at these heights by doing everything they weren’t supposed to — making uncompromising, authentically Irish, hand-drawn animation in Moore and Stewart’s hometown. No one is more surprised than they are about how it’s all turned out. “People just told us we were mad,” says Moore, chuckling. “Once you put down even the tiniest little root in a place, it’s very hard to move,” says Stewart. “There was talk along the way to have an LA studio or even a Dublin office. Instead, it just grew and grew and grew.”  is a fitting pinnacle for Cartoon Saloon because it’s set right in Kilkenny. The film, streaming on Apple TV+ and recently brought back into theatres, is about Robyn, the daughter of a British soldier in 17th-century Ireland, who comes upon a “wolfwalker” — a human who can take the form of a wolf. That, naturally, comes from mythology, but the historical backdrop of   is true; this is the time of  . Set between the woodcut-styled drawings of the British-controlled castle and incredibly lush, swirling forests,   is — like Cartoon Saloon, itself — a tale of reclamation. “I definitely felt these three movies that I directed and co-directed were about speaking back to the next generation stuff that I was afraid was going to be completely lost,” Moore says by Zoom from Kilkenny, alongside Stewart. “I had grown up being completely immersed in Batman comics and Japanese and American cartoons and didn’t realise this was all around me.” Often, their surroundings play directly into the films. On a recent day, a stroll in Kilkenny’s Millennium Forest — planted 20 years ago with native trees — had Moore, contemplating the layers of sediment and history beneath him, musing about a possible   spinoff. Increasingly, they’re finding a flock of animators from across Europe eager to follow in their footsteps, as Ireland’s answer to  . For  , Moore showed the storyboard artists the intensely period-appropriate horror film   for inspiration. One artist got so into capturing the era that she drew constellations as they were in the 1650 sky. “When people come here, they’re taking a risk,” says Young. “They’re coming to live in your small town. You better have work for the when they get here.” With a now teeming staff, the earlier, scrappier days of Cartoon Saloon are still vivid to the founders. When their first Oscar nomination was announced, for  , they were in a meeting working out how to stay financial afloat for the next two months. “We survived, but it was tough times,” recalls Young. “At the early stage, the mistake we made was thinking: If we’ve got money, we’re hiring artists. I think what we needed was a few more account-types.” Twomey, who directed the studio’s Afghanistan-set 2017 feature  , disagrees. “But if we did, they would have definitely told us that there’s no money in independent film. It doesn’t make any sense. You should try to be like the big studios. And we would have lost all our freedom,” she says. “I’m glad our hearts were in the right place, and our hands were in the right place.” Stewart, art director on  , a concept artist for   and a painter, always believed hand-drawn animation had more potential. Unlike digital technology, it doesn’t age. In  , you can often see pencil lines have deliberately been left in. Moore wanted to be even more experimental on  , playing with aspect ratios and perspectives. “We kind of decided we didn’t want to do more after this. We wanted to take a break and reflect. Definitely for me, anyway,” he says. “So I said, ‘Let’s try everything that we said we were going to do and either couldn’t afford to do, didn’t know how to pull it off or were wary of.’ And I don’t think we even scratched the surface. There’s still so much more.” Stewart, a nature lover, had planned this year to reach the top of every peak in Ireland. Then came a lockdown that has since December limited everyone to within five kilometres of their home. But Cartoon Saloon has still travelled around the world like never before. There’s even a billboard for   on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. “We’ve never had that kind of attention before. I’d just love to have been there to take a picture of Tomm in front of one of those big billboards,” says Twomey. “I don’t think things will be the same for us after  .” It’s a dramatic change from six years ago, when Moore remembers going into a cinema in Galway and seeing posters of   papered across the walls, with one of   tucked away.

Ted Kennedy's notorious car ride on Chappaquiddick Island. Anne Beatts. “She was witty, and she was good at editing. It was a good team,” Shuster said of Beatts, who died Wednesday at age 74. Unlike Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner and other cast members Beatts and Shuster wrote for, Beatts wasn't widely known to the public and could be reached in her final years simply by emailing her at Chapman University, where she taught comedy writing. But among her peers, and generations of writers and performers who followed, she was a pioneer, a force, and an easy rebuttal to the undying prejudice that women can't be funny. From 1975-80, Beatts and Shuster worked on such recurring sketches as the creepy babysitter Uncle Roy (played by Buck Henry) and Aykroyd's equally perverse Fred Garvin. But their most lasting creation was the Nerds — snivelly Lisa Loopner (Radner) and snotty Todd DiLaMuca (Bill Murray). The Nerds were an act, and a kind of diary. Shuster and Beatts, who later created the groundbreaking teen sitcom  , both identified as nerds and their writing often played against the real-life, ever-changing romance between Radner and Murray. “The dynamic between Billy and Gilda was fabulous,” Shuster told   during a phone interview following Beatts' death. The writing process itself was exhausting, hilarious and sometimes infuriating. Female comedy writers were rare at the time, and getting their ideas even listened to left their heads scarred “from bashing them against the glass ceiling,” Shuster said. John Belushi, who was otherwise friendly with Beatts and Shuster, was so resistant to material written by women that Shuster deliberately left her name off a sketch she wrote with James Downey to ensure the actor would work in it. “It was hard getting writing from a female point of view accepted,” Shuster said. If the glass ceiling didn't quite break in the 1970s, Beatts threw some big rocks. Shuster remembers one of their first meetings with Michaels, Shuster's husband at the time, when Beatts insisted they be paid as much as the male writers. Another time, Shuster and Beatts were at a restaurant coming up with ideas for the show when a man came by and started hitting on Shuster. Beatts picked up her drink and threw it in the man's face. “She had a lot of courage,” Shuster said. “She got out there and fought for what she believed in, and that was great for me. She could really pitch an idea at a meeting. There was a definiteness about her that made you think you needed to make a mark.” Beatts and Shuster remained in touch over the decades following their time with   and had been speaking recently about getting together after being kept apart for a year by the pandemic. Shuster said she didn't know of any health issues that would have led to her friend's death, the cause of which was still unknown as of Saturday, but that she remembers Beatts sounding different the last time they spoke. “She could be spiky. She could be thorny. Her wit, sometimes it stung,” Shuster said. “But she sounded uncharacteristically gentle and loving, and had none of the edge. This was a softer, gentler Beatts.” Thinking of their partnership from the '70s, she added: \"That was a golden period. It was quite a bond. “We made each other laugh.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Remembering Anne Beatts: Fellow Saturday Night Live writer Rosie Shuster recalls colleague's wit, courage\" alt=\"Remembering Anne Beatts: Fellow Saturday Night Live writer Rosie Shuster recalls colleague's wit, courage\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AnneBeatts-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162834", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "40756", "source": "scrapy"},

The initiative is called NinetyToZero, so named for the roughly 90 percent wealth gap between white and Black Americans. Its leaders describe the goal as providing a roadmap for organizations to “counteract centuries of discrimination, segregation, and financial exploitation,” according to the group’s launch plans announced Tuesday. “Every business has a responsibility — and can influence others — to advance racial equity, create opportunities for others and strengthen the communities it serves,” Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ CEO, said in a statement. “Starbucks believes in using our scale for good, and we will address the systemic barriers which keep Americans from reaching their full potential.” Organizations that join NinetyToZero agree to establish internal goals for hiring and promoting Black talent. They also pledge to calculate how much money is spent with Black-owned businesses and in Black-owned financial institutions. “Racial wealth inequity is a threat to child well-being and America’s future,” the Rev. Dr. Starsky Wilson, CEO of the Children’s Defense Fund, another inaugural member, said in a statement. “Institutions committed to the promise of Black children and families must push beyond public statements to concrete action to close the wealth gap.” According to the most recent Federal Reserve statistics available, white families have an average of $171,000 in net worth — including savings, investments and home ownership. For Black families, it’s $17,600. Economists say that closing the racial wealth gap would significantly benefit the nation as a whole. According to a McKinsey & Company report, wealth equity could raise U.S. GDP by $1.5 trillion within 10 years. “The key to narrowing the racial health gap is to narrow the racial wealth gap,” Michelle Williams, Dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which also joined the initiative, said in a statement. “The two go hand in hand, and we will all be the beneficiaries of a more equitable and just society.” Other companies are also working on the issue. United Airlines   that it will open its own flight academy to train 5,000 new pilots this decade, with plans for half of them to be women or people of color to increase diversity at the airline. The foundation Robin Hood, also a member, will incubate the initiative, which will accept other member organizations beyond the 10 inaugural groups announced Tuesday. Further research for new practices that can be used to reduce the racial wealth gap will come from another initiative member, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Also part of NinetyToZero’s inaugural class of organizations: The ACLU, Lord Abbett, McKinsey & Co., and SKDKnickerbocker. “Closing the racial wealth gap is more than a zero-sum game,” Robin Hood CEO Wes Moore said in a statement. “When Black families have economic security and agency, everyone benefits. Now is the time to be reflective, bold and transparent.

The southeast Asian nation may still have weapons at a \"historic\" facility where mustard gas was produced, a senior State Department official told the annual meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Myanmar officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which bans the production, storage and use of chemical arms, in 2015. \"The US has serious concerns that a chemical weapons stockpile may remain at Myanmar's historical chemical weapons facility,\" Thomas DiNanno, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, told the OPCW in The Hague. Washington had information that Myanmar \"had a chemical weapons programme in the 1980s that included a sulphur mustard development programme and chemical weapons production facility\", he added. \"Based on available information, the United States certifies that Myanmar is in non-compliance with the CWC, due to its failure to declare its past chemical weapons programme and to destroy its chemical weapons facility.\" Myanmar has previously faced accusations of storing and using such weapons. In 2013, a parliamentary report said police had used phosphorus the previous year against protesters at a copper mine in the north of the country, causing severe burns. In July 2014, five journalists from Myanmar were sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labour over an article accusing the military of producing chemical arms. The previous year, Myanmar's then quasi-civilian government denied using chemical weapons against rebels from the Kachin ethnic minority during clashes in the north of the country. The US official said Washington had held talks with Myanmar's civilian government and military over the issue and \"stands ready to assist Myanmar\" to destroy the weapons. Myanmar was the 191st State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which came into force in 1997 and is monitored by the OPCW for compliance. In 2005, London-based rights group Christian Solidarity Worldwide accused the former military junta of using chemical weapons against rebels from the Karen community. The US allegation comes as Myanmar faces growing international legal pressure over its treatment of another minority -- the Muslim Rohingya, thousands of whom were forced to flee to Bangladesh in a huge military operation in 2017.

The record-buying could also help India, the world's biggest producer of sugar, to cut stockpiles that are squeezing domestic prices. India had been the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil for five years, but purchases ground to a halt after the January curbs, a retaliation for then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad's criticism of New Delhi's policy regarding its Muslim minority. \"This year Malaysia was aggressively buying Indian raw sugar, which was a pleasant surprise,\" Praful Vithalani, president of the All India Sugar Trade Association (AISTA), told Reuters. The trade body's data shows Malaysia has imported 324,405 tonnes of sugar from India this year. That compares with India's exports last year of around 110,000 tonnes and a 2008 record of 313,406 tonnes, according to trade estimates. Malaysia imported a total of 1.95 million tonnes of raw sugar in 2019, data from the International Sugar Organization on Refinitiv Eikon shows. It typically buys more from Brazil and Thailand than from India. Kuala Lumpur's sugar purchases from India could easily surpass 400,000 tonnes in 2020, as some shipments are still in the pipeline, said a Mumbai-based dealer of a global trading house. Kuala Lumpur may have asked refiners to give preference to India in sugar purchases, said another Mumbai-based dealer, adding, \"It's an effort to please India.\" Both dealers sought anonymity as they were not allowed to speak with media. In January, MSM Malaysia Holdings Berhad, the southeast Asian nation's top sugar refiner, said it would buy 130,000 tonnes of raw sugar from India, worth 200 million ringgit ($49.20 million), in the first quarter. Malaysia has set itself a month's deadline to resolve the dispute over palm oil, its new Commodities Minister Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali said on Wednesday, adding that he wanted to send a delegation to India as soon as possible. \"Malaysia can show that it is buying more goods from India than Indonesia,\" a Mumbai-based refiner said, adding that higher imports of farm commodities would give Malaysia grounds to argue in negotiations that New Delhi should resume palm oil purchases. Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of palm oil, followed by Malaysia.

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release.

We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry.

Employers start to recognize importance of caregiving benefits", "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "April 7, 2021, 6:09 PM UTC", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "“Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, because we were literally zooming into people’s homes,” said one recruitment expert.", "text": "For millions of Americans, the pandemic triggered an acute caregiving crisis, with working parents leaving their jobs as weeks of remote schooling turned into an entire year. But it has also forced a reckoning in corporate America about the day-to-day demands on working caregivers in general — and working mothers in particular. “Child care and balancing the demands of, say, dealing with a sick kid, have been perennial issues, even pre-Covid,” said Andrew Challenger, vice president at executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The pandemic, Challenger said, essentially pulled back the curtain to expose a rickety, fragmented system that didn’t function very well even at the best of times. When school resumed last fall, 865,000 women dropped out of the workforce between August and September alone, and women’s labor force participation has continued to plummet: As of last month, the labor force participation rate for men older than 19 was 69.5 percent. For the corresponding cohort of women, it was 57.4 percent. What happens next — and how much of the lessons of the pandemic will be retained in the future — could turn out to be an unexpected silver lining during a year of unprecedented stress and challenges. “Sometimes it takes a big crisis to set in motion shifts in compensation,” Challenger said. “This has always been part of the conversation — how do you give flexibility for the worker but still have consistency for the employer? This is something that has been exacerbated during the pandemic,” said Aliya Robinson, senior vice president of retirement and compensation policy for the ERISA Industry Committee, an association focused on benefits at large companies. “With this whole shift to work-from-home, I think a lot of employers realized there's a lot more ability than they anticipated to have employees working from home,” she said. This, in turn, has paved the way for greater acceptance of remote work, scheduling flexibility and more willingness to expand benefits specifically for caregivers — particularly as employers face the prospect of losing valuable talent. “I think it does indicate that this issue, particularly for women around caregiving and careers, has at least been recognized by a large number of organizations. In this crisis, we saw such an outflow of women from the workforce as the coronavirus hit,” Challenger said. “I think you’re starting to see smart companies recognize that if they want to be the best possible company they can be, which means having a diverse set of individuals leading their organization, that it's going to take an active effort to get women back into the pipeline and back into the office.” Research by the Society for Human Resource Management found that women are worried — often rightly so — that dropping out of the workforce can hurt their career advancement: A recent survey found that 27 percent of working women who also act as caregivers said the pandemic had hurt their professional development, compared to just 10 percent of men who said the same. According to surveys of 500 HR managers conducted by Care.com, human resources departments are reevaluating the kinds of benefits they offer employees — and making adjustments to address the yawning gap between caregiving demands and employers’ accommodation of those obligations. More than three in five survey respondents said they plan to increase childcare benefits, while about two in five will expand offerings for elder care. “Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, and that’s because we were literally 'Zooming' into people’s homes,” said Alyssa Johnson, senior director of account management at Care.com. “Employers have literally had a front-row seat into people's homes and lives, and they've seen the challenges families have faced,” she said. “It’s just an acknowledgement of this idea that emergencies happen, emergency child care situations arise. Companies that have now been forced to reckon with a mass child care emergency now have the tools and wherewithal to help employees,” Challenger said. Addressing this is less a matter of altruism than accounting. “Half of HR leaders are seeing productivity decrease in working parents,” Johnson said. “It’s never been clearer — employers are realizing that care challenges have had a significant impact on their workforce, and there is just a real connection between child care and employee performance.” In addition to diminished productivity, employee departures extract a tangible financial toll on employers. “They may actually lose a significant portion of their workforce. That can affect the bottom line,” said Amber Clayton, director of the Society for Human Resource Management Knowledge Center. The opportunity cost of having to devote resources to recruit, hire and train replacements when women leave the workforce can be steep: Pre-pandemic research from SHRM suggested that replacing a salaried employee can cost between six and nine months of that worker’s annual pay. “Hiring and re-hiring is really expensive. Companies are always looking to decrease turnover. There's a real recognition that this is an issue that needs to be addressed,” Challenger said. HR experts report that employers are experimenting with different tools and approaches to ease the burden of caregivers trying to juggle work and family obligations. In addition to greater acceptance of remote work and nontraditional work hours — including longer breaks so parents can supervise kids’ remote lessons — some have expanded paid or unpaid leave, provided subsidies for on-site or in-home child care, or offered on-site child care for employees who can’t work from home. “Employers have stepped up and are making those accommodations,” Clayton said. In a recent survey of more than 200 HR executives, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 84 percent said they are offering workers more flexibility, with many making changes specifically in response to workers’ caregiving obligations. Two out of five reported that they specifically have extended greater flexibility to parents, with 23 percent expanding paid time off and 13 percent offering child care options. Of those, the vast majority — 95 percent — said they plan to make some or all of these changes permanent. “I think it was very eye-opening for employers,” Clayton said. “It forced them to look at their policies and procedures overall.” This is a paradigm shift, experts say, that is long overdue. “It highlighted the need for employers to step in and play a role,” Johnson said. “When families are forced to choose between families and work, no one wins.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3462714/210407-working-childcare-mn-1040_67b30ef91687ca8364dadee5fa16d84c.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"young woman working at home while holding her newborn baby son\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2499\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162836", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "43132", "source": "scrapy"},

These high load states are Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. This was part of the state government’s fresh guidelines issued by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur following a spike in Covid-19 cases across the state. The government has allowed tourists to visit the state as of now, but has also directed hotel owners and tourists to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures (SoPs) issued by the government, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said.

Under the new guidelines, devotees in the state have been allowed to visit temples during the Navratri festival but they will have to perform ‘puja’ and ‘darshan’ by maintaining social distancing and using face masks.  However, organising ‘langars’ or community kitchens and ‘jagran’ have been banned by the government. No overcrowding would be allowed in buses and public transport vehicles, the CM said.

A hand touch specialist, Maninder has 526 raid points in 59 matches at an average of 8.92 points. He has scored 44.44% of Bengal Warriors' raid points since season 5 (396 raid points out of 891 raid points). These stats make him an integral part of Bengal Warriors' offensive department. He will lead their raiding attack in PKL 7 and will undoubtedly be Bengal's go-to-man     Baldev Singh, Maninder Singh, Adarsh, Ravindra Kumawat, Sahil, Mohammad Nabibakhsh, K Prapanjan, Jeeva Kumar, Rinku Narwal, Sukesh Hedgde, Amit Kumar, Rakesh Narwal, Mohammad Taghi, Amir, AR Avinash, Vijin Thangadurai, Bhuvneshwar, Viraj Vishnu Landge, Dharmendra Singh     Amit Narwal, Sachin Kumar, Nitesh Kumar, Aashish Nagar, Azad Singh, Arkam Shaikh, Monu Goyat, Shrikant Jadhav, Rishank, Mohsen, Narender, Masud Karim, Surender Singh, Gulveer Singh, Gurdeep, Ankush - July 24, Wednesday  - 7:30 PM  - Gachibowli Indoor Stadium, Hyderabad", "image_url": "<img class=\"img asyncImage\" src=\"https://www.seelatest.com/images/background-seelatest.jpg\" data-src=\"https://static.joonsite.com/seelatest/pro-kabaddi-league-match-preview-up-yodha-will-take-on-bengal-warriors-in-their-opening-match.jpg?width=1200\" alt=\"Pro Kabaddi League Match Preview: UP Yodha will take on Bengal Warriors in their opening match\" title=\"Pro Kabaddi League Match Preview: UP Yodha will take on Bengal Warriors in their opening match\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162826", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday.   In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm. Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162836", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18003", "source": "scrapy"},

Rahul Gandhi in a tweet, said, \"In the light of the devastating Corona second wave, conducting #CBSE exams must be reconsidered. All stakeholders must be consulted before making sweeping decisions.\" \"On how many counts does GOI intend to play with the future of India's youth?\" he added. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also written to the education minister to consider the demands of students for cancelling the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams. Vadra said that its 'shocking' that the CBSE has decided to go ahead with exams despite parents expressing fears and 'apprehensions' about assembling at exam centres in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. She said these 'apprehensions' are not 'Unreasonable', so exams should be cancelled. She, in her letter said, \"It will be practically impossible to ensure the safety of students at large and at crowded exam centres. Additionally, given the nature and the spread of the virus, it is not just the students who will be at risk but also their teachers, invigilators and family members who are in contact with them. Aside from this, by forcing the children to sit for these exams during a raging pandemic, the Government and the CBSE board will be held responsible in the event that any of the exam centres prove to be hotspots at which large numbers of children become infected with the disease.\" The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has also appealed to the Centre to take a uniform decision on the board exams of Classes 10 and 12 across the country in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A unilateral decision by any state would lead to students of that state being at a disadvantage in terms of career and opportunities, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said in a letter, dated April 10, addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. \"Your intervention would mean national consensus, instead of a unilateral decision by any particular state,\" Sawant said in his letter. The exams are due in a few days which will put several students and their families, teachers and non-teaching staff at high risk, he said. According to the revised date sheet for CBSE board exams 2021, the Class 10 exams would be held between May 4 and June 7 and those for Class 12 would be held between May 4 and June 15. CBSE officials have said that exam centres across the country have been increased by 40-50 per cent to ensure social distancing among students.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162836", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "35551", "source": "scrapy"},

Some moments and memories are so special that all it takes is a small sensory cue to take one to a different timeline of one's life. This is often captured by the expression 'madeleine de proust' one of the key passages in Marcel Proust book 'In search of lost time' when a particular sight, smell, food, a song, or an experience unexpectedly unlocks a past recollection. For instance, the smell of jasmine flowers reminds me of my grandmother and how fondly she used to place them near her pillow. It's not uncommon when a simple song triggers a plethora of past memories. No wonder when sometimes I miss my mother near me, I try to do or make something exactly the way she does to intentionally create a madeleine moment and then soak myself in the nostalgia and priceless feelings associated with childhood memories. The reverse is also true. There are events or moments of life thinking about which can make one feel awful. It could be related to anything in the past like the unexpected loss of a loved one, changing dynamics of cherished relationships, emotionally taxing incidents or the struggles in the present moment that instantly makes one negative. Sometimes when a negative situation stays for too long, it can leave one overwhelmed in a way that the person seems to be addicted to negativity or develops a habit of ruminating. For instance, acting as a caregiver where hopes are not high, clinging to a toxic relationship or sticking with the wrong job because of one's helpless condition perceived or real. Rumination is continuously getting lost in a thought loop where you eventually end up thinking about that same negative or sad thought or experience. Why is it that we end up remembering what we want to forget? Perhaps negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that even when an individual has made a conscious thought to not pay heed to it, it keeps coming back. One of the reasons people ruminate is owing to the belief that by ruminating they will probably get an insight into their life or problem. However, it doesn't work out because in a state of ruminating the person is focused more on the problems and consequences instead of solutions. The person may perceive it as natural coping mechanism to adapt with the pain, but one has to ponder whether it's helping one solve a problem or just trapping back in an unhealthy thought cycle. Dwelling on negative thoughts and engaging in self-blame has been associated with mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Research by Peter Kinderman professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they had experienced many negative events in their lives. The question is how to intentionally forget things that only serve to disturb us. Can we exercise influence on our memory? Perhaps the easiest way to forget something is not revisiting it in your mind. There are many theories related to the process of motivated forgetting that suggest that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. According to Freud, memories that are likely to induce guilt, embarrassment, shame or anxiety are actively, but unconsciously, pushed out of consciousness as a form of ego defence. Unconscious or repressed memories are exceedingly difficult to retrieve but remain available. People may resort to 'repression' in which they subconsciously push unpleasant thoughts and feelings into their unconscious as an automatic defensive mechanism. Thought 'suppression' is also a  type of motivated forgetting when an individual consciously attempts to stop thinking about a particular thought. Memories are also forgotten through distortion as perGestalt theory of forgetting. This is also called false memory syndrome in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by false memories, recollections that are factually incorrect but yet are strongly believed. Rehearsing negative memories by ruminating over them only serve to strengthen them, so it's important to forget certain things to live life peacefully. Apparently, we may never forget things completely but when we stop thinking about them, it often fades away as we remember fewer facts. If rumination is affecting your personal growth stop and take notice of the circumstances and triggers that lead you to ruminate. Eliminating the trigger may not be possible always but by practicing mindfulness one can consciously try to respond with an element of awareness breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. This may require consistent practice and conscious efforts but it's important to check yourself lest negativity pulls you into a trap again. Finding a distraction like going for a walk, playing a game, calling a friend, watching a movie or getting engaged in any activity that breaks the chain can also be helpful. If constant rumination is disabling you and you are unable to focus your attention on other important things of life, seeking therapy can be beneficial. Otherwise meditating can also reduce rumination because it helps in de cluttering the mind to arrive at an emotionally calm state. Life is fleeting and made up of a collection of moments. Clinging on to negative experiences will only make us miss out on the beauty of 'now'.Next time if your answer to this question 'Do you remember what you want to forget?' carries away your mind to unpleasant memories and events, change the question itself. Ask yourself - 'Do you forget what you want to remember?' Answering it will not only break the thought cycle and distract your mind but transport you to all the beautiful memories and the blessings in the present moment, that perhaps money can't buy but fills the heart with gratitude.

With many unaware that half the population of 107 million had been told to stay home for a month, stranded workers crowded checkpoints on the edges of Manila as vehicles tried to duck suspensions and police impounded taxis that were still running. \"I need to make a living for my family,\" said Albert Santos, 42, the driver of a passenger jeep, adding that he would try to make as much money before being forced to stop. \"I can't stop or they have nothing to eat.\" The Philippines is the first regional nation to take such drastic steps against the virus, which President Rodrigo Duterte described as \"the fight of our lives\", after deeming existing curbs on movement and gatherings insufficient. In just 10 days, virus infections in the Philippines climbed to 142 from three, with 12 deaths. Malaysia will follow suit from Wednesday, closing borders, schools and most businesses, while restricting internal movement, after a daily jump of 125 cases to 553, nearly two-thirds of them linked to a major event at a mosque. Cambodia's infections doubled to 24 on Tuesday and Thailand reported 30 new ones, taking its tally to 177, for a nearly threefold jump in a week. The regional trend casts more doubt on the view that warmer weather might stem the spread. Thailand's cabinet agreed on Tuesday to close schools, cinemas, bars and entertainment centres, and postpone next month's festivities for New Year in the mainly Buddhist nation. Manila's usually busy business areas were almost deserted on the first morning of home quarantine, with only delivery trucks, police patrols and occasional private vehicles on the roads. City workers in protective suits disinfected public areas, security guards sat outside banks and convenience stores and workers trickled home after night shifts at call centres and medical clinics, among the few exemptions to Duterte's curbs. Many shift workers were stranded after transport was suspended. Police pulled over dozens of taxis, with drivers - and many commuters - unaware of the new quarantine measures, announced on Monday afternoon and only clarified late at night. \"I need to work. I don't get paid if I don't show up,\" said Sheila Reyes, 24, as she waited hopefully for a ride to a factory, some of which are allowed to operate. \"If I have to, I'll walk to work.\" The measures widen a lockdown since Friday that brought immigration limits, curfews, closures of schools and malls, bans on gatherings, social distancing, and restrictions on movement for the capital. The Philippines suspended financial markets on Tuesday, the first trading shutdown in a world struggling to rein in the virus. Malaysia postponed a meeting this week of APEC finance officials. Philippine authorities said international airports in Manila and Clark would be closed to citizens, amid an expected exodus of foreigners before the expiry of a 72-hour deadline to leave. Teething troubles from the quarantine were inevitable and stranded people would receive help to get home and stay there, said Jonathan Malaya, an interior ministry official. \"As expected, there still are people uninformed on last night's announcement,\" he said. \"We have some kinks to fix ... it will normalise once people understand that they really need to stay home.\" In Bangkok's Patpong area, famed for racy nightlife and counterfeit handbags, bar owners and workers said they were already suffering from the virus effect, and mandatory closures were probably for the best. \"We have to follow the government's measures,\" said one bar worker, Kornpisit Kutakorn. \"We have to do this for the common interest.\"", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/17/133340-untitled-design61.jpg?itok=LrIVS2p8\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162836", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22788", "source": "scrapy"},

(AP) — Staking his claim to the  , former   is casting his populist policies and attack-dog politics as the key to future GOP success. In a closed-door speech Saturday night to donors at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump also reinforced his commitment to the party, according to prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press. His appearance came as Republican officials are trying to play down an internal feud over Trump’s role in the party, his commitment to GOP fundraising and his plans for 2024. While Trump’s advisers report he will emphasize party unity, he rarely sticks to script. “The key to this triumphant future will be to build on the gains our amazing movement has made over the past four years,” Trump told hundreds of leading Republican donors, according to the prepared remarks. “Under our leadership, we welcomed millions upon millions of new voters into the Republican coalition. We transformed the Republican Party into a party that truly fights for all Americans.” It was the final address of the Republican National Committee’s weekend donor summit in Palm Beach. Most of the RNC’s invitation-only gathering was held at a luxury hotel a few miles away; attendees were bused to Trump’s club for his remarks. While a significant faction of the Republican Party hopes to move past Trump’s divisive leadership, the location of the event suggests that the GOP, at least for now, is not ready to replace Trump as its undisputed leader and chief fundraiser. Despite Saturday’s intended message, Trump’s commitment to the GOP is far from certain. Earlier in the year, he raised the possibility of creating a new political party. Just a month ago, Trump’s political action committee sent letters to the RNC and others asking them to “immediately cease and desist the unauthorized use of President Donald J. Trump’s name, image, and/or likeness in all fundraising, persuasion, and/or issue speech.” GOP officials have repeatedly tried to play down the fundraising tensions and see Trump’s participation as a sign that he is willing to lend his name to the party. At the same time, Trump continues to aggressively accumulate campaign cash to fuel his own political ambitions. Trump has also regularly attacked his Republican critics in recent weeks, especially Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and No. 3 House Republican Liz Cheney.

They also sued to strip her of emergency powers. Their victory, at the hands of conservative justices who at the time were a majority on the state  , forced her to issue public health orders through the state Department of Health and Human Services, which has its own legal authority. That was the context in January, as Michigan’s COVID-19 numbers declined and attention turned to the status of restaurants.  The debate wasn’t about whether to allow diners in restaurants but how many and how soon, according to those emails that reporter   of   obtained. Gordon and his team presented a plan to limit tables to six people from one household and 20 people indoors at one time. Restaurants could also have as many as 100 patrons indoors if they added new ventilation and underwent state inspections.  Whitmer instead issued a plan allowing all restaurants to accommodate up to 25% capacity or 100 customers. It also made ventilation and inspections voluntary. (Her administration has further loosened the restrictions since then.) Once cases started rising, public health experts began urging Whitmer to reintroduce dining restrictions. They have also been lobbying for curbs on high school sports, which epidemiologists have said is another source of spread, although the problem seems to be less the activities themselves than the carpooling and socializing that follow. “I don’t think that this is a moment to be pretending like indoor dining and sports activities are worth the risk to people, especially considering what we’re seeing with B.117,”  , the former public health director for Detroit, told HuffPost. In her press conference announcing the voluntary measures on Friday, Whitmer sounded like somebody who understood and largely agreed with that diagnosis but was wary of pushing too far. “It’s less of a policy problem that we have and more of a compliance and variant issue that we are confronting,” she said. “State policy alone won’t change the tide.” The political resistance Whitmer faces is not difficult to understand. Even as public health experts seek new restrictions, she’s facing calls from Republicans to dial them back. “I am glad the governor encouraged personal responsibility and safety today,”  , the GOP state House speaker, said in a trollish response to Friday’s announcement. “Now let’s take the next logical step. Let’s remove the remaining restrictions in Michigan.” Whitmer is also facing a new lawsuit, this one from a group calling itself  . The organization wants state courts to block mandatory COVID-19 testing of teen athletes, even though robust testing would seem like the surest way to keep student athletes healthy and still playing. (Daily testing of athletes is what has allowed professional leagues like the NBA and NFL to carry on their seasons.)  The compliance issues are real, too. Increasingly large numbers of people are ignoring Michigan’s mask mandate, which health experts say is likely another significant cause of spread. “There is a big contribution of behavior,” Martin said. “I was grocery shopping outside of my usual area this weekend, and less than half of people in the store were wearing masks.” The same thing is happening all over the country, including in other states with rising caseloads. Federal officials such as  , director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have   with Americans to stick with social distancing and masking just a little longer.  Whitmer’s other big ask on Friday was for more vaccines from the federal government, which is something she had been urging for days. And she’s not alone. The two senior members of Michigan’s U.S. House delegation, Democrat Debbie Dingell and Republican Fred Upton, sent the Biden administration a   echoing the request.  The administration has responded by saying it would send more testing supplies and vaccinators to the state, but not more vaccines.  , White House COVID-19 coordinator, on Friday cited fairness and uncertainty over which states might soon be seeing new outbreaks. He also said some of the hard-hit states, presumably including Michigan, have surplus supply they could be distributing.  (Independently figuring out how much vaccine states have, and whether they could meaningfully increase administration, remains difficult because of reporting lags and discrepancies between federal and state websites.) “Yes, we need a vaccine surge,”  , the Flint pediatrician famous for her role in exposing that city’s lead poisoning crisis, tweeted on Thursday. “But it will take a few weeks to confer immunity. Right now we must restrict indoor activity, mask up & socially distance.”  To longtime public health advocates such as El-Sayed, the most frustrating part is that the warming weather should enable outdoor dining and make social distancing a lot easier than it has been for the last five months. With widespread vaccination now underway, tougher restrictions would need to be only short-term. “The reality is that we don’t need to do this for another year,” El-Sayed said. El-Sayed has   making restrictions mandatory but tying them to vaccination rates, in part to give holdouts more reason to get the shots. Whitmer has not talked about anything along those lines. But on Friday, in her call for voluntary action, she made the same essential argument: that the end of the pandemic is really almost here, and a premature return to normality will have deadly consequences. “We can’t let up now, not when we’re so close,” Whitmer said. “That’s the nature of this virus: The second we let our guard down, it comes roaring back.”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162837", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "66190", "source": "scrapy"},

We spoke a few hours before he was executed and some of our last words were spent discussing his last words. For the first time, his optimism was gone. Even the day before, he sounded hopeful because he had heard that the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney  .  Brandon read his speech to the Pardon Office to me before presenting it, and the profound level of remorse he expressed brought me to tears. He was a different person from the teenager arrested over 20 years earlier. Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed. I began writing to death row prisoners after reading Bryan Stevenson’s book   about an innocent man condemned to death row. Books often change my course; I read   a few years ago and haven’t eaten meat since. After reading “Just Mercy,” I sent out postcards to about a dozen death row inmates across the U.S. When I started what my husband, family and friends universally consider an odd hobby, I had no idea how gratifying and life-altering writing death row prisoners would become.   When we first began exchanging letters a year ago, I warned Brandon that I had one other pen pal at Terre Haute federal penitentiary. In my experience, inmates do not want to write someone with multiple pen pals at the same facility out of legitimate concerns over privacy and safety. Brandon’s immediate response was, “Well, then that makes me one of the two luckiest men at Terre Haute.” To call himself lucky after over   23 hours a day in a six-by-eight-foot cell was the first of many lessons in gratitude Brandon taught me. Brandon was 18 when he took part in a robbery gone wrong. He had no prior history of violence. Brandon’s friends carjacked a white couple, Todd and Stacey Bagley, youth ministers innocently offering a ride to kids purportedly in need. Later, Brandon rejoined the group only to see Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the crime, fatally shoot Todd and Stacey in the head at close range. The man who had just shot two people in the head and still had a gun in his hand then ordered Brandon and three other teens to set the car on fire with the couple’s bodies inside.    At trial,  , meaning he offered the jury no alternative perspective on the charges. Brandon was the only accomplice not given an opportunity to plead guilty. The other accomplices pleaded out and received prison sentences; two are home with their families now.  Brandon was falsely portrayed as a hardened high-level gang member. Prosecutors suppressed evidence by their own gang expert that the gang had a 13-tier hierarchy with  . Brandon never got the chance to clarify his case in court — it remained the story poorly told at trial two decades earlier. Five of the nine surviving jurors  , stating that they would not have voted for the death penalty had prosecutors disclosed all facts at trial and had Brandon’s own lawyer competently defended him.   In her dissent written hours before Brandon’s execution, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor   “despite troubling allegations that the Government secured his death sentence by withholding exculpatory evidence and knowingly eliciting false testimony against him. [He] has never had the opportunity to test the merits of those claims in court. Now he never will.” Brandon became the youngest person, based on age when the offense occurred, to be put to death by the federal government in nearly 70 years,  . He was 40 when he died.  Brandon loved his life, even in its limited capacity on death row.   in his decades behind bars. This is no small feat given that death row is like a prison within a prison, with countless oppressive rules and ensuing frustrations.  Brandon mainly spent his time mentoring at-risk youth, reading, crocheting and playing the guitar. Brandon was calmer and more patient than most people I’ve come across; he spoke slowly and thoughtfully and was an avid listener. He never cursed and when I asked if that was for religious reasons, he said, “No, cursing just feels too aggressive to me.” A few days before his execution, Brandon’s family visited him for the last time.  After the visit, Brandon told me there was a hole in the pane of glass. I naively said, “Oh, so you were able to hold hands.” He explained it was an air hole to speak through, not large enough for hands, “But,” he said, “I could smell my mom.” In 20 years, including in his final days, Brandon was never allowed to physically touch a loved one. Never having physical contact is an inhumane daily assault on the soul. Brandon’s case fits the death row profile: His crime and trial took place in Texas, a state that has   of the national total. Brandon’s jury consisted of  . Brandon was Black — despite being 13% of the U.S. population, Blacks   of death row inmates. The victims are white in   of homicide death penalty cases. A recent   found that in executions involving interracial murders since 1976, 295 Black defendants were executed for killing white victims, while only 21 white defendants were executed for killing Black victims. Death row is riddled with racial bias and is disproportionately home to Black men   against a white person. Fairness cannot be achieved. Executions in our country, whether with rope or needle, have always been about race. President Joe Biden has   and to give incentives for states to do the same. There is a simple alternative to government executions: Keep people behind bars without resorting to killing them.   worldwide have abolished the death penalty. Italy abolished the death penalty in 1948;  . In the Netherlands, the last execution took place in 1952; Australia in 1967. Since ending the death penalty in 1976,  . The U.S. is the   to conduct executions. Even Russia stopped executions in 1996. Our country   with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt and Pakistan. We are very late in ending state-sponsored executions. It can be done; last month  . Brandon, with his typical positivity, would say now is the time. Friends sitting on death row for years have taught me many lessons: patience, keeping the conversation real and meaningful, and appreciating what I have.  The hassle of driving my daughter to school is now about holding her hand at stoplights and rolling the windows down so I can feel the air. The freedom. During our daily talks, I never had anything to offer Brandon other than my love and support. He never asked me for a single thing besides friendship. Brandon was religious, but since I’m not, I couldn’t offer him prayers or talk about how heaven is a better place. I could only helplessly listen and tell him that I love him.    were his deep regret to the victims’ families, his love for his own family and, true to his thoughtful nature, he told the prison guards not to let his execution upset them. Our final words to each other were about what he would visualize on the gurney to stay calm. I told him to imagine my arms holding him down instead of straps and he promised he would. I was crying and told him I was sorry I couldn’t save him. He said I saved him with my love.

However, a new research suggests that doctors are still finding it hard to procure personal protection kits even after reaffirmation from authorities over the last few weeks. Very recently, the Royal College of Physicians condemned the lack of preparedness by calling it “truly terrible” while adding that the lives of frontline workers continues to be at risk due to the non-availability of PPE kits. A survey undertaken by the college claims that doctors who undertake AGPs (Aerosol-generating procedures) whereby people are asked to expel droplets from their mouths, over 37 per cent don’t have access to a visor while over 31 per cent don’t have full-length gowns. To be put in the line of direct particles containing COVID-19, a doctor has to wear a head to toe PPE gear. The survey witnessed responses by 2,129 doctors, The Guardian reported. Turns out, over 27 per cent doctors claimed to have no access the kits required to ensure their safety. In the beginning of April, the number was much lower - at 22 per cent. This could in turn disrupt the treatment process, as doctors may refuse to treat patients in the absence of kits. The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly asserted that face masks are solely for healthcare workers, not the general public. However, the Chinese authorities have claimed that masks should be worn by everyone at all times. Many studies have also found that the rate of infection can be lowered by ensuring masks are being worn by both the infected and the non-infected. “Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO said. However, masks are not the straightaway solution, for the frontals of these masks could be infected with the virus and could still infect people when they take it off. Additionally, the world is currently witnessing a shortage of medical grade masks, putting the lives of healthcare workers at risk. \r\n \r\n A separate survey claims that over 61 per cent of family doctors in the UK are now refusing to treat patients in the absence of availability of PPEs. Additionally, 74 per cent claim that they fear for their life and health.

Other airlines had similar policies, including Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines, but they have since gone back to selling all seats. Physically distancing from other passengers is extremely difficult on an airplane. Delta and other carriers have repeatedly said filtration systems and intense cleaning make it unlikely that travelers will catch Covid-19 on a plane. But Delta said many travelers choose Delta over other airlines because it kept its policy in place. CEO Ed Bastian said in announcement that 65% of customers who flew Delta in 2019 said they expect to have at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by May 1 and that that is “giving us the assurance to offer customers the ability to choose any seat on our aircraft, while also introducing new services, products and rewards to support the journey.” The change comes just as what an improved summer travel season approaches.

Fifty-eight Trump administration appointees sought conversion from Jan. 1, 2020, to Jan 20, 2021, according to the Office of Personnel Management documents. Of those, 31 conversions were approved, six were denied, 15 were returned or withdrawn, and six remained pending. During the corresponding period under former President Barack Obama — Jan. 1, 2016 to Jan. 20, 2017 — 46 appointees sought conversion, with 36 approved, six denied and four returned or withdrawn. All but one of the 13 Trump administration political appointees who sought   in the weeks between President Joe Biden’s election and inauguration were not approved, according to the OPM reports obtained by NBC News for the last quarter of 2020 and the first 20 days of January. Five requests were withdrawn or returned and six remained pending and under review by the OPM. By comparison, nine of the 11 Obama administration political appointees who requested approval for conversion to civil service jobs from Election Day 2016 through Trump’s inauguration were approved. At least one of those attempted conversions during that period under Trump was denied by the OPM because the agency said it couldn’t conclude the attempted appointment was free of “political influence,” according to the documents. The OPM tracks such conversion requests on a quarterly basis and subsequently provides the information to members of Congress. NBC News  through the first three quarters of 2020. There is nothing new about Trump’s attempts to embed political appointees into civil service jobs; outgoing presidents have done it for years. (Civil service workers have protections that political appointees do not, and new administrations find it harder to fire them.) The latest disclosures reveal the extent to which Trump’s political appointees sought, in the former president’s final months, weeks and even days in office, to stay on in career government positions — a process some government watchdog groups called   Successful conversions would give Trump a legacy of influence in parts of the federal government that would endure far past his time in the White House. Experts interviewed by NBC News expressed concerns over the numbers and timing of political appointees seeking conversion to permanent jobs after the election in particular, as well as about the number of appointees who had previously applied for and were granted conversions after the election. It is normal for some political appointees who are nearing the end of their time in government to seek stronger job security in permanent positions, as it is for some political appointees who are passionate about the work and who are qualified for relevant permanent jobs, experts said. But they also said that in this case, the large number of conversion applications and the post-election timing, as well as the large number of rejections by the OPM, were unusual. “You can see in the number of non-approvals by OPM that there are a bunch of political appointees [who sought career jobs] that are clearly problematic,” Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, said. “Why are these people only coming into these jobs only after the candidate who wanted them there has lost?” Nick Schwellenbach, a senior investigator at the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight, said: “It’s the kind of thing where people inside the administration know that it’s coming to an end. “Some of these people, either on their own, or at the behest of others, start seeking conversions so they can stick around.\" A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to requests for comment. The latest report obtained by NBC News also provided updates to previously pending conversion requests from the third quarter of 2020. Among those requests, on two occasions, a political appointee’s conversion request was denied because the OPM “could not conclude appointment was free of political influence and complied with merit system principles and applicable civil service laws and regulations.” One denial pertained to an unnamed political appointee inside the White House Counsel’s office who had requested approval for a conversion to be an attorney in an ethics job within the general counsel office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a crucial agency that regulates U.S. derivatives, options and futures markets. The other was a political appointee within a Montana office of the Department of Agriculture who had requested approval for a conversion to another Montana office within the agency. In both cases, the names of the appointees were redacted. Meanwhile, government watchdog groups expressed concerns over two people whose initial conversion requests had since been approved. One such conversion was that of Carl Risch, whose October conversion request to be the deputy director, the No. 2 job, at the Executive Office for Immigration Review within the Department of Justice (a civil service job), was approved in December. Risch had been an assistant secretary for consular affairs at the State Department, a political job. His new job came with a $10,000 raise. His is at least the  , which conducts removal and deportation proceedings in immigration courts across the country. “It’s a red flag when there are multiple people being converted to jobs at a single entity. It really raises an even larger concern,” Stier, of the Partnership for Public Service, said. “The process is supposed to be that a political appointee in no way has a leg up on the competition for a career job, but when you see multiple go to the same agency, you really have to wonder how it can be possible that the best qualified individuals are not once, but multiple times, people who are political appointees.” Risch did not respond to multiple requests for comment. EOIR spokeswoman Kathryn Mattingly said Risch went through the standard pre-hiring review process with the OPM and that the agency had approved his new position. Another conversion that drew attention from Schwellenbach, Stier and other experts was that of Keith Gray, whose July request to become the associate administrator at the Department of Agriculture’s risk management agency office was approved Jan. 17, just three days before Trump left office. Gray had been a chief of staff at the division, which helps determine farming subsidies for certain groups of farmers. His new job came with a $26,000 raise. Stier pointed to   that says a career job opening “cannot be created or tailored solely for the benefit of the current or former political appointee” as a reason that the conversion of Gray, who had held a leadership position in the division, caught his eye. “The fact that he is getting a job inside the division that he was the chief of staff of, I don’t really know how you do that within the confines of the OPM review process,” he said. “I don’t know how you can be assured that it was a free and fair competition when you have someone on the inside throwing their hat in. It strikes me, on its surface, as implausible that it was a free and fair competition.” The nonpartisan government watchdog   raised questions over Gray’s conversion to a career job  Gray did not respond to multiple messages. The Department of Agriculture and its risk management division both declined to comment. Separately, government watchdog groups pointed to apparent ongoing attempts to embed political appointees at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a pivotal agency that regulates the transmission, transportation and sale of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. FERC also reviews proposals to build interstate natural gas and oil pipelines. Half of the pending conversions from the period from Election Day through Trump’s last day in office were for conversions of employees elsewhere in the federal government to civil service jobs at FERC. Two requests, filed Dec. 22 and 23 with the OPM, were for conversions to “attorney advisor” jobs within the agency. A third, filed Jan. 4 with the OPM, was for a trial attorney job inside FERC’s legal department. The names of the people, and their initial political appointment positions, were redacted. E&E News, a widely read energy trade publication owned by Politico, reported in December that FERC had been politicized during the Trump administration. In November, Trump fired the commission’s chairman in a rare move that  was viewed by many as an act of retribution for comments he had made supporting climate action. “Having political people burrow in at an agency like FERC is a huge problem with real consequences,” Stier said. “Just look at what happened in Texas,” he added, referring to the fact that   that its power grid wouldn’t handle a brutal cold snap went unheeded, leaving  . FERC spokeswoman Mary O’Driscoll said in a statement, “It is not unusual for either Republican or Democratic commissioners to hire current or former political appointees from other agencies as advisors” and that “all FERC hiring procedures are done with the oversight and approval of OPM.” Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., as the chair of the House Subcommittee on Government Operations, has pushed for more transparency surrounding the number and identities of conversions to civil service jobs requested during the Trump administration. He said the names and situations identified by NBC News in the latest reports prove how crucial an apolitical civil service is for the government to function successfully — and called for measures that would further examine all, and possibly remove some, of Trump’s conversions from their jobs. “Our country is just now coming out of a pandemic, and continued progress requires a civil service of committed, competent officials. Many of President Trump’s political appointees were openly and unapologetically committed to tearing down the institutions they were tasked to serve and lacked expertise,” he said in a statement. “To allow them to continue in the federal government will hurt all Americans and they must be removed,” he added.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_44/3424219/201029-donald-trump-maga-rally-ac-828p_c93e3f4d695a7d9de6357a085cc195ee.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Donald Trump Campaigns For Re-Election In Michigan\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162837", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "48883", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asianage.com:443", "section": "india", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/090421/maoists-free-cobra-commando-after-5-days-of-captivity.html", "title": null, "author": "RABINDRA NATH CHOUDHURY", "author_link": "/byline/rabindra-nath-choudhury-1", "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Maoists had grilled him to extract information on the strength of the security forces deployed in the region and the weapons they use", "text": " The CRPF’s CoBRA commando Rakeshwar Singh Manhas walked free  on Thursday evening after spending five days in Maoists' custody.

Thriving with the OTTs’ boom has been actress Anupria Goenka, whose performances in web series such as Asur, Aashram 2 and Criminal Justice 2 took everyone by surprise. Criminal Justice, which was a runaway success, even made Anupria a household name while bringing to the fore a hard-hitting reality of present day — marital abuse. The success of the show so compelled Hotstar Specials that it decided to launch another season of the series, titled Criminal Justice: Behind Closed Doors. \r\nWhile reiterating the important issues that the show has addressed, Anupria recollects her experiences on the show. “It was beautiful, especially because it was the first time that I was reprising a role — Nikhat’s,” she tells us. “Criminal Justice: Behind Closed Doors is a very important series and is very close to my heart because of the issues it addresses. It’s about patriarchy across all social strata.” \r\nThe actress also points out how gratified she feels about the many people messaging her, sharing their understanding of the crux of the series. “I have even received messages from women who have gone through the abuse in real life, appreciating our effort to change the society,” she adds. \r\nAnupria, who was seen in films such as War, Padmaavat and Tiger Zinda Hai, believes OTT platforms allow a lot more breathing space. “I believe both the platforms are great on their own, but OTTs allow the character graphs to grow. The shoots are longer, enabling greater team bonding and character elevation,” she points out. \r\nThat’s not to say she doesn’t have fun while shooting films, she interjects. “For instance, while shooting for Tiger Zinda Hai, I had a lot of fun and have some fond memories, having made besties with my co-actors,” she tells us. Then she adds excitedly, “Moreover, it was my first shoot abroad and that too with Salman Khan, someone who has a very interesting aura. Similarly on the sets on War, it was a totally different experience. While it was ‘fun unlimited’ with Tiger Shroff and Hrithik Roshan, we were simultaneously all completely dedicated on the sets.” \r\nBe all that as it may, Anupria still believes that — no matter what the platform — the script has a lot to do with how the actors portray their characters.   \r\nHaving worked with the top names of the industry, including Salman Khan and Hrithik Roshan, Anupria, who has a movie slated to come out this year, feels that as an actor, she still has a lot more to do in terms of content. \r\n“I want to do roles that have a lot of meat in terms of a huge graph of different emotions and characterisations. I want to do comedy, even dark and rural characters as well as period drama,” she elaborates. “For now, I’ve to shoot for Asur 2 and Aashram Season 3, which will also release soon. Then, I have another series about which I am super excited.” \r\nThen while talking to us about her contributions to society through her work, Anupria points out how she deals with trolls on social media. “In the past few years, I’ve voiced my opinion on certain things that mattered to me and, yes, I did face moderate trolling. But I take it as it comes and do not let it get the better of me,” she says simply. “I believe social media is a place to agree to disagree, to give each other space to have a dialogue. Everybody can have an opinion and it’s good to have a discussion. In fact, I believe social media can be a beautiful place to connect with each other.”  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162729", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16980", "source": "scrapy"},

Taking a giant step for diversity, the Biden-Harris Administration seeks to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. On Friday the administration submitted US President Joe Biden's priorities for 2022 discretionary spending to Congress. \"This goal aligns with President Biden's commitment to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all,\" said acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk.  While the first cadre of astronauts for the Artemis program was announced in December, the first two crew members for Artemis III in 2024 have yet to be announced. The initial group of 18 represents a diverse team of astronauts, including those new to NASA and veterans of spaceflight. The Artemis astronauts also include Indian American Raja Chari. \"These are historic moments in advancing equity for all of mankind,\" said Bhavya Lal, acting NASA chief of staff. She added that the announcement is personally \"very meaningful\" to her. Lal came to the US at 18 years old, carrying two suitcases full of books and never imagining she would work at NASA in the future. \"If you can see it, you can believe it,\" she said in a tweet. Returning astronauts to the moon will act as a proving ground before sending them on to Mars, a long-term goal of the Artemis program.  When astronauts explore the lunar south pole, which has never been visited by humans before, they will build on the legacy and science gained during the Apollo program and carry it into a new century.In a statement released by , the proposed spending also calls for an increase of more than 6 percent than the previous year.  \"This USD 24.7 billion funding request demonstrates the Biden Administration's commitment to NASA and its partners who have worked so hard this past year under difficult circumstances and achieved unprecedented success,\" Jurczyk said.  \"The President's discretionary request Strengthens NASA's ability to better understand Earth and how it works as an integrated system, from our oceans to our atmosphere, how it all impacts our daily lives, and how it all is impacted by climate change,\" he added. In addition to aiding the Artemis program and studying climate change, the President's request would also help further the agency's robotic exploration of space, provide a boost to aviation technology and provide new funding for NASA's efforts to engage in STEM outreach for underserved students, according to the agency. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162837", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "33743", "source": "scrapy"},

He was 93. Clark, whose father, Tom Clark, was attorney general and U.S. Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his Manhattan home, a family member, Sharon Welch, announced to media outlets   After serving in President Lyndon Johnson’s Cabinet in 1967 and ’68, Clark set up a private law practice in New York in which he championed civil rights, fought racism and the death penalty, and represented declared foes of the United States including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. “If you don’t insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others?” he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedy’s Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever — Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Truman’s attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty  , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clark’s client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers. There were usually two to three dozen active cases on Clark’s legal calendar, and about 100 more in the background. Capital punishment cases were a staple. “We talk about civil liberties,” he said. “We have the largest prison population per capita on Earth. The world’s greatest jailer is the freest country on Earth?”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162837", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "59035", "source": "scrapy"},

Both incidents took place in Cooch Behar of North Bengal, the BJP’s stronghold. The Election Commission said that the CISF had to fire in order to save lives of voters who came to vote, put in place certain restrictions, including extending the \"silence period\" from 48 hours to 72 hours for the fifth phase of polling West Bengal. It also barred the entry of politicians in Cooch Behar district for the next 72 hours to prevent any possible law and order flare-up.   The shocking incident took place at around 10.30 am when a group of TMC workers stormed a polling booth (No. 126) at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra in Shitalkuchi Assembly constituency. Facing their attack, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) troopers, who were guarding the booth, fired on the mob and shot dead four persons — Hamidul Haque, Monirul Haque, Samiul Mian and Amjad Hossain — while injuring three others.  According to the CISF, the mob of around 150 first manhandled the polling staff at the booth. Sources said they were not “armed”, but some were carrying bamboo sticks. \"The CISF booth commander tried to pacify the miscreants but the mob entered the polling booth and beat up the other polling staff on duty. Few miscreants tried to snatch the weapons of CISF personnel deployed there. As a result, CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air but the mob did not pay any heed to the warning. In the meantime, a quick response team of the CISF and police also reached the spot. The mob further started advancing aggressively towards CISF personnel. Therefore, sensing imminent danger to their life, they fired seven more rounds towards the advancing mob of miscreants. While the above incident was going on, more police parties also arrived at the booth. It is reported that in self-defence they have also fired a few rounds,\" the CISF said.   Polling was stopped immediately by the EC.  The CISF's justification of \"self-defence\" was supported by the district police and administration in its preliminary report to the EC which, issuing the CISF a clean chit later, said, \"Recourse to open fire by CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save lives of voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as mob had attempted to snatch their weapons.\" The TMC, however, described the shooting as “cold-blooded murder\" of its workers in its complaint to Chief Electoral Officer West Bengal Ariz Aftab. Spewing venom against the Central forces and Union home minister Amit Shah, an angry chief minister flew to Siliguri and announced that the Criminal Investigation Department would probe the killings.    The TMC chief is likely to visit the kin of the deceased on Sunday though the EC has banned the entry of any politician of any level in Shitalkuchi.  The tragic incident follows party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee's recent statements that the Central forces were acting in a biased manner at the behest of the BJP and asking voters to gherao them. On Saturday, her party landed in the dock after its workers shot dead a first-time voter, Ananda Burman (18), in the same district. The teenaged boy was standing in a queue outside a polling booth (No. 285) at Pathantuli Shalbari area when a scuffle broke out between TMC and BJP workers. Another person, close to him, also suffered bullet injuries.   Despite the poll-violence, the 44 seats spread across five districts of West Bengal recorded a voters' turnout of 76.16 per cent on average till 5 pm. While Cooch Behar saw 79.73 per cent polling in nine seats, the figure stood at 73.65 per cent in five of Alipurduar seats, 75.49 per cent in 11 seats of South 24 Parganas, 75.03 per cent in nine seats in Howrah and 76.02 per cent in 10 Hooghly seats.  Updated data is expected from the Election Commission on Sunday. Among the 11 seats in South 24 Parganas, five -- Jadavpur, Kasba, Tollygunge, Behala East and Behala West -- are actually located in Kolkata.  The Election Commission’s order said that in Cooch Behar, comprising nine Assembly constituencies where voting got over on Saturday, no political leader from any national, state or other party should be allowed to enter the geographical boundaries of the district for the next 72 hours.   \"The Election Commission of India further directs that the silence period for phase 5 (i.e. for polls scheduled on April 17) shall be extended to 72 hours and no campaigning shall be permitted during 72 hours before the close of the poll in order to ensure the conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections,\" an EC order said. The silence period is generally for 48 hours.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162837", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17996", "source": "scrapy"},

Germany, which has been lauded by critics and analysts alike for tackling the virus head on, has made masks mandatory for everyone. Last week, Germany started relaxing restrictions placed on people. For instance, all shops bigger than 8,600 square feet were allowed to reopen. Additionally, all car dealers and bicycle stores have opened across the country.   However, you could end up paying $5,412 for not wearing a mask in the country. As part of its precautionary measures, Germany has imposed fines between $16 to $5,412 for people who are caught not wearing a mask. Even though some of the country’s 16 states are not imposing any fines, most states that have chosen to impose the fine have varied degrees of fines. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced a slew of measures to ensure relaxations do not lead to a relapse for the country. She has that face coverings should be worn mandatorily across all public spaces. ''It is recommended that masks be used in public transport and while shopping,'' Merkel had announced on April 15. As the lockdown continues to make people eager to step out, Merkel had warned against easing restrictions too quickly.   When reports came out of some big stores reopening, she warned against hurrying into reopening and said, “their implementation worries me. Partially, they appear to be very bold, maybe too bold.\" \r\n \r\nJust like the US, Germany has a decentralised system, no state can be forced to make masks mandatory. Regardless, every state has decided to uphold the rule, even with varying degrees. However, it is not mandatory to wear surgical masks, the basic idea is to cover one’s face. Research suggests how masks, even though only partially effective in protecting people from the virus, can prevent the transmission of virus if worn by infected people. In the state of Berlin, masks are not mandatory, and people may board public transport without covering their faces. However, the hardest hit state of Bavaria has made face covering compulsory, with fines of over $5,412 for store owners who fail to enforce social distancing and face covering norms.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/04/28/138387-untitled-design.jpg?itok=sAtfLO7m\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162837", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22052", "source": "scrapy"},

In the last 24 hours, ninety-four deaths have been recorded in the country, with a total tally of 2,009. On Monday, President Vladimir Putin announced the end of Russia’s non-working period from Tuesday.

He further asserted plans to gradually reopen the economy over the course of the upcoming weeks. Starting Sunday, the rate of infection has been jumping phenomenally in Russia. Now, over 10,000 infections are reported daily. On the other hand, west Europe is now in the process of easing lockdown restrictions.

Pebble has 90 days to reply with a plan to mitigate the damage.   While the letter does not outright block the mine, environmentalists and former officials call it a significant setback for the project that has in recent weeks attracted opposition from prominent Republicans including the President's son, Donald Trump Jr., Vice President Mike Pence's former chief of staff Nick Ayers, and Fox News' Tucker Carlson. The Army Corps said in a statement that the project \"as currently proposed, cannot be permitted\" under the Clean Water Act.  The Army Corps cited a federal code that requires Pebble to restore, enhance or preserve an area comparable to that which would be damaged by the mine. That massive undertaking could potentially delay the project from getting its long-sought permit until after the US election in November, according to three current and former Environmental Protection Agency officials, two of whom did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation.

In yet another major development in the rape case against ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath, the victim has written to Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Police Commissioner alleging failure by the police to arrest him.  The letter written by the victim and addressed to Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava and Home Minister Amit Shah also questioned why the prosecution had failed to demand his presence at the time of filing an anticipatory bail application by the accused.  “This shocking degree of insensitivity towards my case is deeply distressing, and also makes me understand the true reason as to why so many rape victims in our country choose to suffer in silence, rather than to seek justice against their perpetrators,” said the victim in her letter, a copy of which is accessed by India Legal. The letter comes two days after the Delhi High Court granted interim protection from arrest to ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath in a case registered against him under charges of rape. A single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta on April 9 granted the relief, however, she clarified that the same would only be provided if Hiremath joins the investigation. Mumbai-based ET Now Anchor Varun Hiremath has been accused of raping a 22-year-old Pune-based woman in New Delhi. The journalist was anticipating arrest in connection with the FIR lodged by the woman in Chanakyapuri Police station under sec. 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint, the woman had alleged that she was raped by Hiremath in ITC Maurya Hotel in Chanakyapuri. However, Hiremath denied the allegation as false and frivolous as the FIR was registered after a delay of 3 days i.e on 23rd February 2021. Thereafter, Hiremath moved the Bombay High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail which was rejected last month. While rejecting the plea, Justice P.D. Naik observed that the applicant is charged under Section 376 of IPC, hence, the court is not inclined to grant such relief in this case.

In yet another major development in the rape case against ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath, the victim has written to Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Police Commissioner alleging failure by the police to arrest him.  The letter written by the victim and addressed to Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava and Home Minister Amit Shah also questioned why the prosecution had failed to demand his presence at the time of filing an anticipatory bail application by the accused.  “This shocking degree of insensitivity towards my case is deeply distressing, and also makes me understand the true reason as to why so many rape victims in our country choose to suffer in silence, rather than to seek justice against their perpetrators,” said the victim in her letter, a copy of which is accessed by India Legal. The letter comes two days after the Delhi High Court granted interim protection from arrest to ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath in a case registered against him under charges of rape. A single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta on April 9 granted the relief, however, she clarified that the same would only be provided if Hiremath joins the investigation. Mumbai-based ET Now Anchor Varun Hiremath has been accused of raping a 22-year-old Pune-based woman in New Delhi. The journalist was anticipating arrest in connection with the FIR lodged by the woman in Chanakyapuri Police station under sec. 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint, the woman had alleged that she was raped by Hiremath in ITC Maurya Hotel in Chanakyapuri. However, Hiremath denied the allegation as false and frivolous as the FIR was registered after a delay of 3 days i.e on 23rd February 2021. Thereafter, Hiremath moved the Bombay High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail which was rejected last month. While rejecting the plea, Justice P.D. Naik observed that the applicant is charged under Section 376 of IPC, hence, the court is not inclined to grant such relief in this case. However, the applicant may approach the appropriate court, the Judge had said. Later, a Delhi court had also refused the anticipatory bail application of Hiremath, while observing that if the woman states in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent.

Two years ago, I had the honour of interacting with him personally at a well-attended conclave of prominent judges and eminent members of the legal profession discussing the Insolvency and Banktuptcy Code, (IBC) a major reform measure.  At a professional level, his reasoning, analytical abilities, depth of knowledge and presentation skills in handling a highly specialised and complex subject were unbeatable. At a personal level, I found him ruminative, soft-spoken, courtly and conscientious but, most of all, infectiously humble.  He has chaired several committees related to the IBC law, a commendable initiative that has helped India leapfrog ahead in the list of countries known for the ease of doing business.  In fact, IBC has changed the whole thought process in the insolvency sector. The entire thrust of IBC is in the revival of sick businesses. Such is the impact of IBC today that there is hardly a day where developments related to it do not get reported in the press, either local or national. In addition to his unique expertise on specific subjects, Justice Ramana, during his long tenure as a judge of the Supreme Court, has been party to numerous judgments. Notable judgments include:   (2019), dealing with the Right to Information Act, 2005,   (2020) and  ’s case which held that compensation for housewives must depend on the work being performed by them, therefore granting dignity to women who are homemakers.  The judgments in   and   have paved the way for flexibility of appointments to tribunals and the autonomy and freedom of state governments to design their own fiscal legislation respectively. Our curtain-raiser story in last week’s issue, described Justice Ramana  as a “kind, considerate and soft-spoken judge, who is eager to do justice and give counsel appearing before him a patient hearing with an open mind. His vast experience of being a judge for some 20 years, eight of which have been acquired in the apex court, will come to his aid in a remarkable way”. We also pointed out that his understanding of the higher judiciary as the chief justice of the Delhi High Court and acting chief justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court provided him great perspective while carrying out his duties as the fountainhead and paterfamilias of the judiciary. His tenure as a government counsel for various departments and as an additional advocate general have given him a deep understanding of the functioning of government departments, bringing to fore his expertise in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters. His humble beginnings, our article noted last week:   “have given him an insight into the suffering of the common man, which has also made him a champion of civil liberties from the very beginning of his college days and later as a journalist. He has great empathy for those requiring protection of human rights. His tenure, no doubt, will be marked by compassion, expertise and wisdom”. As the head of one of the three pillars of the State, it becomes the responsibility of the CJI to ensure that reformation and transformation continue faster than ever. The disposal rate of cases across the country must move ahead at least twice the speed with which matters get filed. The functioning of all the tiers of the courts and the tribunals are matters of great concern and requires the attention of the CJI. We wish him a happy journey ahead. \n \n \n   \n \n", "image_url": "<img width=\"1068\" height=\"601\" class=\"entry-thumb\" src=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1068x601.jpg\" srcset=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-696x392.jpg 696w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-747x420.jpg 747w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1068px) 100vw, 1068px\" alt=\"CJI Ramana\" title=\"CJI Ramana\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162843", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer   on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said.   The US Navy said it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state.   The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.”   The MEA added: “The   was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile, the US Seventh Fleet said: “  (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”   It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162842", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17240", "source": "scrapy"},

Both incidents took place in Cooch Behar of North Bengal, the BJP’s stronghold. The Election Commission said that the CISF had to fire in order to save lives of voters who came to vote, put in place certain restrictions, including extending the \"silence period\" from 48 hours to 72 hours for the fifth phase of polling West Bengal. It also barred the entry of politicians in Cooch Behar district for the next 72 hours to prevent any possible law and order flare-up.   The shocking incident took place at around 10.30 am when a group of TMC workers stormed a polling booth (No. 126) at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra in Shitalkuchi Assembly constituency. Facing their attack, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) troopers, who were guarding the booth, fired on the mob and shot dead four persons — Hamidul Haque, Monirul Haque, Samiul Mian and Amjad Hossain — while injuring three others.  According to the CISF, the mob of around 150 first manhandled the polling staff at the booth. Sources said they were not “armed”, but some were carrying bamboo sticks. \"The CISF booth commander tried to pacify the miscreants but the mob entered the polling booth and beat up the other polling staff on duty. Few miscreants tried to snatch the weapons of CISF personnel deployed there. As a result, CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air but the mob did not pay any heed to the warning. In the meantime, a quick response team of the CISF and police also reached the spot. The mob further started advancing aggressively towards CISF personnel. Therefore, sensing imminent danger to their life, they fired seven more rounds towards the advancing mob of miscreants. While the above incident was going on, more police parties also arrived at the booth. It is reported that in self-defence they have also fired a few rounds,\" the CISF said.   Polling was stopped immediately by the EC.  The CISF's justification of \"self-defence\" was supported by the district police and administration in its preliminary report to the EC which, issuing the CISF a clean chit later, said, \"Recourse to open fire by CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save lives of voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as mob had attempted to snatch their weapons.\" The TMC, however, described the shooting as “cold-blooded murder\" of its workers in its complaint to Chief Electoral Officer West Bengal Ariz Aftab. Spewing venom against the Central forces and Union home minister Amit Shah, an angry chief minister flew to Siliguri and announced that the Criminal Investigation Department would probe the killings.    The TMC chief is likely to visit the kin of the deceased on Sunday though the EC has banned the entry of any politician of any level in Shitalkuchi.  The tragic incident follows party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee's recent statements that the Central forces were acting in a biased manner at the behest of the BJP and asking voters to gherao them. On Saturday, her party landed in the dock after its workers shot dead a first-time voter, Ananda Burman (18), in the same district. The teenaged boy was standing in a queue outside a polling booth (No. 285) at Pathantuli Shalbari area when a scuffle broke out between TMC and BJP workers.

Less than half that number said yes.", "text": "BESSEMER, Ala. — Amazon warehouse workers here voted overwhelmingly against forming a union Friday after a monthslong campaign in which labor had hoped to make inroads into the sprawling company. As of Friday morning, 1,798 employees voted against unionizing, compared to 738 in favor. If it had been approved, the union would have been the first in the United States for Amazon, the country's second-largest employer. Even as the vote was being completed, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, the union seeking to represent the 5,800 workers in Bessemer, said it would challenge the vote by filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. It will allege that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity in the run-up to the election. “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon's behavior in corrupting this election,\" said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU. “Working people deserve better than the way Amazon has conducted itself during this campaign. This campaign has proven that the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is to join together in a union. However, Amazon’s behavior during the election cannot be ignored and our union will seek remedy to each and every improper action Amazon took. We won’t rest until workers' voices are heard fairly under the law.\" Amazon disputed these charges in a blog   after the vote concluded. \"It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,\" the post read. \"Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.\" After the seven-week window to vote by mail ended March 29, the NLRB spent two weeks checking the eligibility of ballots and counting them in a process observed by the union and Amazon. Out of 5,876 eligible voters, 3,041 ballots were cast, but 505 were set aside as contested, mostly by Amazon, according to the union. Ballots can be contested by Amazon or the union based on factors like illegible signatures or questions about whether employees' job titles entitle them to vote. Those ballots are counted only if the final margin is small enough. Labor experts said the results are not a surprise, given the resources Amazon has invested in countering organizing. \"It's so hard for workers to win in a situation like this,\" said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \"The most likely outcome in these situations is that the employer successfully busts the union by instilling fear and uncertainty into the workers, and even those workers that were initially in favor of organizing into a union get afraid and change their mind.\" The Bessemer warehouse, which opened in March 2020, is Amazon's first fulfillment center in Alabama. Workers started organizing toward a union vote in August, hoping it would help improve their working conditions. Currently, it is difficult to go to the bathroom without being penalized, said Jennifer Bates, an Amazon worker in Bessemer, who said she was inspired to support the union effort after regularly having seen her colleagues walk out of work limping from the physical toll the job takes. At the start of this year, Amazon launched what labor experts characterized as a classic, well-funded anti-union campaign at the warehouse. Workers said they were required to attend multiple meetings during their shifts, in which Amazon representatives explained why a union was not, in their view, beneficial for workers. Posters all over the warehouse, some of them in bathroom stalls, encouraged workers to vote no. The company also distributed buttons and stickers for employees to wear, and it created a website and a hashtag, #DoItWithoutDues, highlighting how workers might have to pay $500 in annual dues to the union. Amazon has a  . In 1999, the Communication Workers of America started a campaign to unionize 400 customer service employees in Seattle. After months of anti-union campaigning, Amazon closed down the call center in 2000 in what the company said was a restructuring related to the dot-com bust. In 2014, 21 equipment technicians at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware   following what the union spokesman described as \"intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants.\" Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako   at the time that the \"no\" vote against third-party representation showed that employees \"prefer a direct connection with Amazon.\" Workers in Bessemer who opposed the union seemed to question its purpose. LaVonette Stokes, who works as a labor organizer for the Alabama teachers union when she's not working at Amazon, and her husband are have positions as mid-level process guides that earn $15 to $19 an hour. But she said that a union for unskilled labor in Bessemer makes no sense and that it would move too slowly. She and her husband spent $2,400 of their own money to print flyers that detailed Amazon's benefits. \"We're talking about a union that has made contracts where, yes, they got a raise, but it took them about five to seven years before they even got to that raise,\" she said. Her husband, William, said: \"We're not against unions. We're against this particular union, and we're against a union at this particular facility. Everything that this union is offering, we can do ourselves.\" Workers in favor of the union said they had hoped it would help improve their working conditions, providing better job security and benefits when Amazon is   in part because of a pandemic-induced boom in online retail. \"I like my job. I give it 110 percent every day I go in there, regardless how hard it is, how stressful it is,\" said Darryl Richardson, a worker at the Bessemer warehouse. \"But I feel like employees deserve better and more for what they do.\" Richardson said he and other pro-union workers expect to be fired or forced to quit their jobs. \"I have to move on, and I hate it,\" he said. \"It's sad that you do everything you can to try to make things better for the people and you feel like you are going to lose your job.\" Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, said in an email, \"We respect all our employees' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment.\" Amazon spokesperson Leah Seay said that in Bessemer receive health care coverage and hourly pay of at least $15.30, which is well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Alabama has no minimum wage law. Employees also get a retirement plan, Seay said. Despite the ultimate vote against unionizing, the drive attracted global attention to conditions for Amazon's warehouse workers and the  , said Givan, the Rutgers professor. \"Workers around the country who have been watching what's happening will be potentially inspired by what can happen if you do take action and get national attention,\" she said. It also drew attention from other unions. Following the results, Randy Korgan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Director for Amazon praised workers' attempts to unionize. “Despite going up against one of the world’s richest men in a country with weak labor laws, the workers in Bessemer brought national attention to issues that many non-union workers face in this industry,\" said Korgan. \"This fight is not over, and the Teamsters will always support workers who want to build power by standing together and demanding dignity, a safe workplace, and a fair return on their work.” Analysts said efforts to unionize at other Amazon warehouses in the U.S. are likely to continue, particularly in higher-cost states like New York and California. RWDSU spokesperson Chelsea Connor said the union received over a thousand inquiries about organizing from Amazon workers at other facilities since the organizing effort began. \"Amazon is already about the best-paying job a non-skilled laborer can get in Alabama,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"But in higher-costs states, it's barely a living wage. \"It will cut into profits,\" he said. \"But it's a humane thing to do.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202104/1617986891265_ott_now_amazon_210409_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162844", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "62254", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.deccanchronicle.com", "section": "Top Stories", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/110421/polavaram-will-render-people-from-192-villages-homeless.html", "title": "Polavaram will render people from 192 villages homeless", "author": "\n\t\t\tDECCAN CHRONICLE.", "author_link": "", "published_date": "Apr 11, 2021, 11:58 pm IST", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Fearing submergence, locals demand compensation, safer living places", "text": ": All those who have been displaced from 192 villages because of Polavaram Project are living in fear amid insecurity.

The musical drama is set to release on 16 April in three languages- Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu. It will open pan-India, except in Maharashtra where the government announced a weekend lockdown to curb the growing numbers of   cases. \"There is pressure. This is not a formulaic film. Come with low expectations and high hopes but come to theatres with all safety precautions,\" Rahman told   in a Zoom interview from Chennai. The 54-year-old composer, who gave the interview a week before Maharashtra announced the lockdown, said people need to see the film on the big screen. \"There is fear... Everyone is wondering \"how the hell is he releasing the film now, is he crazy?\" But I think the movie has to come out, people need to see it on the big screen. It is a cinematic experience,\" Rahman said. The musician firmly believes that a film's box office success will have a ripple effect on the entertainment sector, which has been hit badly due to the pandemic. \"This is the time people should encourage filmmakers and producers because one film's success is the entire industry's success. There are so many people losing hope, crying, thinking about the future. We are proud to have the courage to release it, hoping that people come wearing masks, stay safe and enjoy the film,\" he said. Directed by Vishwesh Krishnamoorthy,  is co-written and produced by Rahman. He has also composed the film's soundtrack. The film stars debutants Ehan Bhat and Edilsy Vargas in lead roles. The journey of the film began in 2010 when the composer decided to produce a movie. He came up with three rough story ideas and pitched them to his friends for feedback. All of them had their hearts set on one idea which eventually became  \"The core idea is like a fairytale. What if a guy has to write 100 songs to win over a girl?\" Rahman said. A major Bollywood studio initially came on board to back the film but the deal fell through. He eventually found a co-producer in Ideal Entertainment who gave him complete freedom. \"We had a corporate production but I felt I would need more freedom to make the film. A panel of 12 people coming in and asking questions constantly was daunting. We quietly went off-grid from there and found Ideal Entertainment, who believed in the vision. Their excitement was empowering,\" Rahman said. Once the film had enough financial backing, the composer started scouting for a director who could bring to life his vision. He zeroed in on Krishnamoorthy, who had directed MTV's musical show,   which Rahman \"absolutely loved\". Rahman, one of the most regarded musicians in India and abroad for his compositions in films such as   and   to name just a few, said though he was juggling production and scoring music, there was never a thought to turn director for  \"I was clear that I wouldn't direct. I was inexperienced in direction. I am not a person who goes in front of people and directs, I am an introvert. \"I did direct a virtual reality experience which is coming out this year as an installation because it required only 18 days of shooting and four years of post-production. That I did, also because it wasn't with Indian crew, so the inhibition was not there.\"  is billed as a story about the self-discovery of a struggling singer, who wants to be a successful music composer. Rahman said the team was conscious to not turn the movie into merely a musical as they felt that the audience had increasingly become \"restless\" and wouldn't have the patience to sit through it without being distracted. \"We had to find a way, decide what the emotional core of the film will be. It could not be just a musical. Because who's going to sit through a musical in these days when everyone is so restless and wants to know what's happening on Twitter. \"We had to make it a rollercoaster ride, so that we pin them down, hoping they don't check their phone,\" he added.

If he’s ever going to prove his point, now is the time. The television executive is behind the network’s 2019 revival and, since he began working last fall to convince Minnesota authorities to televise Derek Chauvin’s trial, has seen the case as an opportunity to let more people know that   is back. Early returns are encouraging: The network says the number of live streams of   programming during the first week of the former Minneapolis police officer’s trial for the murder of George Floyd was 20 times what it was pre-trial. “When you say  , everyone knows who you are,” said Tufts, the network’s senior vice president. “But when you launch a new network, people have to find you.” Originally started by journalist Steven Brill in 1991,   became known for coverage of sensational trials involving OJ Simpson and the Menendez brothers. But then-corporate owner Time Warner changed it to   in 2008, believing a broader-based entertainment network would have more appeal. Tufts, who has been involved in legal programming since producing  ’s   in the 1990s, believed owners gave up too soon. He never lost faith in   as a concept and tried to convince media companies to bring it back. Katz Broadcasting, a subsidiary of the EW Scripps Co, agreed to try. Similarly, some of the people who worked on   yearned for their own chance to return, said Michael Ayala. He was a reporter for   in the 1990s, left to work at CBS stations in Chicago and Washington, and is now back as a   anchor. Vinnie Politan, an anchor, is another returnee, along with a handful of behind-the-scenes employees. “It feels fantastic,” Ayala said. “I cannot express to you enough how happy I am.” Virtually all lawyers in the early days, the network now has more people with television experience, he said. But the focus on covering issues from a legal perspective hasn’t changed. In prime time this week, for example, Ayala discussed a US Supreme Court ruling on the use of force by police officers and how Chauvin’s attorney quoted from it during a cross-examination. Viewer opinion was solicited on the question of whether Chauvin was justified in believing that the crowd at the scene of Floyd’s death posed a threat. Anyone who watched  ’s programming during the Simpson trial will find coverage of the Chauvin case to be similar, Ayala told  . Not only was Minnesota convinced by   and other media organisations to televise the Chauvin trial, but   cameras provide the video feed for colleagues. “I’m proud of our team,” Tufts said. “We’ve delivered on our mission to provide expert analysis based on facts and the law. So much (other) coverage is devoted to one political position or another.” He said he went into the Chauvin trial with hopes that   would get an audience boost of 20 percent to 50 percent. Nielsen says the first week provided   with its biggest television audience since the reboot, and suggests that Tufts’ goal may have been too modest. “It has given viewers a broader awareness that we’re there,” he said. While the pandemic has cut down on the number of trials available for television, it has provided one gift, even if temporary. The US Supreme Court has held arguments on many of its cases by teleconference, and   has been airing that audio. Tufts acquired the entire   library of programming from 1991 until its end, including all the old trial tapes. It took seven semi-trailers to transport tapes from storage in New Jersey to the new Atlanta headquarters, and the material is being digitally converted. It was already mined for a 25-part series on the 25th anniversary of the Simpson trial.  faces competition it did not have before, including Dan Abrams’ Law & Crime Network, which has operated since 2017. YouTube is also a popular destination for people interested in old trial footage, said Larry Gerbrandt, principal in Media Valuation Partners, which consults on media properties. “It’s a little bit of a gift to be the channel of record (on the Chauvin trial) and essentially cover it gavel to gavel,” he said. Gerbrandt said success largely depends on its ability to be seen in as many places as possible.   says it is already available in 93 percent of the nation’s homes with television, and also streams its programming for free. The plan is to build   into an expansive media empire, Tufts said. “Everything we’ve seen over the past few years is that people know the   brand,” he said. “They trust the   brand and think that it could and should have a place on television.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Derek Chauvin trial puts Court TV's revival in the public eye\" alt=\"Derek Chauvin trial puts Court TV's revival in the public eye\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/courttv640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162844", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "43450", "source": "scrapy"},

The Central forces gunned down four persons at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar. Another death also happened in the morning. From the very first day I have been vocal. Central forces are not my enemy.

I request the Election Commission to take stringent action on the accused of the incident.\" He however told Ms Banerjee, \"But your tricks to provoke the people in attacking the Central forces on poll-duty and obstruct the polling process will not be able to save you. Your violence after a decade-long misdeed cannot save you. People are casting their votes in large numbers for BJP. North Bengal has shown it.\"    Standing by the Central forces for their role in the poll duty, Mr Modi observed that the TMC chief, not the forces, has become the biggest trouble in the polls.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162844", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16581", "source": "scrapy"},

Less than half that number said yes.", "text": "BESSEMER, Ala. — Amazon warehouse workers here voted overwhelmingly against forming a union Friday after a monthslong campaign in which labor had hoped to make inroads into the sprawling company. As of Friday morning, 1,798 employees voted against unionizing, compared to 738 in favor. If it had been approved, the union would have been the first in the United States for Amazon, the country's second-largest employer. Even as the vote was being completed, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, the union seeking to represent the 5,800 workers in Bessemer, said it would challenge the vote by filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. It will allege that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity in the run-up to the election. “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon's behavior in corrupting this election,\" said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU. “Working people deserve better than the way Amazon has conducted itself during this campaign. This campaign has proven that the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is to join together in a union. However, Amazon’s behavior during the election cannot be ignored and our union will seek remedy to each and every improper action Amazon took. We won’t rest until workers' voices are heard fairly under the law.\" Amazon disputed these charges in a blog   after the vote concluded. \"It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,\" the post read. \"Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.\" After the seven-week window to vote by mail ended March 29, the NLRB spent two weeks checking the eligibility of ballots and counting them in a process observed by the union and Amazon. Out of 5,876 eligible voters, 3,041 ballots were cast, but 505 were set aside as contested, mostly by Amazon, according to the union. Ballots can be contested by Amazon or the union based on factors like illegible signatures or questions about whether employees' job titles entitle them to vote. Those ballots are counted only if the final margin is small enough. Labor experts said the results are not a surprise, given the resources Amazon has invested in countering organizing. \"It's so hard for workers to win in a situation like this,\" said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \"The most likely outcome in these situations is that the employer successfully busts the union by instilling fear and uncertainty into the workers, and even those workers that were initially in favor of organizing into a union get afraid and change their mind.\" The Bessemer warehouse, which opened in March 2020, is Amazon's first fulfillment center in Alabama. Workers started organizing toward a union vote in August, hoping it would help improve their working conditions. Currently, it is difficult to go to the bathroom without being penalized, said Jennifer Bates, an Amazon worker in Bessemer, who said she was inspired to support the union effort after regularly having seen her colleagues walk out of work limping from the physical toll the job takes. At the start of this year, Amazon launched what labor experts characterized as a classic, well-funded anti-union campaign at the warehouse. Workers said they were required to attend multiple meetings during their shifts, in which Amazon representatives explained why a union was not, in their view, beneficial for workers. Posters all over the warehouse, some of them in bathroom stalls, encouraged workers to vote no. The company also distributed buttons and stickers for employees to wear, and it created a website and a hashtag, #DoItWithoutDues, highlighting how workers might have to pay $500 in annual dues to the union. Amazon has a  . In 1999, the Communication Workers of America started a campaign to unionize 400 customer service employees in Seattle. After months of anti-union campaigning, Amazon closed down the call center in 2000 in what the company said was a restructuring related to the dot-com bust. In 2014, 21 equipment technicians at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware   following what the union spokesman described as \"intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants.\" Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako   at the time that the \"no\" vote against third-party representation showed that employees \"prefer a direct connection with Amazon.\" Workers in Bessemer who opposed the union seemed to question its purpose. LaVonette Stokes, who works as a labor organizer for the Alabama teachers union when she's not working at Amazon, and her husband are have positions as mid-level process guides that earn $15 to $19 an hour. But she said that a union for unskilled labor in Bessemer makes no sense and that it would move too slowly. She and her husband spent $2,400 of their own money to print flyers that detailed Amazon's benefits. \"We're talking about a union that has made contracts where, yes, they got a raise, but it took them about five to seven years before they even got to that raise,\" she said. Her husband, William, said: \"We're not against unions. We're against this particular union, and we're against a union at this particular facility. Everything that this union is offering, we can do ourselves.\" Workers in favor of the union said they had hoped it would help improve their working conditions, providing better job security and benefits when Amazon is   in part because of a pandemic-induced boom in online retail. \"I like my job. I give it 110 percent every day I go in there, regardless how hard it is, how stressful it is,\" said Darryl Richardson, a worker at the Bessemer warehouse. \"But I feel like employees deserve better and more for what they do.\" Richardson said he and other pro-union workers expect to be fired or forced to quit their jobs. \"I have to move on, and I hate it,\" he said. \"It's sad that you do everything you can to try to make things better for the people and you feel like you are going to lose your job.\" Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, said in an email, \"We respect all our employees' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment.\" Amazon spokesperson Leah Seay said that in Bessemer receive health care coverage and hourly pay of at least $15.30, which is well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Alabama has no minimum wage law. Employees also get a retirement plan, Seay said. Despite the ultimate vote against unionizing, the drive attracted global attention to conditions for Amazon's warehouse workers and the  , said Givan, the Rutgers professor. \"Workers around the country who have been watching what's happening will be potentially inspired by what can happen if you do take action and get national attention,\" she said. It also drew attention from other unions. Following the results, Randy Korgan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Director for Amazon praised workers' attempts to unionize. “Despite going up against one of the world’s richest men in a country with weak labor laws, the workers in Bessemer brought national attention to issues that many non-union workers face in this industry,\" said Korgan. \"This fight is not over, and the Teamsters will always support workers who want to build power by standing together and demanding dignity, a safe workplace, and a fair return on their work.” Analysts said efforts to unionize at other Amazon warehouses in the U.S. are likely to continue, particularly in higher-cost states like New York and California. RWDSU spokesperson Chelsea Connor said the union received over a thousand inquiries about organizing from Amazon workers at other facilities since the organizing effort began. \"Amazon is already about the best-paying job a non-skilled laborer can get in Alabama,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"But in higher-costs states, it's barely a living wage. \"It will cut into profits,\" he said. \"But it's a humane thing to do.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202104/1617986891265_ott_now_amazon_210409_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162847", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "62254", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.seelatest.com", "section": "education", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.seelatest.com/date-sheet/goa-board-class-10th-date-sheet-2021-released-ssc-exams-from-13th-may", "title": "\n                                        ", "author": "\n                                                                                        By ", "author_link": "https://www.seelatest.com/author/rohitsindhu", "published_date": "\n                                        ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": " Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (GBSHSE) has released the final   for Class 10th or SSC exams 2021.

It also comes as an opportunity for those seeking to make a shift toward healthier living. Well, why not start today! As per World Health Organisation (WHO), this year's  World Health Day theme is 'Building a fairer, healthier world'.  Stating that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the countries hard, WHO mentioned that ours is an unequal world where \"some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income...little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services.\" WHO urged leaders around the world to \"monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.\" And while people across the globe are still struggling to come to terms with how much life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a U.K.-based price comparison website Money.co.uk has come out with a list of the world’s healthiest countries in 2021. The publications release this list every year and this time too it has been published on World Health Day.  The publication mentioned that their mortgage experts rank the healthiest countries and cities in the world on the basis of \"good food, good company and good transport links\". Additionally, conditions like air quality, pollution levels, cost of living, life expectancy among other things are taken into consideration.  Below is the list of the top 5 world's healthiest countries. According to the report, Spain is the healthiest country in the world. It mentioned a few reasons such as their Mediterranean lifestyle, walking as a mode of transport, which helps to lower deaths caused by pollution, cost of living is moderate among other things why the country topped their list.  l: As per the report, Portugal bagged the second spot on the list of the world's healthiest countries. Their high-ranking healthcare system is the reason why the country has achieved good rankings in several health indices over the years, including this one.  Switzerland is home to one of the happiest populations. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum's 2013 Human Capital Report, Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world.  Home to the oldest living population in the world, Japan obviously has one of the highest life expectancies in the world! Other factors that contribute to Japan being in the top five are: their smaller portion sizes and protein-dense diet, their notoriously fast transportation, walking as the preferred mode of transportation and high cost of living matched with the price among other things.   Good healthcare system, healthy diet and clean water among other things such as low levels of smoking, makes Iceland one of the world's healthiest countries to live in. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162847", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34623", "source": "scrapy"},

Some moments and memories are so special that all it takes is a small sensory cue to take one to a different timeline of one's life. This is often captured by the expression 'madeleine de proust' one of the key passages in Marcel Proust book 'In search of lost time' when a particular sight, smell, food, a song, or an experience unexpectedly unlocks a past recollection. For instance, the smell of jasmine flowers reminds me of my grandmother and how fondly she used to place them near her pillow. It's not uncommon when a simple song triggers a plethora of past memories. No wonder when sometimes I miss my mother near me, I try to do or make something exactly the way she does to intentionally create a madeleine moment and then soak myself in the nostalgia and priceless feelings associated with childhood memories. The reverse is also true. There are events or moments of life thinking about which can make one feel awful. It could be related to anything in the past like the unexpected loss of a loved one, changing dynamics of cherished relationships, emotionally taxing incidents or the struggles in the present moment that instantly makes one negative. Sometimes when a negative situation stays for too long, it can leave one overwhelmed in a way that the person seems to be addicted to negativity or develops a habit of ruminating. For instance, acting as a caregiver where hopes are not high, clinging to a toxic relationship or sticking with the wrong job because of one's helpless condition perceived or real. Rumination is continuously getting lost in a thought loop where you eventually end up thinking about that same negative or sad thought or experience. Why is it that we end up remembering what we want to forget? Perhaps negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that even when an individual has made a conscious thought to not pay heed to it, it keeps coming back. One of the reasons people ruminate is owing to the belief that by ruminating they will probably get an insight into their life or problem. However, it doesn't work out because in a state of ruminating the person is focused more on the problems and consequences instead of solutions. The person may perceive it as natural coping mechanism to adapt with the pain, but one has to ponder whether it's helping one solve a problem or just trapping back in an unhealthy thought cycle. Dwelling on negative thoughts and engaging in self-blame has been associated with mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Research by Peter Kinderman professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they had experienced many negative events in their lives. The question is how to intentionally forget things that only serve to disturb us. Can we exercise influence on our memory? Perhaps the easiest way to forget something is not revisiting it in your mind. There are many theories related to the process of motivated forgetting that suggest that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. According to Freud, memories that are likely to induce guilt, embarrassment, shame or anxiety are actively, but unconsciously, pushed out of consciousness as a form of ego defence. Unconscious or repressed memories are exceedingly difficult to retrieve but remain available. People may resort to 'repression' in which they subconsciously push unpleasant thoughts and feelings into their unconscious as an automatic defensive mechanism. Thought 'suppression' is also a  type of motivated forgetting when an individual consciously attempts to stop thinking about a particular thought. Memories are also forgotten through distortion as perGestalt theory of forgetting. This is also called false memory syndrome in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by false memories, recollections that are factually incorrect but yet are strongly believed. Rehearsing negative memories by ruminating over them only serve to strengthen them, so it's important to forget certain things to live life peacefully. Apparently, we may never forget things completely but when we stop thinking about them, it often fades away as we remember fewer facts. If rumination is affecting your personal growth stop and take notice of the circumstances and triggers that lead you to ruminate. Eliminating the trigger may not be possible always but by practicing mindfulness one can consciously try to respond with an element of awareness breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. This may require consistent practice and conscious efforts but it's important to check yourself lest negativity pulls you into a trap again. Finding a distraction like going for a walk, playing a game, calling a friend, watching a movie or getting engaged in any activity that breaks the chain can also be helpful. If constant rumination is disabling you and you are unable to focus your attention on other important things of life, seeking therapy can be beneficial. Otherwise meditating can also reduce rumination because it helps in de cluttering the mind to arrive at an emotionally calm state. Life is fleeting and made up of a collection of moments. Clinging on to negative experiences will only make us miss out on the beauty of 'now'.Next time if your answer to this question 'Do you remember what you want to forget?' carries away your mind to unpleasant memories and events, change the question itself. Ask yourself - 'Do you forget what you want to remember?' Answering it will not only break the thought cycle and distract your mind but transport you to all the beautiful memories and the blessings in the present moment, that perhaps money can't buy but fills the heart with gratitude.

The country has enough stock of the drug in question, “Avifavir” to treat 60,000 coronavirus patients in one month, and the hospitals across the country will begin administering it from June 11, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has left no country untouched from its impact and has triggered one of the biggest recessions in the history of modern civilisation. Most economic activity has been suspended and chains of supply have been disrupted causing trouble for all economies which are now reopening slowly to recover from the impact. As per now, no vaccine has been approved to contain the spread of COVID-19. The deadly virus continues to claim lives of people across the globe, with over 100,000 deaths in the United States alone. The number of cases are jumping rapidly in Brazil and India. Russia saw a major increase in the number of cases two weeks ago, with fears of it becoming a hotspot. \r\n \r\n The modified antiviral drug “Avifavir” was approved by Russian health ministry very recently. After conducting clinical trials, the drug was officially approved for use on Saturday. According to Reuters, over 330 people were part of this trial, and they found that the drug was able to successfully treat patients within four days of beginning treatment. More trials are expected to continue in the country to ascertain the usefulness of the drug. The country has begun manufacturing the drug in March itself, which will soon be used for mass treatments. Touted by Russia as a “game changer”, the health ministry believes the “drug is key to resuming full activity in Russia”. The new drug, however has some side effects and is not suggested for treating pregnant women. The third most hard-hit country in the world, Russia has witnessed 4,693 deaths due to the pandemic, but has recorded a low fatality rate. The drug was initially developed in the 1990s by a Japanese health company, which is now owned by Fujifilm. The generic name of the drug is “favipiravir”.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/06/01/142701-untitled-design.jpg?itok=cwyTXU_T\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162847", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21951", "source": "scrapy"},

Apple’s 2020 iPhone series includes the newly launched Apple iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and the compact iPhone 12 Mini. Apple also introduced the brand new and more compact home audio system namely the HomePod Mini that has been priced at Rs 9,900. This is the smaller version of the original speaker that is more compact in size. Here is a quick detail about all the brand new iPhone 12 Variants- The new iPhone 12 features the same 6.1-inch display as the iPhone 11 and the XR. The phone shows a transition from the previous IPS display to an OLED screen. The iPhone 12 will be made accessible in the international markets from 23 October. The design is similar to the previous generation iPhone 5 series with the flat aluminum sides. Apple tells the water-resistance of the device has been enhanced and it also offers support for Dolby Vision, HDR 10. There is also a notch at the top that works for the phone’s Face ID tech. iPhone 12 is powered by the latest A14 Bionic processor which is the first chipset built on a 5-nanometer processor. Apple claims that it’s 50 percent faster than conventional chipsets on Android devices. The camera setup of the new iPhone 12 has a 12+12-megapixel camera along with ultrawide sensor. The low-light performance is also enhanced. iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max comes with a stainless steel design with four unique color variants: grey, stainless steel, gold, and a new blue.  The Pro model comes with a display of 6.1-inch while the iPhone Pro Max is a much bigger 6.7-inch model.  Pro models also come with A14 Bionic processor. The iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, also provides12-megapixel triple rear cameras with a wide (f/1.6), ultra-wide (f/2.4), and an additional telephoto (f/2.0 on Pro and f/2.2 on Pro Max) lens. They also have a LiDAR (a portmanteau of light and radar) scanner for better autofocus in low light (and Night-mode Portraits), improved depth photography. The iPhone 12 Pro Max comes with a feature that holds a 47 percent larger wide camera sensor.

Genocide, the nations declared, was “condemned by the civilized world” and justified intervention in the affairs of sovereign states. Now, a small but growing number of world leaders including Pope Francis and French President Emmanuel Macron have begun citing an offense they say poses a similar threat to humanity and remains beyond the reach of international criminal law: ecocide, or widespread destruction of the environment. The pope describes ecocide as “the massive contamination of air, land and water,” or “any action capable of producing an ecological disaster,” and   it a sin for Roman Catholics. The Pontiff has also endorsed a campaign by environmental activists and legal scholars to make ecocide the fifth crime before the International Criminal Court in The Hague as a legal deterrent to the kinds of far-reaching environmental damage that are driving mass extinction, ecological collapse and climate change. The monumental step, which faces a long road of global debate, would mean political leaders and corporate executives could face charges and imprisonment for \"ecocidal\" acts. To make their case, advocates point to the Amazon, where fires raged out of control in 2019, and where the rainforest may now be so degraded   than it draws in. At the poles, human activity is thawing a frozen Arctic and destabilizing the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Across the globe, climate change is disrupting the reliable seasonal rhythms that have sustained human life for millennia, while hurricanes, floods and other climate-driven disasters have   in the last six months. Fossil fuel pollution has   annually in recent years, according to a study in Environmental Research, more than tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS combined. One in 4 mammals  . For amphibians, it’s 4 in 10. Damage to nature has become so extensive and widespread around the world that many environmentalists speak of ecocide to describe numerous environmentally devastated hot spots: The campaign to criminalize ecocide is now moving from the fringe of advocacy into global diplomacy, pushed by a growing recognition among advocates and many political leaders that climate change and environmental causes are tied inherently to human rights and social justice. The effort remains a long shot and is at least years from fruition, international and environmental law experts say. Advocates will have to navigate political tensions over whether national governments or the international community have ultimate control over natural resources. And they’ll likely face opposition from countries with high carbon emissions and deep ties to industrial development. The environmentalists must also figure out how criminal law would address climate change, which has been driven by practices like burning coal and gasoline that are not only legal, but central to the global economy. The campaign to make ecocide a crime, however, is about more than law. Jojo Mehta, who launched the Stop Ecocide campaign in 2017 with Polly Higgins, a Scottish lawyer who died in 2019, describes it as a moral and practical issue as well. “We use criminal law to draw moral lines,” Mehta said. “We say something’s not accepted, your murder is not acceptable. And so, simply putting mass damage and destruction of nature below that red line actually makes a huge difference, and it will make a difference to the people that are financing what is going on.” Scott W. Badenoch Jr., an American environmental lawyer who favors the criminalization of ecocide, used the term to describe the state, and fate, of the Earth. “Ecocide is now endemic all over the planet,” he said. “The structures of ecology that have held up living organisms on Earth, since time immemorial, are collapsing everywhere.” He added, “Ecocide is now, frankly, the process that we are living in on Earth.” The concept of ecocide was born of tragedy. Over a period of 10 years, the United States government sprayed   of powerful herbicides, including Agent Orange, across the countryside in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to expose enemy sanctuaries during the Vietnam War. The dioxin-laced chemicals defoliated verdant jungle and caused cancers, neurological disease and birth defects in people living nearby. While the number of victims is disputed,   there are more than 3 million. In 1970, Yale biologist Arthur Galston invoked the destruction to call on the world to outlaw what he called “ecocide.” More than 20 years later, the global community came together to form the International Criminal Court, which was formally established in 2002 under a treaty called the Rome Statute to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes when its member countries, which currently  , fail to do so themselves. Early drafts of the Rome Statute included the crime of environmental destruction,   after opposition from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, based on various concerns, including that it wasn’t precisely defined. Instead, it was relegated to a wartime offense that has never been enforced. As a result, international criminal law includes few guardrails to prevent peacetime environmental destruction. “There's a big gap and something needs to fill it,” said Badenoch, a visiting attorney at the Environmental Law Institute. “We currently cannot hold big corporations or big governments accountable for ecocide,” Badenoch added. “So, what do you do? We name and shame — that's all we've got.” Decades of oil extraction in Nigeria by subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell, for example, have   in parts of the country with benzene and other toxic pollutants, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Civil lawsuits have taken years to wind through European courts, and no laws were strong enough to prevent the damage from happening, though Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary was recently  . Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman,   that says many of the spills have come as a result of sabotage and theft, and that the company has been working with stakeholders to clean up the pollution identified by the U.N. Environment Program. The International Criminal Court's supranational authority would make an ecocide crime particularly powerful, said Kate Mackintosh, executive director of the Promise Institute for Human Rights at the University of California Los Angeles. An ecocide crime would require International Criminal Court members to enact their own national ecocide laws, and failure to enforce those laws would enable the international court to step in. While political leaders and warlords have been the usual targets of the court, an ecocide crime could place business executives on notice, too. “That could make a difference in corporate boardroom conversations,” Mackintosh said. Even the threat of being labeled an international criminal, she said, might deter destructive corporate behavior. “I mean, for PR, it doesn’t look good, does it?” Mackintosh said making ecocide a crime could help in weak states, where corporate polluters are sometimes more powerful than national governments. “The likelihood of any criminal prosecution taking place in that state is pretty low,” she said. “But with an international crime, that’s actually not a bar.” China, the United States, India and Russia — four of the world’s top polluters — are not members of the International Criminal Court, but if a corporation based in one of those countries were to operate within a member state, as many of them do, their executives could fall under the court’s jurisdiction. The push to criminalize ecocide remained on the periphery until December 2019, when Vanuatu and the Maldives, two island nations threatened by rising seas and climate change-driven extreme weather, recommended that the court consider amending its statute to “criminalize acts that amount to ecocide.” “Our legacy and our future are at stake,” Vanuatu’s ambassador to the European Union, John Licht,  , stressing a “common bond” that united all the world’s people. “Our lives are intertwined by the environment we live in.” Willy Missack, who has served as part of Vanuatu’s delegation to the United Nations climate negotiations, said diplomats from other countries expressed shock when “little tiny Vanuatu” — a remote archipelago of more than 80 islands in the South Pacific — said it wanted to take on global powers and the fossil fuel industry through the courts. But the fact that corporations can continue to profit from carbon emissions that are threatening his country’s future, Missack said, makes the legal case clear. “It is not right,” he said, “and this is where justice comes in.” After Vanuatu asked the International Criminal Court to consider criminalizing ecocide, Mehta’s Stop Ecocide Foundation independently convened a panel of international legal experts, including Mackintosh of UCLA, to draft a clear definition of ecocide. They plan to publish their definition in June, at which point they hope at least one of the court’s member nations will formally propose that the court adopt ecocide as the fifth international crime against peace. Mehta has said the definition would likely require   of environmental destruction related to practices like widespread logging, drilling, mining and deep-sea trawling. Richard J. Rogers, a British expert in international criminal law who is a partner at Global Diligence and a member of the drafting panel, said it may be relatively straightforward to criminalize certain acts, like destruction of a forest or waterway. But climate change poses a greater challenge: Not only is it difficult to connect polluters to specific harms, he said, but there’s also nothing illegal about extracting or burning fossil fuels. “The situation we're dealing with is that the carbon system, which has fueled our economies since the Industrial Revolution, has not only been lawful, but it's been encouraged,” Rogers said. Another point that the drafters will have to grapple with is whether the crime of ecocide should require prosecutors to prove that humans have been harmed. Mackintosh said that while this “human harm” threshold could prove appealing politically — the court's existing crimes all largely involve harm to humans — focusing ecocide only on the environment could make it easier for prosecutors to prove, especially when it comes to harms related to climate change, which are often incremental and indirect. If a nation agrees to introduce the ecocide proposal to the International Criminal Court for consideration, that is when even harder work will begin. Ratification is a multistep process that would require support from either two-thirds or seven-eighths of the court’s members, depending on the type of amendment introduced. (Vanuatu still supports the campaign, but Covid-19 and the country’s “limited resources for international diplomacy” have put its ecocide advocacy on hold, said Dreli Solomon, a spokesman for Vanuatu’s embassy in Brussels.) While no country has committed to formally proposing that the court adopt ecocide, the campaign is gaining traction, fueled by the youth-led climate movement and radical new groups like Extinction Rebellion. In December, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès asked International Criminal Court member states to   of adopting ecocide as a crime. A member of Belgium’s Parliament has also proposed a bill to criminalize ecocide. And French lawmakers are working on legislation to make ecocide an   punishable by fines and prison, though Stop Ecocide   as “weak.” At least 10 countries have national ecocide laws already, including Vietnam, which enacted the law in 1990. Separately, French lawyers in January filed a request on behalf of Amazonian indigenous groups asking the International Criminal Court to investigate Bolsonaro of Brazil for crimes against humanity. The appeal alleges that deforestation encouraged by Bolsonaro’s government and other policies have forced indigenous people from their homes and even led to murders in the region. While the request relies on citations of crimes the court already addresses, the lawyers who submitted it     the case is also an example of ecocide. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said in a statement that \"the Bolsonaro administration is taking concrete action to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples and ensure the future of the Amazon.\" The embassy said that over 70 percent of the eligible Indigenous population has received initial Covid-19 vaccinations and that deforestation rates in the Amazon were 21 percent lower from August to January , compared to the same period a year earlier. Badenoch said that while the hurdles to adopting a new international crime are high, they are not insurmountable. “These things take a long time and they are complex,” he said. “But they can be done.” While the campaign for an ecocide law could take years — if it is successful at all — advocates say the effort could bear fruit much sooner: The ecocide campaign has thrust the concept into public discussion. Mehta doesn’t expect the campaign to catch fire in the United States, but after four years of President Donald Trump, she’s heartened by the arrival of John Kerry, Biden’s special climate envoy. “We don’t expect the U.S. to join the ICC any time soon, but that said, the conversation around ecocide itself, we don’t see any reason why it can’t start happening in the U.S.,” she said. The State Department released a statement saying that the U.S. “regularly engages with other countries” on “the importance of preventing environmental destruction during armed conflict,” but added, “We do not comment on the details of our communications with foreign governments.” Mehta’s campaign is also part of a wider effort by activists who have been looking to the courts to force more aggressive action on climate change. As of July 1, 2020, at least 1,550 climate change cases have been filed in 38 countries,  . In 2015, a Dutch court ruled in the Urgenda Climate Case that the government had acted negligently by failing to take aggressive enough action to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the ruling in   in 2019 and ordered the government to hit specific emissions reductions targets, sparking a series of similar lawsuits in other countries. In one of those lawsuits, a Paris administrative court  for failing to meet its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling relied, in part, on France’s nonbinding commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, taking what had been the soft pledge of politics and turning it into a legally binding commitment. Mehta has framed an ecocide law as a counterweight to the failings of the Paris Agreement, saying in   that it offers “a way to correct the shortcomings” of the global climate pact. “Whereas Paris lacks sufficient ambition, transparency and accountability, the criminalization of ecocide would be an enforceable deterrent.” Alex Whiting, a professor at Harvard Law School and former coordinator of prosecutions at the International Criminal Court, said that making ecocide a crime before the court would have tremendous impact, even if only a few cases were actually prosecuted. “When a crime becomes an international crime, it has a ripple effect,” he said. “The environment is the issue of our time. Being able to do something about that seems important.” In Vanuatu, though, there is a sense that the pace of climate change is beginning to outrun the country’s ability to adapt. Cyclones that have devastated the islands are expected to intensify as the globe continues to warm. Missack, the Vanuatu diplomat, said the effects of climate change run much deeper than damage from storms. Most of the country’s residents depend on the crops they grow and the fish they catch, so their lives are intertwined with the environment around them. Recently, the harvest of yam, a key crop that is  , was disrupted, throwing it out of alignment with the seasonal and celestial markers and accompanying rituals that normally tell farmers when to reap. “One day we will talk about the stars, and this is how the ritual goes. But it will never be the same spirit, the same soul of the ritual,” Missack said. “And that loss, none of the money in this world can pay for it.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_13/3461066/210331-ecocides-main-cover-cs_2ebc05549a4dd05c1b18fcee33fee8aa.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Photo illustration of Deepwater Horizon, Amazon fires, city pollution, ocean oil spill and refinery exhaust.\" height=\"1250\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162848", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "65129", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asianage.com:443", "section": "india", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/110421/delhi-announces-curbs-on-social-religious-sports-political-cultural-academic-activities.html", "title": null, "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Restaurants, bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity", "text": "In view of rising Covid-19 cases, Delhi government Saturday announced a slew of curbs on social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious activities, while Maharashtra seemed all set for a harsher and longer lockdown, the date and time for which is yet to be finalised. An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.  Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors.   In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.  The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing.   “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said. Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday. In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm.   Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162847", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17750", "source": "scrapy"},

The Central forces gunned down four persons at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar. Another death also happened in the morning. From the very first day I have been vocal. Central forces are not my enemy. But the way it killed four voters standing in the queue only proved the Union home minister's conspiracy that has been on. Mr Shah, you must resign as you are the conspirator.\"   She alleged, \"After killing so many people, the BJP now claims the firing was in self-defence. They must hang themselves in shame! Where did they get so much audacity from? Where do so many atrocities originate from? BJP knows it has lost in the polls. That is why they are killing the voters and workers. What fault did they commit?\" Puncturing the Trinamul Congress supremo's claim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was also in the state for poll campaign in two districts, referred to Ms Banerjee's alleged provocation to attack the Central forces and warned her and her party workers against hooliganism. He mourned the loss of lives and urged the Election Commission for strong punishment for the accused of the killings.   Addressing a BJP rally in Siliguri of North Bengal, Mr Modi said, \"What happened in Coochbehar is very sad. I mourn the loss of lives in the killings. My condolences with their families. Didi and her goons have been panicked to see the support of the people for the BJP. Seeing herself losing the chair, Didi has stooped to such a low level! But I want to make it clear to the TMC, Didi and her goons that their muscle-flexing will not be allowed in Bengal. I request the Election Commission to take stringent action on the accused of the incident.\" He however told Ms Banerjee, \"But your tricks to provoke the people in attacking the Central forces on poll-duty and obstruct the polling process will not be able to save you. Your violence after a decade-long misdeed cannot save you. People are casting their votes in large numbers for BJP. North Bengal has shown it.\"    Standing by the Central forces for their role in the poll duty, Mr Modi observed that the TMC chief, not the forces, has become the biggest trouble in the polls.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162848", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16895", "source": "scrapy"},

The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer   on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said.   The US Navy said it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state.   The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.”   The MEA added: “The   was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile, the US Seventh Fleet said: “  (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”   It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162848", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17364", "source": "scrapy"},

Both incidents took place in Cooch Behar of North Bengal, the BJP’s stronghold. The Election Commission said that the CISF had to fire in order to save lives of voters who came to vote, put in place certain restrictions, including extending the \"silence period\" from 48 hours to 72 hours for the fifth phase of polling West Bengal. It also barred the entry of politicians in Cooch Behar district for the next 72 hours to prevent any possible law and order flare-up.   The shocking incident took place at around 10.30 am when a group of TMC workers stormed a polling booth (No. 126) at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra in Shitalkuchi Assembly constituency. Facing their attack, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) troopers, who were guarding the booth, fired on the mob and shot dead four persons — Hamidul Haque, Monirul Haque, Samiul Mian and Amjad Hossain — while injuring three others.  According to the CISF, the mob of around 150 first manhandled the polling staff at the booth. Sources said they were not “armed”, but some were carrying bamboo sticks. \"The CISF booth commander tried to pacify the miscreants but the mob entered the polling booth and beat up the other polling staff on duty. Few miscreants tried to snatch the weapons of CISF personnel deployed there. As a result, CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air but the mob did not pay any heed to the warning. In the meantime, a quick response team of the CISF and police also reached the spot. The mob further started advancing aggressively towards CISF personnel. Therefore, sensing imminent danger to their life, they fired seven more rounds towards the advancing mob of miscreants. While the above incident was going on, more police parties also arrived at the booth. It is reported that in self-defence they have also fired a few rounds,\" the CISF said.   Polling was stopped immediately by the EC.  The CISF's justification of \"self-defence\" was supported by the district police and administration in its preliminary report to the EC which, issuing the CISF a clean chit later, said, \"Recourse to open fire by CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save lives of voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as mob had attempted to snatch their weapons.\" The TMC, however, described the shooting as “cold-blooded murder\" of its workers in its complaint to Chief Electoral Officer West Bengal Ariz Aftab. Spewing venom against the Central forces and Union home minister Amit Shah, an angry chief minister flew to Siliguri and announced that the Criminal Investigation Department would probe the killings.    The TMC chief is likely to visit the kin of the deceased on Sunday though the EC has banned the entry of any politician of any level in Shitalkuchi.  The tragic incident follows party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee's recent statements that the Central forces were acting in a biased manner at the behest of the BJP and asking voters to gherao them. On Saturday, her party landed in the dock after its workers shot dead a first-time voter, Ananda Burman (18), in the same district. The teenaged boy was standing in a queue outside a polling booth (No. 285) at Pathantuli Shalbari area when a scuffle broke out between TMC and BJP workers. Another person, close to him, also suffered bullet injuries.   Despite the poll-violence, the 44 seats spread across five districts of West Bengal recorded a voters' turnout of 76.16 per cent on average till 5 pm. While Cooch Behar saw 79.73 per cent polling in nine seats, the figure stood at 73.65 per cent in five of Alipurduar seats, 75.49 per cent in 11 seats of South 24 Parganas, 75.03 per cent in nine seats in Howrah and 76.02 per cent in 10 Hooghly seats.  Updated data is expected from the Election Commission on Sunday. Among the 11 seats in South 24 Parganas, five -- Jadavpur, Kasba, Tollygunge, Behala East and Behala West -- are actually located in Kolkata.  The Election Commission’s order said that in Cooch Behar, comprising nine Assembly constituencies where voting got over on Saturday, no political leader from any national, state or other party should be allowed to enter the geographical boundaries of the district for the next 72 hours.   \"The Election Commission of India further directs that the silence period for phase 5 (i.e. for polls scheduled on April 17) shall be extended to 72 hours and no campaigning shall be permitted during 72 hours before the close of the poll in order to ensure the conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections,\" an EC order said. The silence period is generally for 48 hours.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162848", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17996", "source": "scrapy"},

Virgin also said it was shifting some of its orders of 737 MAX 8s to Max 10s while keeping the total at 48 planes. The Virgin announcement comes as Boeing executives faced several shareholder challenges Monday at its annual general meeting, with the crisis raising questions about whether the aerospace giant put profits ahead of safety to market a new narrow-body plane.

In yet another major development in the rape case against ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath, the victim has written to Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Police Commissioner alleging failure by the police to arrest him.  The letter written by the victim and addressed to Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava and Home Minister Amit Shah also questioned why the prosecution had failed to demand his presence at the time of filing an anticipatory bail application by the accused.  “This shocking degree of insensitivity towards my case is deeply distressing, and also makes me understand the true reason as to why so many rape victims in our country choose to suffer in silence, rather than to seek justice against their perpetrators,” said the victim in her letter, a copy of which is accessed by India Legal. The letter comes two days after the Delhi High Court granted interim protection from arrest to ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath in a case registered against him under charges of rape. A single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta on April 9 granted the relief, however, she clarified that the same would only be provided if Hiremath joins the investigation. Mumbai-based ET Now Anchor Varun Hiremath has been accused of raping a 22-year-old Pune-based woman in New Delhi. The journalist was anticipating arrest in connection with the FIR lodged by the woman in Chanakyapuri Police station under sec. 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint, the woman had alleged that she was raped by Hiremath in ITC Maurya Hotel in Chanakyapuri. However, Hiremath denied the allegation as false and frivolous as the FIR was registered after a delay of 3 days i.e on 23rd February 2021. Thereafter, Hiremath moved the Bombay High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail which was rejected last month. While rejecting the plea, Justice P.D. Naik observed that the applicant is charged under Section 376 of IPC, hence, the court is not inclined to grant such relief in this case. However, the applicant may approach the appropriate court, the Judge had said. Later, a Delhi court had also refused the anticipatory bail application of Hiremath, while observing that if the woman states in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent. The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Khanagwal.  \n \n \n   \n \n", "image_url": "<img width=\"694\" height=\"503\" class=\"entry-thumb\" src=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1.jpg 694w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-300x217.jpg 300w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-579x420.jpg 579w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-324x235.jpg 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" alt=\"\" title=\"Varun-Hiremath\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162843", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

In yet another major development in the rape case against ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath, the victim has written to Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Police Commissioner alleging failure by the police to arrest him.  The letter written by the victim and addressed to Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava and Home Minister Amit Shah also questioned why the prosecution had failed to demand his presence at the time of filing an anticipatory bail application by the accused.  “This shocking degree of insensitivity towards my case is deeply distressing, and also makes me understand the true reason as to why so many rape victims in our country choose to suffer in silence, rather than to seek justice against their perpetrators,” said the victim in her letter, a copy of which is accessed by India Legal. The letter comes two days after the Delhi High Court granted interim protection from arrest to ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath in a case registered against him under charges of rape. A single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta on April 9 granted the relief, however, she clarified that the same would only be provided if Hiremath joins the investigation. Mumbai-based ET Now Anchor Varun Hiremath has been accused of raping a 22-year-old Pune-based woman in New Delhi. The journalist was anticipating arrest in connection with the FIR lodged by the woman in Chanakyapuri Police station under sec. 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint, the woman had alleged that she was raped by Hiremath in ITC Maurya Hotel in Chanakyapuri. However, Hiremath denied the allegation as false and frivolous as the FIR was registered after a delay of 3 days i.e on 23rd February 2021. Thereafter, Hiremath moved the Bombay High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail which was rejected last month. While rejecting the plea, Justice P.D. Naik observed that the applicant is charged under Section 376 of IPC, hence, the court is not inclined to grant such relief in this case. However, the applicant may approach the appropriate court, the Judge had said. Later, a Delhi court had also refused the anticipatory bail application of Hiremath, while observing that if the woman states in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent. The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Khanagwal.  \n \n \n   \n \n", "image_url": "<img width=\"694\" height=\"503\" class=\"entry-thumb\" src=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1.jpg 694w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-300x217.jpg 300w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-579x420.jpg 579w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-324x235.jpg 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" alt=\"\" title=\"Varun-Hiremath\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162854", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Two years ago, I had the honour of interacting with him personally at a well-attended conclave of prominent judges and eminent members of the legal profession discussing the Insolvency and Banktuptcy Code, (IBC) a major reform measure.  At a professional level, his reasoning, analytical abilities, depth of knowledge and presentation skills in handling a highly specialised and complex subject were unbeatable. At a personal level, I found him ruminative, soft-spoken, courtly and conscientious but, most of all, infectiously humble.  He has chaired several committees related to the IBC law, a commendable initiative that has helped India leapfrog ahead in the list of countries known for the ease of doing business.  In fact, IBC has changed the whole thought process in the insolvency sector. The entire thrust of IBC is in the revival of sick businesses. Such is the impact of IBC today that there is hardly a day where developments related to it do not get reported in the press, either local or national. In addition to his unique expertise on specific subjects, Justice Ramana, during his long tenure as a judge of the Supreme Court, has been party to numerous judgments. Notable judgments include:   (2019), dealing with the Right to Information Act, 2005,   (2020) and  ’s case which held that compensation for housewives must depend on the work being performed by them, therefore granting dignity to women who are homemakers.  The judgments in   and   have paved the way for flexibility of appointments to tribunals and the autonomy and freedom of state governments to design their own fiscal legislation respectively. Our curtain-raiser story in last week’s issue, described Justice Ramana  as a “kind, considerate and soft-spoken judge, who is eager to do justice and give counsel appearing before him a patient hearing with an open mind. His vast experience of being a judge for some 20 years, eight of which have been acquired in the apex court, will come to his aid in a remarkable way”. We also pointed out that his understanding of the higher judiciary as the chief justice of the Delhi High Court and acting chief justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court provided him great perspective while carrying out his duties as the fountainhead and paterfamilias of the judiciary. His tenure as a government counsel for various departments and as an additional advocate general have given him a deep understanding of the functioning of government departments, bringing to fore his expertise in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters. His humble beginnings, our article noted last week:   “have given him an insight into the suffering of the common man, which has also made him a champion of civil liberties from the very beginning of his college days and later as a journalist. He has great empathy for those requiring protection of human rights. His tenure, no doubt, will be marked by compassion, expertise and wisdom”. As the head of one of the three pillars of the State, it becomes the responsibility of the CJI to ensure that reformation and transformation continue faster than ever. The disposal rate of cases across the country must move ahead at least twice the speed with which matters get filed. The functioning of all the tiers of the courts and the tribunals are matters of great concern and requires the attention of the CJI. We wish him a happy journey ahead. \n \n \n   \n \n", "image_url": "<img width=\"1068\" height=\"601\" class=\"entry-thumb\" src=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1068x601.jpg\" srcset=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-696x392.jpg 696w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-747x420.jpg 747w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1068px) 100vw, 1068px\" alt=\"CJI Ramana\" title=\"CJI Ramana\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162854", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The decision to rollback was taken hours after the government announced the steepest cut in the rate on small savings schemes on Wednesday. The government, however, said the rate cuts are in line with the overall interest rate movement in the financial system.   Sources said that the government's surprise rollback decision on small savings schemes is an attempt by the BJP to contain the fallout of the decision hitting the common man in the ongoing elections in West Bengal, Assam and other states. The “surprising move” to roll back the cut in rates was announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in an early morning tweet on Thursday. \"Interest rates of small savings schemes of GoI shall continue to be at the rates which existed in the last quarter of 2020-2021, ie. rates that prevailed as of March 2021. Orders issued by oversight shall be withdrawn. This has the approval of competent authority,\" she said.   Taking a dig at the finance minister, the Congress said one can imagine the functioning of the economy when such a duly approved order affecting crores of people can be issued by an \"oversight\". The ministry of finance had, on Wednesday, announced a cut in small savings deposit rate from 4 per cent to 3.5 per cent for the first quarter of the financial year starting April 1, 2021. Giving a blow to small savings depositors, the Centre had slashed interest rates on post office deposits, public provident fund and others by up to 1.1 per cent or 110 basis points. As far as the implications of small savings schemes to the common man are concerned, the most popular fixed income products like Public Provident Fund (PPF) was to fetch a rate of 6.4 per cent, down from 7.1 per cent earlier. Similarly, National Savings Certificate (NSC) was to yield 5.9 per cent, down from 6.8 per cent earlier, while rates on the girl child savings scheme Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana would fall to 6.9 per cent from 7.6 per cent earlier. One-year time deposit rates had seen the steepest cut of 110 basis points to 4.4 per cent from 5.5 per cent.   Interest rates for small savings schemes are notified on a quarterly basis. However, Wednesday's decision to cut interest rate by up to 1.1 per cent across various small savings schemes, including the NSC and PPF, came a day before the second phase of polling in West Bengal, including the political hotbed Nandigram, from where West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162853", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16627", "source": "scrapy"},

According to a Greenpeace Southeast Asia analysis of IQAir data, 1800 deaths per million were estimated due to PM2.5 air pollution in Delhi.   \"The PM2.5 air pollution claimed approximately 54,000 lives in India's national capital in 2020,\" the study said. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Exposure to PM2.5 is considered the most important environmental risk factor for deaths globally, and was attributed to 4.2 million premature deaths in 2015, the study said. The study noted that the damage is equally worrying in other Indian cities. \"An estimated 25,000 avoidable deaths in Mumbai in 2020 have been attributed to air pollution. Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Lucknow estimated an approximate 12000, 11000, 11000, and 6700 avoidable deaths respectively due to polluted air,\" it said   Noting that the air pollutant levels in Delhi remained almost six times above the prescribed WHO limits of 10 µg/m3 annual mean, the study said the estimated air pollution-related economic losses were USD 8.1 billion (Rs 58,895 crore), which amounts to 13 per cent of Delhi's annual GDP. \"Despite a temporary reprieve in air quality owing to the lockdown, the latest figures from the report underscore the need to act immediately. The need of the hour is to rapidly scale up renewable energy, bring an end to fossil fuel emissions and boost sustainable and accessible transport systems,\" the study said. Globally, approximate 160,000 deaths have been attributed to PM2.5 air pollution in the five most populous cities of Delhi (30 million), Mexico City (22 million), Sao Paulo (22 million), Shanghai (26 million) and Tokyo (37 million), it said.   Despite recording relatively better air quality this year due to strict lockdown, air pollution continues to be a serious public health issue which also drastically impacts our economy. For the governments of the day, it is crucial that investments are made towards green and sustainable solutions. When we choose fossil fuel over clean energy, our health is put at stake. Polluted air increases the likelihood of deaths due to cancer & stroke, spike in asthma attacks and worsens severity of COVID-19 symptoms, said Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India.   \"We need to ensure our growth demand is fuelled by sustainable and cleaner sources of energy and cities should promote low cost , active and carbon-neutral transport options that prioritises walking, cycling, and public transport, the increased use of clean energy and clean transport will not only improve the public health but it will also strengthen the economy and public money\" added Chanchal.   Commenting on the revelations made by cost estimator CEO of IQAir, Frank Hammes says, Breathing should not be deadly. The fact that poor air quality claimed an estimated 160,000 lives in the five largest cities alone should give us pause, especially in a year when many cities were seeing lower air pollution levels due to less economic activity. Governments, corporations and individuals must do more to eliminate the sources of air pollution and make our cities better places to live. To show the impact of air pollution related deaths on the economy, Greenpeace said it used the approach called willingness-to-pay which means a lost life year or a year lived with disability is converted to money by the amount that people are willing to pay in order to avoid this negative outcome.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162854", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17045", "source": "scrapy"},

Delta first started blocking middle seats and limiting capacity on smaller planes in April near the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other airlines had similar policies, including Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines, but they have since gone back to selling all seats. Physically distancing from other passengers is extremely difficult on an airplane. Delta and other carriers have repeatedly said filtration systems and intense cleaning make it unlikely that travelers will catch Covid-19 on a plane. But Delta said many travelers choose Delta over other airlines because it kept its policy in place. CEO Ed Bastian said in announcement that 65% of customers who flew Delta in 2019 said they expect to have at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by May 1 and that that is “giving us the assurance to offer customers the ability to choose any seat on our aircraft, while also introducing new services, products and rewards to support the journey.” The change comes just as what an improved summer travel season approaches. Generally the most lucrative time of year, airlines suffered as many potential customers stayed home last year. But with vaccines rolling out across the country, airline executives are upbeat about an increase in bookings for late spring and summer trips. Delta announced a host of other changes aimed to drum up revenue. Tickets valid until the end of this year as well as all tickets purchased this year would be valid until the end of 2022. Delta also said its customers can earn as much as 75% more to get to Medallion Status. The carrier and its rivals’ frequent flyer programs have become more important during the pandemic. These programs make money by selling miles to banks, which customers earn when they use rewards credit cards. Delta last year raised a then-record $9 billion in debt backed by its SkyMiles program. The carrier is also bringing back snacks on board on April 14 and in early June it will offer hot meals in its Delta One or first class cabins on some transcontinental flights. Boxed meals will be offered on some other domestic routes for first class in July.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_13/3461052/210331-delta-seats-mb-1532_8155a8100fce8204f59231e359b2e172.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"View of the cabin of a Delta flight between Minneapolis and Baltimore on April 25, 2020.\" height=\"2448\" width=\"3264\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162853", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "38797", "source": "scrapy"},

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162847", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16252", "source": "scrapy"},

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday.   In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm. Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162854", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18003", "source": "scrapy"},

Diwali, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Eid, Christmas, and Kumbh Mela, the mother of all festivals, are clearly not enough. We probably have the most literary festivals in the world. Other countries have run-of-the-mill elections. India,   and   has a “festival of democracy” Therefore it’s hardly surprising that in the middle of the second wave of   , the prime minister wants the good citizens of India to have themselves a   or a vaccination festival. In his speech, Narendra Modi suggested that a   between 11 and 14 April could boost the vaccination drive. Also, 11 April happens to be the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotiba Phule while 14 April is that of Babasaheb Ambedkar. This could be some strategist’s brainwave of killing two birds with one jab. One year ago as India went into lockdown the prime minister had other festive ideas to raise our spirits - we clanged pots and pans, blew conch shells, lit divas. There were even WhatsApp forwards about how that vibration was going to destroy the virus. One year later the virus is rampaging through the country in its second wave, those WhatsApp forwarders have move on to other causes and we have upped the game from pots and pans and candles to a full-fledged festival. Cynics might roll their eyes but the prime minister knows that as soon as it’s called a festival it becomes a red-letter day in our minds. Amazon and Flipkart can do “Tika Utsav” bumper sales starting on 12:01 am on 11 April until 11:59 pm on 14 April. Pizza Hut can deliver Tika Utsav special pizzas - with tika kebab toppings of course. Each city can have friendly contests to see which centre doles out the most shots in one day, that’s vaccine shots, not alcoholic ones. Anything that encourages vaccination is of course something to be encouraged. And the prime minister is in his own way a cheerleader-in-chief for the nation. Thus he is to be commended for trying to encourage all eligible Indians to go out and get vaccinated. And if some upbeat festival messaging works better than doom-and-gloom portents so be it. Of course, there is a danger that in the rush to celebrate tika utsavs, we could crowd vaccination centres and forget about social distancing but that’s a minor quibble. But what feels incongruous is this cheery PSA for a “festival of vaccination” occurs at the same time as a “festival of democracy” is unfolding in so many states across India. The pandemic and the election seem to be occurring in different worlds, hermetically sealed from each other. There are two Indias, one in which a   second wave is raging and one in which elections are happening and apparently never the twain shall meet. Mind you this is a country where a court rules that you can be fined for not wearing your mask while alone in your car. A vehicle is a “public place” says the Delhi High Court but a political rally is obviously not. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan recently scolded his fellow citizens for letting down their guard and allowing the Covid numbers to explode afresh. He blamed “lack of commitment and sincerity” and said, “nobody is interested in wearing the mask.. there’s no respect for the norms of physical distancing.” , the same minister shared pictures of his party leaders holding election rallies where hardly anyone was wearing a mask and there was certainly no physical distancing happening. “One look at Harsh Vardhan’s Twitter feed makes it quite clear who could be called out “for taking everything casually’” writes Rohan Venkataramakrishnan in  . It’s not a BJP problem. It’s a problem pretty much across the political spectrum. Old habits die hard. Old electioneering habits die especially hard. Photographs from rallies across Bengal for example, whether Trinamool or BJP or the Left Front-Congress combine, would hardly suggest the country is grappling with a pandemic. It looks just like something from five years ago. Perhaps the fact that the Bihar elections did not cause a huge explosion in infections lulled us into a false sense of complacency. But these elections are happening in the middle of a certified second wave. Yet the same politicians who wag their fingers at the public for giving safety precautions a “tilanjali” seem to have no interest in leading by example. And they do not even see the jarring dissonance. It is obviously not easy in a country like India to do physical distancing at the best of times, let alone at election time. But we can do our bit. The symbolism matters. Though Donald Trump sneered at Joe Biden for wearing a mask during his campaign, Biden resolutely stuck to it. The open-air inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with the guests wearing masks sent out two messages - one, that the business of democracy and transition of power must go one and two, they must go on with as much safety precautions as possible in these grave times. It was about fortitude in face of a pandemic not the denial of it. It will never be foolproof but the message is important. The visual of masked politicians on stage at an election rally in India would send out a message as well. A top political leader taking his mask off to address the rally and then putting it back on would send out a message. Similarly, a crowded stage filled with maskless jostling politicians sends out its own message to the rank and file. A political candidate in Kolkata told reporters asking him about lack of masks and safety norms that he was “not afraid” of the virus and he would win, Covid or no Covid. Tirath Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand tells devotees planning to attend Mahakumbh that “nobody will be stopped in the name of   ” because “faith is stronger than fear”. Two days later he tested positive. At this point it’s baffling that politicians still think bravado is the vaccine we all need. Now the Haridwar district magistrate has said all schools in the district will remain closed from 9 to 15 April not because of   fears but “in view of a huge rush of devotees to Kumbh Mela.”    It’s clear that after a year everyone is suffering from Covid safety exhaustion. The masks are slipping and weddings and parties are back and public transport is crowded. We read about rising numbers and lack of beds but there’s no indication that it’s affecting our behaviour. A video of a cheerful woman at a temple during Holi telling a reporter there was no Covid there recently went viral. Despite Yogi Adityanath’s strongman reputation in Uttar Pradesh, his exhortation to maintain safety protocols during Holi seemed to fall on many deaf ears. People are tired of a year of safety protocols or lulled by the dip in numbers at the end of 2020 or both. But now that the second wave has truly landed, mixed messages from the political leaders do not help. While the PM exhorts us to not let down our guard, we just hear \"no lockdown\". The prime minister in his message about the second wave has reiterated the focus needs to be on “test, track, treat, Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid management”. That’s commendable. But perhaps the time has come for politicians of all parties, not just the aam aadmi, to also exhibit that “Covid-appropriate behaviour”. And if we must turn everything into a festival, what about a month-long “mask festival” instead of just a tika one?", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" alt=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tamil-nadu-election_BJP_PTI_640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162855", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Allen said the group is looking for GM to sign a $200 million-a-year deal for all Black media, growing annually by 5 percent over the next 10 years. “Mary Barra has the opportunity to be on the right side of history,” Allen told NBC News. He declined to say what the executives might do if GM does not offer an acceptable deal. Allen acknowledged that, by calling out America’s largest automaker, the group hopes to subsequently leverage any agreement to reach deals elsewhere. “Every corporation in America will be held accountable if they don’t do business with Black media in a respectable way,” he said. Morrissey said GM already spends “significantly” more than 0.5 percent with Black-owned media. \"With respect specifically to Black-owned media we increased our spend by 100 percent from 2020 to 2021, and we plan to grow from there. We will continue our efforts,\" he said. \"We are disappointed that Mr. Allen and his fellow signatories resorted to additional paid media advertising to advance a narrative of factual inaccuracies and character assault against our CEO, Mary Barra.\" \"It is particularly perplexing given that the paid advertising appears after the GM team has had repeated meetings with Mr. Allen and his team, and after we had scheduled a meeting between the signatories and Ms. Barra,\" Morrissey said. Benjamin Chavis, CEO and president of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, a trade group for Black media, said GM and Barra are \"taking steps to deal with systemic racism — but it doesn’t happen overnight, or in one year.\" He cautioned that systemic racism remains a major problem and, as much as GM has done, the automaker “and other corporations need to increase their advertising with Black-owned media.” Since becoming GM CEO in January 2015, Barra has declared a goal of creating “the most inclusive company in the world.\" Last week the company appointed two new members to its board of directors: former Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman and Mark Tatum, the deputy commissioner and COO of the National Basketball Association. After the death of George Floyd in police custody last May, Barra wrote a letter to employees saying that she was “impatient and disgusted” by the events and stressed the need to “individually and collectively” act. Last June 19 — known as Juneteenth, the commemoration of the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States — GM asked employees to observe 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the amount of time Chauvin is recorded as having his knee on Floyd's neck during his fatal arrest, as a sign of solidarity with the black community. (Prosecutors at Chauvin's murder trial in Minneapolis this week have said it was actually 9 minutes and 46 seconds.) But the newspaper ads said these moves didn't go far enough to create material change. “You stand on stage, after the death of George Floyd, saying, ‘Black Lives Matter,’ when you have refused to acknowledge us,” the ad says of Barra. “The very definition of systemic racism is when you are ignored, excluded and you don’t have true economic inclusion.” Barra declined a request for comment.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162854", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "41418", "source": "scrapy"},

Owaisi, who after AIMIM's good show in the 2020 Bihar assembly poll has announced that it will contest the Bengal election, has been discussing a possible alliance with Furfura Sharif cleric Abbas Siddiqui, who had recently floated the Indian Secular Front (ISF). \"This will be our party supremo Assaduddin Owaisi's first rally in the state in this poll season. He will kick off our party's poll campaign in the state,\" AIMIM state secretary Zameerul Hasan said. The Metiabruz seat in the city is minority-dominated and falls in Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency which is represented by Abhishek Banerjee, the nephew of TMC supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. AIMIM has already come up with posters and the slogan 'Awaz uthaneke waqt aa chuka hain (time has come to raise your voice)'.   Owaisi's proposed rally has evoked sharp reactions from the ruling TMC. \"The AIMIM is nothing but a proxy of BJP. Owaisi is well aware that Muslims here are mostly Bengali-speaking and won't support him. In Bengal, Muslims stand firmly with Mamata Banerjee,\" senior TMC leader Sougata Roy asserted. Owaisi had visited West Bengal on January 3 to meet Siddiqui and had said the ruling TMC should introspect and find out what worked in BJP's favour in the state during the 2019 Lok Sabha election in which it won 18 of the 42 seats. \r\n\"TMC should analyse why its members were leaving,\" he had said. Prominent Muslim leaders in West Bengal have claimed that the parties are apprehensive that political equations in the polarised state are set to witness significant changes as the sway of non-BJP parties over minorities appears to be set for a stiff challenge with the entry of All India Majlis-e- Ittehadul Muslimeen in the poll scene.   According to a senior leader of the Hyderabad-based party, Owaisi has seen in West Bengal a fertile ground for his expansion plans as Muslims constitute around 30 per cent of the state's population. Of the 30 per cent at least 24 per cent are Bengali- speaking.

Mumbai is divided into 12 police zones and the city police are authorised to collect a fine of Rs 200 from people not wearing masks, as mandated under COVID-19 norms.   To prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the metropolis, Singh has asked the city police force to take strict action against those not wearing masks in public places, the official said. He said Singh recently asked all senior inspectors to improve the performance of their respective police stations and achieve the zonal target of 1,000 such cases per day. The Mumbai police are making efforts to increase the awareness among citizens about containing the spread of COVID-19, city police spokesperson S Chaitanya said. \"The idea behind setting the target of 1,000 cases for each zone per day is to sensitise people about following guidelines issued by the government about wearing mask and maintaining physical distance in public places,\" he said.   The official said 50 per cent of the fine collected from mask rule violators will be used for police welfare activities and the remaining amount will be given to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

This is when the art connoisseur decided to collaborate with Kamruzzaman Shadhin, Gidree Bawlee Foundation of Arts, to launch 'Bhumi' (Earth), a project to support creative communities of the Thakurgaon district during the COVID-19 crisis. \"I had to start somewhere, and Thakurgaon seemed to be the right place to begin such a mega-scale project, since there are hundreds of traditional craftsmen out there, especially from indigenous communities such as Santals, Rajbongshi and others who were looking for support,\" Durjoy elaborated. This project catered to around 60 families with more than 250 members. The four–month long project had been developed meticulously to tackle the preliminary stages of the economic downturn faced by the resident communities, an after-effect of the sprawling pandemic. \"We planned on the project to help the community of artisans 'up-north' and make their craftsmanship identified and celebrated, to the entire nation. But somehow, luckily, our works surpassed the boundaries and became a worldwide sensation, with popular news outlet CNN featuring our story to the global audience,\" said Durjoy. And true it was, the drone shots of the seed bed by renowned nature photographer, Firoz Al Sabah made several rounds on social media, with praises pouring in from all corners of the world for the remarkable flair of the agricultural farmers. The project also highlighted the works of the jute artisans for their innovative scarecrow construction, the bamboo artisans, the distinctive fabric weavers, and the satranji (handcrafted rug) weavers of the district. \"We took the virgin (never-been-farmed) land on lease, to grow vegetables on a designed seedbed, with 'zero use' of modern-day technology or any sort of harmful pesticides. The seedbed had been shaped in the form of a buffalo and then when we took a drone shot, it turned out to be a huge sensation, with incredible representation of the ancient farming methodologies. My personal feeling is that I have been associated with a huge number of artists over the years, but Bhumi educated me in ways that are beyond comprehension. And I am glad to have been associated with such an auspicious project from the planning stage.\" \"I also want people at large to know that DBF (Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation) does not believe in abandoning a community after a project work is completed; we keep regular contact with the artisans associated with Bhumi till date, and help them through every means possible, whenever necessary,\" he said. Inquired about the future prospects of similar projects, Durjoy revealed that he always wants DBF to be associated with similarly industrious and inspiring projects. \"Art is existent everywhere, in every form in every place and bringing that art to the forefront is our duty. DBF wants to inspire people. My dream is to establish DBF as a platform, where young, rising artists with impeccable talents can come and connect with ease. We are here to represent Bangladesh in its truest form, from the peripheries to the urban cities,\" said Durjoy. At the end of our rendezvous with Durjoy Rahman, we had one question placed in front of him. How do you want people to remember DBF in the long term? \"Just as an institution that is trying hard to make an impact on human lives via art and culture,\" reflected the art connoisseur.   \n", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-6\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/2021/04/05/bhumi1.jpg?itok=hWHbX2Fv&amp;c=34d037ab4a8a63c00c275b64f7375152\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162644", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17907", "source": "scrapy"},

Taking a giant step for diversity, the Biden-Harris Administration seeks to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. On Friday the administration submitted US President Joe Biden's priorities for 2022 discretionary spending to Congress. \"This goal aligns with President Biden's commitment to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all,\" said acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk.  While the first cadre of astronauts for the Artemis program was announced in December, the first two crew members for Artemis III in 2024 have yet to be announced. The initial group of 18 represents a diverse team of astronauts, including those new to NASA and veterans of spaceflight. The Artemis astronauts also include Indian American Raja Chari. \"These are historic moments in advancing equity for all of mankind,\" said Bhavya Lal, acting NASA chief of staff. She added that the announcement is personally \"very meaningful\" to her. Lal came to the US at 18 years old, carrying two suitcases full of books and never imagining she would work at NASA in the future. \"If you can see it, you can believe it,\" she said in a tweet. Returning astronauts to the moon will act as a proving ground before sending them on to Mars, a long-term goal of the Artemis program.  When astronauts explore the lunar south pole, which has never been visited by humans before, they will build on the legacy and science gained during the Apollo program and carry it into a new century.In a statement released by , the proposed spending also calls for an increase of more than 6 percent than the previous year.  \"This USD 24.7 billion funding request demonstrates the Biden Administration's commitment to NASA and its partners who have worked so hard this past year under difficult circumstances and achieved unprecedented success,\" Jurczyk said.  \"The President's discretionary request Strengthens NASA's ability to better understand Earth and how it works as an integrated system, from our oceans to our atmosphere, how it all impacts our daily lives, and how it all is impacted by climate change,\" he added. In addition to aiding the Artemis program and studying climate change, the President's request would also help further the agency's robotic exploration of space, provide a boost to aviation technology and provide new funding for NASA's efforts to engage in STEM outreach for underserved students, according to the agency. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162848", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "33743", "source": "scrapy"},

Topline results from an efficacy analysis on 12 to 15-year-old participants through cases accrued by March 31, 2021, from the Phase 3 trial were recently announced. In this analysis, the companies said that its vaccine \"was well tolerated with side effects generally consistent with those observed in participants 16 to 25 years of age.\" It also stated that all participants in the trial will continue to be monitored for long-term protection and safety for an additional two years after their second dose. Pfizer and BioNTech previously said they would file for emergency use authorization as soon as possible, and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said he hoped to start vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds before the start of the next school year.

Djibo, a dusty town in northern  , has become a byword for suffering in this impoverished country's seven-year-old struggle with jihadism. More than 580 people have been killed since the insurgency spilled over from neighbouring Mali, according to an AFP tally. Attacks on emblems of the state, hit-and-run raids on remote villages and brutal interpretation of Islamic law have forced an estimated 300,000 people to flee their homes.  Among them is Boureima, head of a family of 43 people - seven men, 13 women, and 23 children. They abandoned their village Gassalpalik, 70 kilometres from Djibo, eventually washing up in Yagma, a village about 30 km north of the capital Ouagadougou. Belen said that he had spent his entire life in Djibo and had never even left the area until now - but \"when you are lost, you have to end up somewhere.\" In this alien landscape, the family has no friends or contacts. The head of the village has appointed a \"tutor\" to help the family, who are members of the Mossi ethnic group, get their bearings. \"The attackers took everything from us - cows, sheep, goats... They were armed and came on motorbikes,\" the patriarch recalled. \"They went into people's homes and took animals and killed the men. I saw people getting killed. Many of them,\" he said, adding he was unable to give any accurate figure. \"They also took three men from the village, and we have no news of their whereabouts\", he added. The attack happened despite patrols by the security forces, he said. \"I don't understand,\" he said. \"We don't know what they   want. The teachers fled. The health centre closed. We were afraid. The only way out was to flee.\" The family hurriedly bundled up its meagre possessions and the little money it had. \"Everyone in the village fled. It was a free-for-all... We don't know what has become of the village -- nobody lives there now, except perhaps for birds\", he said. He added: \"We have absolutely nothing here. We have swallowed our shame.... It's desperate.\" \r\n \r\nBintou, an older member of the group said that the family was at least able to sleep peacefully in their beds, but that was little consolation to what they had lost. \"Before the start (of the jihadist) attacks, we had a happy life, we grew crops, we lived in our own home, we had cattle and we were never hungry,\" she said. \"Here, we sweep stones\" to sell to construction sites, she said. \"We sell them at $1.68 a pile, but sometimes you have to wait three days before making a sale. We cannot feed the children\", she added. The family are living in homes which have been made available for free by the villagers, but it has no land - a crucial source of nutrition and income in a place where there is no work. Nabonswende Zongo, an elderly villager who has been appointed to help the family, said the situation was \"difficult.\" \"If there is peace, they will go back. I am happy to help them. We are all brothers. I hope to do what I can, but have no idea what the future holds.

The longer-term impact of the reopening boom won’t be known until years into the future, he said, because it will take time to ascertain the quality of government spending, including President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill. “Spent wisely, it will create more economic opportunity for everyone,” he said. Dimon, 65, weighed in on a range of topics familiar to watchers of the country’s most prominent banker: He promoted JPMorgan’s efforts to create economic opportunities for Americans who have been left behind, highlighted threats to U.S. banks’ dominance from fintech and Big Tech players, and opined on public policy and the role of corporations to help bring about change. While Dimon called stock market valuations “quite high,” he said that a multi-year boom may justify current levels, because markets are pricing in economic growth and excess savings that make their way into equities. While he is bullish for the economy’s immediate future, there are serious challenges ahead for the U.S., Dimon said. The country has been tested before, through conflicts starting with the Civil War, the Great Depression and the societal upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s, he said. “In each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors,” Dimon said. “This time may be different.” The past year highlighted challenges for U.S. institutions, elected officials and families, as rivals see a “nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality — and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals.” The country ultimately needs to “move beyond our differences and self-interest and act for the greater good,” Dimon said. “The good news is that this is fixable.” He also addressed inequality in the education system, \"terrible\" infrastructure and \"poorly designed\" social safety nets. \"It is hard to look at these issues in their totality and not conclude that they have a significant negative effect on the great American economic engine,\" Dimon said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3462671/210407-jamie-dimon-al-0755_eae68b742780e5dbd7e2d8a534fafa74.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Jamie Dimon\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162857", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "39732", "source": "scrapy"},

Ketchup has always been a staple condiment for Americans, but since the pandemic forced many restaurants to ramp up their takeout game, the demand for those handy individual packets quickly skyrocketed. And the rules of supply and demand have led to a 13 percent increase in ketchup packet prices since 2020, according to the newspaper. Fast-food chains have always handed out these disposable packets, but sit-down restaurants have traditionally placed bottles of ketchup on tables or poured it out into a bowl for customers. With both food service models now competing for packets, or sachets, as industry experts call them, the supply chain has been stretched to its limit. Kraft Heinz is, of course, the most well-known ketchup manufacturer, and the company makes up nearly 70 percent of the U.S. retail market for ketchup, The Wall Street Journal reported. With more people eating at home, ketchup bottle sales have also increased 15 percent in the last year, to over $1 billion in 2020. As a result of the supply chain shortage, many restaurants are limiting the number of packets they give to customers or resorting to purchasing generic ketchup brands they normally don't use. Some popular fast-food chains like Long John Silver's and   have even had to reach out to secondary suppliers for the packets. Steve Cornell, Kraft Heinz’s president of Enhancers, Specialty and Away from Home Business Unit, told  the company is working hard to keep up the demand for those coveted ketchup packets as the takeout industry continues to explode. “The unmatched consumer love for our iconic HEINZ brand as well as our longstanding partnership with the restaurant industry are two responsibilities we take very seriously – which was why we made strategic manufacturing investments at the start of the pandemic to keep up with the surge in demand for ketchup packets driven by the accelerated delivery and take-out trends,\" he wrote in an email statement. Cornell also noted that Kraft Heinz has been looking into new packaging options to help evolve with its industry. \"At the same time, we also fast-tracked future-focused culinary and packaging innovations, as well as further manufacturing expansion plans, as we believe there is an enormous opportunity to grow our brands in the exciting foodservice industry,” he said. Fans of the 150-year-old ketchup brand will recall that Kraft Heinz invented a single-serve ketchup tray called the   in 2011. In November 2020, the brand also launched a   to help offer restaurants a sanitary way to allow customers to dispense their own condiments. Looking ahead to the future, Cornell said the company is banking on its multiple new production lines, which he hopes will yield a 25 percent increase in production, amounting to 12 billion ketchup packets a year.

The team is preparing for the forthcoming IPL to be held from 09 April. As part of the protocol, the entire SRH team has been in quarantine and living in a bio bubble since March 28. Incidentally, the players have not been allowed to go out of their hotel rooms to even start practice until they tested negative for the third time too.   In an interaction with Deccan Chronicle, SRH’s mentor V.V.S. Laxman talks about how his players are upbeat and looking forward to an exciting tournament. “The boys just had a go at the nets and it’s been pretty good,” Laxman shares. “Most of the Indian players played domestic cricket (Vijay Hazare tourney) while the foreign players played for their respective national sides. So we are trying to capitalise this entire week for our practice sessions.” Even so, IPL for Laxman has always been such a tournament in which the players have to gel well as a team. “And the good thing is that we [SRH] always played well as a cohesive unit and that’s been our strength,” he states, adding, “In fact, we are one of the most consistent teams in the last few years.”   Having retained their core group for the 2021 season, SRH looks strong in batting with the likes of David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy, Kane Williamson, Manish Padey, etc. So too, Laxman is quite certain that SRH has the potential to beat any side. But added to the confidence in his team members’ performance is his assurance that the team has taken back lessons from IPL’s last season in Dubai. “I think overall it’s important to get a good quick breakthroughs. I believe winning crucial moments is significant,” he states. The franchise has, nevertheless, been criticised for depending heavily on the top order. But Laxman is undeterred by the talk and says that the team has players who can strengthen middle order too.   “This season players such as Kedar Jadhav will boost our depth in the batting; his experience will not only add diversity but also strike a balance in the line-up,” assures the former India cricketer. The batting great further revels in the fact that the team has got players who can perform in any conditions. None of his confidence in his team, however, means he is blinded to their weaknesses, the mark of a true mentor. “An area we need to work on is to maintain the positive frame of mind and attitude of the players when they are part of the bubble for a long time.”   Laxman is also convinced that as the players have been part of the bio bubble in the earlier series too, getting into the groove will not be so difficult. \r\nEven as the IPL time is being held in India this year, the Hyderabadi batsman is aware that the strategy for tourneys of such magnitude keeps changing. “Strategies change according to the situations, conditions, pitch, opposition, etc. But luckily we’ve got players who can execute strategies even in the toughest conditions. So winning the tournament is all about seizing the momentum early and sustaining it. And for this, players have to be consistent and tough — physically and mentally tough.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162857", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16913", "source": "scrapy"},

The initiative is called NinetyToZero, so named for the roughly 90 percent wealth gap between white and Black Americans. Its leaders describe the goal as providing a roadmap for organizations to “counteract centuries of discrimination, segregation, and financial exploitation,” according to the group’s launch plans announced Tuesday. “Every business has a responsibility — and can influence others — to advance racial equity, create opportunities for others and strengthen the communities it serves,” Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ CEO, said in a statement. “Starbucks believes in using our scale for good, and we will address the systemic barriers which keep Americans from reaching their full potential.” Organizations that join NinetyToZero agree to establish internal goals for hiring and promoting Black talent. They also pledge to calculate how much money is spent with Black-owned businesses and in Black-owned financial institutions. “Racial wealth inequity is a threat to child well-being and America’s future,” the Rev. Dr. Starsky Wilson, CEO of the Children’s Defense Fund, another inaugural member, said in a statement. “Institutions committed to the promise of Black children and families must push beyond public statements to concrete action to close the wealth gap.” According to the most recent Federal Reserve statistics available, white families have an average of $171,000 in net worth — including savings, investments and home ownership. For Black families, it’s $17,600. Economists say that closing the racial wealth gap would significantly benefit the nation as a whole. According to a McKinsey & Company report, wealth equity could raise U.S. GDP by $1.5 trillion within 10 years. “The key to narrowing the racial health gap is to narrow the racial wealth gap,” Michelle Williams, Dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which also joined the initiative, said in a statement. “The two go hand in hand, and we will all be the beneficiaries of a more equitable and just society.” Other companies are also working on the issue. United Airlines   that it will open its own flight academy to train 5,000 new pilots this decade, with plans for half of them to be women or people of color to increase diversity at the airline. The foundation Robin Hood, also a member, will incubate the initiative, which will accept other member organizations beyond the 10 inaugural groups announced Tuesday. Further research for new practices that can be used to reduce the racial wealth gap will come from another initiative member, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Also part of NinetyToZero’s inaugural class of organizations: The ACLU, Lord Abbett, McKinsey & Co., and SKDKnickerbocker. “Closing the racial wealth gap is more than a zero-sum game,” Robin Hood CEO Wes Moore said in a statement. “When Black families have economic security and agency, everyone benefits. Now is the time to be reflective, bold and transparent. And we urge and encourage companies and organizations across the country to join us and ensure Black Americans obtain equitable access to wealth, permanently transforming the country’s economic landscape for the better.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/rockcms/2021-04/855/210407-wes-moore-jm-1144-ef9dd6_8c496a30bdbf71d04e829057178dad9b8de76319.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Wes Moore, CEO of Robin Hood, speaks at Howard University, in Washington on July 23, 2019.\" height=\"1669\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162858", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "40637", "source": "scrapy"},

Negotiations between the three countries have been at a stalemate for years after Ethiopia began constructing the Grand Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile in 2012.  Ethiopia says the project is needed to provide electricity. But Egypt is concerned the huge dam will severely reduce its water supplies and says it has \"historic rights\" to the river guaranteed by decades-old treaties. Egypt \"called for the involvement of an international party in the Renaissance Dam negotiations to mediate between the three countries,\" the irrigation ministry said in a statement late Saturday after a new round of talks ended in Khartoum. An impasse was reached after Ethiopia \"rejected all the proposals that take Egypt's water interests into account,\" the ministry added. It said Ethiopia presented a proposal that \"lacked guarantees\" of the minimum water flow as well as how to deal with possible droughts. The Ethiopian foreign ministry rejected Egypt's call for international mediation as \"an unwarranted denial of the progress\" of talks.  \"It also goes against the consent and wishes of Ethiopia,\" it added. The Egyptian presidency called on the United States to play \"an active role\" in the issue, invoking the need for an international party to \"overcome the deadlock\".  The White House had on Friday expressed \"support\" for the negotiations, urging all sides \"to put forth good faith efforts to reach an agreement\". Ethiopia, however, dismissed Cairo's assessment of the latest negotiations. \"The allegation that talks ended in a deadlock is completely false,\" Ethiopian Minister for Water and Energy Selishi Bekele told reporters on Saturday. He said that \"some progress has been made\" but acknowledged that there were \"pending issues\". Ethiopia's foreign ministry said Egypt's approach in the talks was \"another instance of a disruptive tactic it applied to halt the hydrology, environmental and social impact assessment\" of the dam. The Nile, which runs through 10 countries, is Africa's longest river and a crucial artery for water supplies and electricity for all the countries. Its main tributaries -- the White Nile and the Blue Nile -- converge in Khartoum before it flows through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. Ethiopia has said the $4 billion dam will begin generating power by the end of 2020 and will be fully operational by 2022. Analysts fear that the three Nile basin countries could be drawn into a conflict if the dispute is not resolved before the dam begins operating.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/06/112461-untitled-design-1.jpg?itok=2PHvgesT\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162858", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21434", "source": "scrapy"},

The worst losses were in Brazil, three times higher than the next highest country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to a report from Global Forest Watch based on satellite data.   Across the tropics, the study registered the destruction in 2020 of 4.2 million hectares (10.4 million acres) of primary forest -- 12 percent higher than the year before. Ecosystems straddling the equator shelter abundant biodiversity and store vast amounts of carbon. In total, the tropics lost 12.2 million hectares of tree cover -- including forests and plantations -- last year, driven largely by agriculture. But researchers said extreme heat and drought also stoked huge fires that consumed swathes of forest across Australia, Siberia and deep into the Amazon. These losses are a \"climate emergency. They're a biodiversity crisis, a humanitarian disaster, and a loss of economic opportunity\", said Frances Seymour of the World Resources Institute, which is behind the report.   The study found some evidence that Covid-19 restrictions may have had an effect around the world -- with an increase in illegal harvesting because forests were left less protected, or the return of large numbers of people to rural areas. But researchers said there was little sign that the pandemic had changed the trajectory of forest destruction and warned that the worst could be still to come if countries slash protections in an attempt to ramp up economic growth. But Seymour said the most \"ominous signal\" from the 2020 data is the instances of forests themselves falling victim to climate change. \"I mean, wetlands are burning,\" she said in a press briefing.   \"Nature has been whispering this risk to us for a long time. But now she is shouting.\" Plants -- especially in the tropics -- and soil comprise an enormous carbon sink, sucking up roughly a third of all the carbon pollution humans produce annually. Yet tropical forests continue to disappear rapidly, threatening irreparable losses to Earth's crucial biodiversity. Researchers said the destruction of tropical primary forests in 2020 released 2.64 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2020, equal to the annual emissions of India or 570 million cars, more than double the number on the road in the United States. \"The longer we wait to stop deforestation, and get other sectors on to net zero trajectories, the more likely it is that our natural carbon sinks will go up in smoke,\" Seymour said.   Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has cut funding for environmental programs and pushed to open protected Amazon lands to agribusiness and mining, lost 1.7 million hectares of primary forest in 2020, an increase of 25 percent from 2019, the report said. \"Brazil, having achieved a huge reduction in deforestation in the Amazon, is now seeing an unravelling of that success, and it's heartbreaking,\" said Seymour. Much of the loss was in the Amazon, including new areas that were deliberately cleared. But dry conditions also meant fires lit on previously deforested land spread to once humid forests, burning out of control.   Fires also devastated the Pantanal wetlands, a paradise of biodiversity that extend from Brazil into Bolivia -- the country with the third highest level of forest loss in 2020. Almost a third of the Pantanal was scorched, including indigenous lands and jaguar habitats, and researchers said it could be decades before the region recovers. One bright area was in Indonesia, which reduced its rate of forest loss by 17 percent from 2019 and dropped out of the global top three for the first time in the 20 years of Global Forest Watch monitoring. Forest destruction has slowed for four years in a row in Indonesia and researchers said government policies -- helped last year by wetter weather -- appeared to be having \"a long-term effect on reducing primary forest loss\".   Forests cover more than 30 percent of Earth's land surface, and tropical forests are home to between 50 and 90 percent of all terrestrial species. Recent research has shown that, beyond a certain threshold, deforestation in the Amazon basin could tip the region into a new climate regime, turning tropical forests into savannah. In January, two top Brazilian indigenous leaders asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate Bolsonaro for \"crimes against humanity\", accusing him of unprecedented environmental damage, killings and persecution. On Monday, a study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution estimated that rising demand in wealthy countries for commodities ranging from coffee to soybeans was accelerating deforestation in the tropics.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162859", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17509", "source": "scrapy"},

The government had imposed a lockdown to curb the spread of the pandemic but this impacted economic and commercial activities and resulted in job loss and later on the exodus of migrant workers which rocked the entire nation.   According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data, the unemployment rate was recorded at 6.9 per cent in February 2021 which is slightly better than 7.8 per cent in the same month last year and 8.8 per cent in March 2020, during which lockdown was imposed. The data showed that the unemployment rate had peaked to 23.5 per cent in April and remained at 21.7 per cent in May. It started tapering off from June onward when it was recorded at 10.2 per cent in the month and further improved to 7.4 per cent in July. However, the unemployment rate again rose slightly to 8.3 in August and improved to 6.7 per cent in September last year, as per CMIE data.   In October, unemployment again rose slightly to 7 per cent and then eased to 6.5 per cent in November last year as per the data. The CMIE data showed that the unemployment rate had risen to 9.1 per cent in December 2020 and improved in January to 6.5 per cent. Experts said that the CMIE data indicated improvement in the unemployment scenario from July onwards, but there is a need for consistency which would only come after an increase in buoyancy in the manufacturing and services sectors. They were of the view that the farm sector has done well which engages over 55 per cent of the country's population but there is a need for improvement in hiring in urban and industrial areas.   They opined that the government has taken many steps to boost fresh hiring in the country but repeated policy interventions and monitoring of existing schemes and initiatives at the ground level are required to achieve consistent improvement in the employment scenario in the country. According to labour ministry data, around 16.5 lakh people have benefited from the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) which was launched in October to encourage hiring in the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic till March 9, 2021. The scheme was introduced on October 1, 2020, to incentivise the creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during the pandemic.   This scheme, being implemented through the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), reduces the financial burden of the employers of various sectors/ industries and encourages them to hire more workers. Under the ABRY, Government of India is crediting for a period of two years both the employees' share (12 per cent of wages) and employers' share (12 per cent of wages) of contribution payable. Under the ABRY, about 16.5 lakhs beneficiaries registered themselves with the Scheme from October 1, 2020 and out of this, approximately 13.64 lakhs are new joinees with UAN (universal account number) generated on or after October 1, 2020, and approximately 2.86 lakhs are re-joinees who were rendered un-employed during the pandemic from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, and rejoined from October 1, 2020, onwards.   The experts said that the government intends to create 50 lakh to 60 lakh jobs through the ABRY in two years' time, but it required close monitoring and well-planned implementation to achieve the desired objective. Under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), Government of India has contributed both 12 per cent employer's share and 12 per cent employee's share under Employees Provident Fund (EPF), totaling 24 per cent of the wage for the wage month from March to August 2020, for the establishments having up to 100 employees with 90 per cent of such employees earning less than Rs 15,000. Under the PMGKY scheme, Rs 2,567.66 crore was credited in EPF accounts of 38.82 lakhs eligible employees.   The recently released latest EPFO payroll data showed that net new enrolments with the retirement fund body grew about 28 per cent to 13.36 lakh in January compared to the same month in 2020. The data also reflected a growth of 24 per cent for January 2021 over December last year. The EPFO has added around 62.49 lakh subscribers during the first ten months of the ongoing fiscal year, the data showed. During 2019-20, the number of net new subscribers rose to 78.58 lakh as compared to 61.12 lakh in the preceding fiscal. The EPFO payroll data also gives a perspective about the employment scenario in the country.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162859", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17320", "source": "scrapy"},

In yet another major development in the rape case against ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath, the victim has written to Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Police Commissioner alleging failure by the police to arrest him.  The letter written by the victim and addressed to Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava and Home Minister Amit Shah also questioned why the prosecution had failed to demand his presence at the time of filing an anticipatory bail application by the accused.  “This shocking degree of insensitivity towards my case is deeply distressing, and also makes me understand the true reason as to why so many rape victims in our country choose to suffer in silence, rather than to seek justice against their perpetrators,” said the victim in her letter, a copy of which is accessed by India Legal. The letter comes two days after the Delhi High Court granted interim protection from arrest to ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath in a case registered against him under charges of rape. A single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta on April 9 granted the relief, however, she clarified that the same would only be provided if Hiremath joins the investigation. Mumbai-based ET Now Anchor Varun Hiremath has been accused of raping a 22-year-old Pune-based woman in New Delhi. The journalist was anticipating arrest in connection with the FIR lodged by the woman in Chanakyapuri Police station under sec. 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint, the woman had alleged that she was raped by Hiremath in ITC Maurya Hotel in Chanakyapuri. However, Hiremath denied the allegation as false and frivolous as the FIR was registered after a delay of 3 days i.e on 23rd February 2021. Thereafter, Hiremath moved the Bombay High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail which was rejected last month. While rejecting the plea, Justice P.D. Naik observed that the applicant is charged under Section 376 of IPC, hence, the court is not inclined to grant such relief in this case. However, the applicant may approach the appropriate court, the Judge had said. Later, a Delhi court had also refused the anticipatory bail application of Hiremath, while observing that if the woman states in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent. The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Khanagwal.  \n \n \n   \n \n", "image_url": "<img width=\"694\" height=\"503\" class=\"entry-thumb\" src=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1.jpg 694w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-300x217.jpg 300w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-579x420.jpg 579w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-324x235.jpg 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" alt=\"\" title=\"Varun-Hiremath\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162854", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Diwali, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Eid, Christmas, and Kumbh Mela, the mother of all festivals, are clearly not enough. We probably have the most literary festivals in the world. Other countries have run-of-the-mill elections. India,   and   has a “festival of democracy” Therefore it’s hardly surprising that in the middle of the second wave of   , the prime minister wants the good citizens of India to have themselves a   or a vaccination festival. In his speech, Narendra Modi suggested that a   between 11 and 14 April could boost the vaccination drive. Also, 11 April happens to be the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotiba Phule while 14 April is that of Babasaheb Ambedkar. This could be some strategist’s brainwave of killing two birds with one jab. One year ago as India went into lockdown the prime minister had other festive ideas to raise our spirits - we clanged pots and pans, blew conch shells, lit divas. There were even WhatsApp forwards about how that vibration was going to destroy the virus. One year later the virus is rampaging through the country in its second wave, those WhatsApp forwarders have move on to other causes and we have upped the game from pots and pans and candles to a full-fledged festival. Cynics might roll their eyes but the prime minister knows that as soon as it’s called a festival it becomes a red-letter day in our minds. Amazon and Flipkart can do “Tika Utsav” bumper sales starting on 12:01 am on 11 April until 11:59 pm on 14 April. Pizza Hut can deliver Tika Utsav special pizzas - with tika kebab toppings of course. Each city can have friendly contests to see which centre doles out the most shots in one day, that’s vaccine shots, not alcoholic ones. Anything that encourages vaccination is of course something to be encouraged. And the prime minister is in his own way a cheerleader-in-chief for the nation. Thus he is to be commended for trying to encourage all eligible Indians to go out and get vaccinated. And if some upbeat festival messaging works better than doom-and-gloom portents so be it. Of course, there is a danger that in the rush to celebrate tika utsavs, we could crowd vaccination centres and forget about social distancing but that’s a minor quibble. But what feels incongruous is this cheery PSA for a “festival of vaccination” occurs at the same time as a “festival of democracy” is unfolding in so many states across India. The pandemic and the election seem to be occurring in different worlds, hermetically sealed from each other. There are two Indias, one in which a   second wave is raging and one in which elections are happening and apparently never the twain shall meet. Mind you this is a country where a court rules that you can be fined for not wearing your mask while alone in your car. A vehicle is a “public place” says the Delhi High Court but a political rally is obviously not. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan recently scolded his fellow citizens for letting down their guard and allowing the Covid numbers to explode afresh. He blamed “lack of commitment and sincerity” and said, “nobody is interested in wearing the mask.. there’s no respect for the norms of physical distancing.” , the same minister shared pictures of his party leaders holding election rallies where hardly anyone was wearing a mask and there was certainly no physical distancing happening. “One look at Harsh Vardhan’s Twitter feed makes it quite clear who could be called out “for taking everything casually’” writes Rohan Venkataramakrishnan in  . It’s not a BJP problem. It’s a problem pretty much across the political spectrum. Old habits die hard. Old electioneering habits die especially hard. Photographs from rallies across Bengal for example, whether Trinamool or BJP or the Left Front-Congress combine, would hardly suggest the country is grappling with a pandemic. It looks just like something from five years ago. Perhaps the fact that the Bihar elections did not cause a huge explosion in infections lulled us into a false sense of complacency. But these elections are happening in the middle of a certified second wave. Yet the same politicians who wag their fingers at the public for giving safety precautions a “tilanjali” seem to have no interest in leading by example. And they do not even see the jarring dissonance. It is obviously not easy in a country like India to do physical distancing at the best of times, let alone at election time. But we can do our bit. The symbolism matters. Though Donald Trump sneered at Joe Biden for wearing a mask during his campaign, Biden resolutely stuck to it. The open-air inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with the guests wearing masks sent out two messages - one, that the business of democracy and transition of power must go one and two, they must go on with as much safety precautions as possible in these grave times. It was about fortitude in face of a pandemic not the denial of it. It will never be foolproof but the message is important. The visual of masked politicians on stage at an election rally in India would send out a message as well. A top political leader taking his mask off to address the rally and then putting it back on would send out a message. Similarly, a crowded stage filled with maskless jostling politicians sends out its own message to the rank and file. A political candidate in Kolkata told reporters asking him about lack of masks and safety norms that he was “not afraid” of the virus and he would win, Covid or no Covid. Tirath Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand tells devotees planning to attend Mahakumbh that “nobody will be stopped in the name of   ” because “faith is stronger than fear”. Two days later he tested positive. At this point it’s baffling that politicians still think bravado is the vaccine we all need. Now the Haridwar district magistrate has said all schools in the district will remain closed from 9 to 15 April not because of   fears but “in view of a huge rush of devotees to Kumbh Mela.”    It’s clear that after a year everyone is suffering from Covid safety exhaustion. The masks are slipping and weddings and parties are back and public transport is crowded. We read about rising numbers and lack of beds but there’s no indication that it’s affecting our behaviour. A video of a cheerful woman at a temple during Holi telling a reporter there was no Covid there recently went viral. Despite Yogi Adityanath’s strongman reputation in Uttar Pradesh, his exhortation to maintain safety protocols during Holi seemed to fall on many deaf ears. People are tired of a year of safety protocols or lulled by the dip in numbers at the end of 2020 or both. But now that the second wave has truly landed, mixed messages from the political leaders do not help. While the PM exhorts us to not let down our guard, we just hear \"no lockdown\". The prime minister in his message about the second wave has reiterated the focus needs to be on “test, track, treat, Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid management”. That’s commendable. But perhaps the time has come for politicians of all parties, not just the aam aadmi, to also exhibit that “Covid-appropriate behaviour”. And if we must turn everything into a festival, what about a month-long “mask festival” instead of just a tika one?", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" alt=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tamil-nadu-election_BJP_PTI_640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162904", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "47301", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.indialegallive.com", "section": "Home", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/", "title": "Courts", "author": null, "author_link": "", "published_date": "April 11, 2021", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162904", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Two years ago, I had the honour of interacting with him personally at a well-attended conclave of prominent judges and eminent members of the legal profession discussing the Insolvency and Banktuptcy Code, (IBC) a major reform measure.  At a professional level, his reasoning, analytical abilities, depth of knowledge and presentation skills in handling a highly specialised and complex subject were unbeatable. At a personal level, I found him ruminative, soft-spoken, courtly and conscientious but, most of all, infectiously humble.  He has chaired several committees related to the IBC law, a commendable initiative that has helped India leapfrog ahead in the list of countries known for the ease of doing business.  In fact, IBC has changed the whole thought process in the insolvency sector. The entire thrust of IBC is in the revival of sick businesses. Such is the impact of IBC today that there is hardly a day where developments related to it do not get reported in the press, either local or national. In addition to his unique expertise on specific subjects, Justice Ramana, during his long tenure as a judge of the Supreme Court, has been party to numerous judgments. Notable judgments include:   (2019), dealing with the Right to Information Act, 2005,   (2020) and  ’s case which held that compensation for housewives must depend on the work being performed by them, therefore granting dignity to women who are homemakers.  The judgments in   and   have paved the way for flexibility of appointments to tribunals and the autonomy and freedom of state governments to design their own fiscal legislation respectively. Our curtain-raiser story in last week’s issue, described Justice Ramana  as a “kind, considerate and soft-spoken judge, who is eager to do justice and give counsel appearing before him a patient hearing with an open mind. His vast experience of being a judge for some 20 years, eight of which have been acquired in the apex court, will come to his aid in a remarkable way”. We also pointed out that his understanding of the higher judiciary as the chief justice of the Delhi High Court and acting chief justice of the Andhra Pradesh High Court provided him great perspective while carrying out his duties as the fountainhead and paterfamilias of the judiciary. His tenure as a government counsel for various departments and as an additional advocate general have given him a deep understanding of the functioning of government departments, bringing to fore his expertise in civil, criminal, constitutional, labour, service and election matters. His humble beginnings, our article noted last week:   “have given him an insight into the suffering of the common man, which has also made him a champion of civil liberties from the very beginning of his college days and later as a journalist. He has great empathy for those requiring protection of human rights. His tenure, no doubt, will be marked by compassion, expertise and wisdom”. As the head of one of the three pillars of the State, it becomes the responsibility of the CJI to ensure that reformation and transformation continue faster than ever. The disposal rate of cases across the country must move ahead at least twice the speed with which matters get filed. The functioning of all the tiers of the courts and the tribunals are matters of great concern and requires the attention of the CJI. We wish him a happy journey ahead. \n \n \n   \n \n", "image_url": "<img width=\"1068\" height=\"601\" class=\"entry-thumb\" src=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1068x601.jpg\" srcset=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-696x392.jpg 696w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3-747x420.jpg 747w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/03125829/Edit-3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1068px) 100vw, 1068px\" alt=\"CJI Ramana\" title=\"CJI Ramana\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162904", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Greg Abbott about why he had attacked the Biden administration over reports of sexual assault at a migrant shelter despite being silent on the matter when   was in office. Abbott, a Republican,   Wednesday that his state had received complaints of sexual abuse at a federal facility that houses migrant youth. Abbott blamed President  ’s immigration policies and called for the facility to be shut down. But immigrant advocates condemned Abbott’s press conference as political theater, noting that he failed to speak up over   at immigrant detention centers during the Trump administration. “Governor, there were thousands of complaints of sexual assault at migrant shelters during the Trump years,” Wallace said   with Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” “Not to say that what’s going on now is right, but we couldn’t find one instance of you complaining and calling that out when President Trump was president.” Abbott said there were “multiple differences” between how the Trump and Biden administrations handled the alleged sexual abuse, including the “constant communication” his office received from Trump officials on the matter. He went on to suggest that he was fully aware of the migrant sexual assault allegations during the Trump administration but didn’t speak out at the time because those complaints were filed with federal agencies. “The one that I talked about earlier this past week were reports that were filed with state agencies,” Abbott said. “So we have a duty to respond to any complaint about child sexual abuse as well as to investigate it and that’s exactly what I did to make sure it was addressed.” “Don’t fall prey to Democrats or others saying, ‘Well, Abbott didn’t complain about this in the past,’” he added. “What they need to focus on is exactly what I called attention to last month in Dallas, Texas, where I pointed out then that there were going to be instances of child sex abuse taking place.” The sex abuse Abbott cited Wednesday allegedly took place at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. More than 1,300 teens who crossed the border into the U.S. from Mexico without a parent or guardian are reportedly being held there. “In short, this facility is a health and safety nightmare,” Abbott told reporters Wednesday. “The Biden administration is now presiding over the abuse of children.” From 2014 to 2018, under the Obama administration and subsequent Trump presidency, the Department of Health and Human Services received more than 4,500 complaints of sexual harassment and abuse against government-run migrant shelters,  . “The only reason why Abbott is now acting like he cares about the children in these facilities is for political reasons,” Jonathan Ryan, CEO of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, said in a statement. “What the governor wants is for the Biden administration to stop allowing children to seek home and safety in this country,” Ryan added. “That is not the solution to the challenge we have in front of us. We must ensure the children are released as soon as possible and be reunited with their families in the U.S.” Watch Abbott’s full appearance on “Fox News Sunday” below.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7a3186240000651c787229.jpg?ops=100_100\" height=\"38px\" width=\"38px\" alt=\"headshot\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162848", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "60175", "source": "scrapy"},

A paper on Covaxin's neutralisation potential against the UK strain has been accepted for publication, he said here on Thursday while addressing an international webinar \"Kerala Health: Making the SDG A Reality,\"organised by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Kerala.   In the case of the variants from South Africa and Brazil, efforts were on to isolate the mutated virus strains from the samples collected from travellers from these two countries, he said.

Dr Bhargava pointed out that India was the fifth country in the world to isolate the Covid-19 virus as part of the efforts to develop a vaccine for the pandemic. With its graded response to the outbreak of Covid-19 right from the beginning, India had successfully kept the spread of the pandemic under control while utilising this period for drastically scaling up the capacity of the country's medical infrastructure, both under the government and the private sector.   India had from the outset resisted the temptation of going for herd immunity unlike many European countries, including the UK and Italy, and its decision had been vindicated from what happened in the western nations that allowed the pandemic to spread, he pointed out.

Hareesh’s controversial novel, Moustache (original Meesha) has won the 2020 JCB Prize for Literature", "text": "The world’s largest literature festival, JLF, is back again with its lavish intellectual fare, albeit in an online-only avatar. Thanks to the hard work of the organisers, that has not turned out to be limiting or constraining in any fashion. . With knowledge is associated this counterintuitive fact; that in the places where you expend it, it expands and, in the absence of that, it does verily contract. Novelist and festival co-director Namita Gokhale opened the 14th edition of JLF with this couplet from the quill of Vrind, the 17th century Marwari saint.   Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world. That is what Albert Einstein believed, and that is the connect between science and the arts. In the very next session, Tilly Blyth, head of collections and principal curator at the Science Museum in London, came out with this mind-expanding thought. India is a little bit like Italy but with a billion people, said quantum physicist Carlo Rovelli, writer of  , during a scintillating conversation with astronomer Priyamvada Natarajan. Rovelli is the founder of the loop quantum gravity theory. What brought you to Buddhist philosophy as a way of understanding these complex concepts, said Natarajan to Rovelli. Rovelli said, quantum mechanics tell us three things. Two of them are relatively simple and one is mysterious. Quantum physics tells us about granularity. It tells us that the space in which we live is granular, not continuous. The second thing it tells us is that this space consists of things that move randomly. The third and mysterious thing is that quantum mechanics is a theory that tells us about not how things are at a given place and time but what you are going to see. If you try to fill in the gaps in-between it does not always work. So the mystery of quantum mechanics is still open. And that is where my interest in Buddhist thought emerged. It is the breakdown of determinism and the fact that an observer can alter the results just by being present, that is what is interesting, Natarajan summarised quite cogently. Nagarjuna, the third century Mahayana philosopher, said that all notions are provisional after a point. There is no ultimate essence to anything, Rovelli explained. There are no qualia, Natarajan agreed. An object manifests only in relation to others. Without them, the object is “empty”. Is this what is then meant when one is told not to take anything too seriously?   S. Hareesh’s controversial novel,   (original ) has won the 2020 JCB Prize for Literature. It is all about the fascination of the familiar, says Professor Tejaswini Niranjana, depicting as it does life in the Kuttanad region of Kerala. To her credit, translator Jayasree Kalathil ably conveys the mesmerising quality of Hareesh's prose to non-Malayali readers. But author Aruni Kashyap says it is also a novel that misbehaves. We expect novels to run in a linear way, to follow one story or one character. Here, there are multiple worlds, multiple stories, multiple protagonists. And in many ways that is the Indian reality, it is very polyphonic, multi-layered. What gets published in the British, American and Canadian literary markets, kind of, decides how a novel should be. But growing up reading Indian literature one sees how we have adapted the European form to ourselves. One of the big things is that we never have a single character, he informs his audience. Interestingly, the introduction to Hareesh’s book has the following, liberating, lines: Novels are free countries. You cannot take responsibility for what your characters do.   The first amendment to the Indian Constitution in 1951 started the tradition of Indian governments using executive power to subdue the judiciary, posited journalist Karan Thapar to which historian Tripurdaman Singh agreed. Singh has recently published his  . The justification about “the will of the people” that was used by Jawaharlal Nehru (to curb free speech in order to abolish zamindari, introduce caste-based reservations and censor publications deemed as national security threats) really set a trend from which there was no going back, he added. Sedition seems to be one of the favourite instruments of the Narendra Modi government, but it was pretty favourable to previous governments as well, said Thapar. In 1950, the Punjab high court famously read down the law of sedition in the Master Tara Singh case and the first amendment in 1951 reintroduced the law of sedition. Thus Nehru, Sardar Patel and B.R. Ambedkar, the three people that we regard as champions of democracy don’t emerge brilliantly from this story, he concluded.   Singh responded: Nehru is a complex figure. He had moral uncertainties. But he had so much public support that he did what he wanted. It was juxtaposed by a very pedantic commitment to the procedures of democracy, he was, for instance, very fastidious about attending parliament. Ambedkar, who only resigned several months after the passing of the amendment, was a bit of a misfit in the Nehru government and did not carry too much weight, did not get much of a say in matters. He probably went along because of the social justice aspect of the amendment. Patel considered free speech as irrational exuberance. Nehru had used the powers of Article 392 to pass the amendment, much the same way as Modi used Article 370 to read down Article 370, Thapar commented.   The paradoxes of the life of the nineteenth century Bengali poet Michael Madhusudan Dutt are movingly rendered in a play, titled  , co-authored by Namita Gokhale and Professor Malashri Lal. You have made Jaipur famous not only in Jaipur but the world over, given it a brand name really, Lal said to Gokhale at the panel discussion. Interestingly, Dutt, too, has a connection with Rajasthan. The play that he wrote called  is based on a legend that is coming to us through Colonel James Tod’s . Why Dutt now? What if I were to invite Dutt to JLF, mused Gokhale. How would he behave? How would we handle him? I am sure he would be a difficult writer to look after, but a brilliant speaker. I am obsessed by the writing process. In 2004, I wrote a review of   as well as another book on Dutt, and I resolved there and then to do a play around them because the letters in the   were automatically, naturally, spontaneously, forming a sequence of five acts. We have tried to pay a tribute to the great genius of this man overshadowed by the dramatic and colourful and ultimately tragic details of his life.   The Booker-shortlisted Adam Fould’s new novel,  , is about the brutality of fame and what happens when fandom turns to obsession.   explores what it is to live in our current moment, with its porous borders between the inner and the outer life. Foulds was asked by Elaine Canning to talk about the blurring of the dream and the magical with the real in the novel. In the word, dream, we have the double meaning of ambition, in the sense of something that we aspire to and the sense of something that is unreal, a fantasy. Both these meanings are captured in the lives of the two main characters. In life, too, there is more and more the saturation of fantasy and the liquefying of reality in people’s lives that is happening in so many ways, in terms of our online life and political life, where we are entering a kind of dream sequence very frequently. Unlike in earlier times, today, with social media, we can track the celebrities we are interested in real time, in terms of where they are and what they are doing, and we can interact with them and have them respond to us, and yet it is all saturated with fantasy and does not really mean what we might hope it could mean, Foulds said. His observations were immediately relatable.   In her chat with author Shobhaa De on her autobiography, , actor Priyanka Chopra Jonas spoke highly of her co-actor in the film,  , Adarsh Gourav, as well as the success of the OTT (over-the-top) platform. Adarsh has done tremendous work and might be nominated as one of the first Indian leading men, she averred. But Chopra Jonas has an unfinished agenda. It wasn’t in people’s consciousnesses that a brown person can be the lead of the show, she said to De. Literally, there used to be a saying in Hollywood during that time that black and brown movies do not work for audiences outside America. This was the insider’s myth and, incredibly, we have been able to change that in just five years’ time.   is probably historic. It has an all-Indian star cast that was the No. 1 movie in the world on the largest streaming platform in the world. That’s what I want to normalise — seeing people who look like us. We have the largest movie industry in the world. Why can’t we have that kind of representation in English speaking entertainment?   Talk about game changers?", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162905", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "20554", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.nbcnews.com", "section": "business", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pandemic-silver-lining-employers-start-recognize-importance-caregiving-benefits-n1263295", "title": "Pandemic silver lining? Employers start to recognize importance of caregiving benefits", "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "April 7, 2021, 6:09 PM UTC", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "“Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, because we were literally zooming into people’s homes,” said one recruitment expert.", "text": "For millions of Americans, the pandemic triggered an acute caregiving crisis, with working parents leaving their jobs as weeks of remote schooling turned into an entire year. But it has also forced a reckoning in corporate America about the day-to-day demands on working caregivers in general — and working mothers in particular. “Child care and balancing the demands of, say, dealing with a sick kid, have been perennial issues, even pre-Covid,” said Andrew Challenger, vice president at executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The pandemic, Challenger said, essentially pulled back the curtain to expose a rickety, fragmented system that didn’t function very well even at the best of times. When school resumed last fall, 865,000 women dropped out of the workforce between August and September alone, and women’s labor force participation has continued to plummet: As of last month, the labor force participation rate for men older than 19 was 69.5 percent. For the corresponding cohort of women, it was 57.4 percent. What happens next — and how much of the lessons of the pandemic will be retained in the future — could turn out to be an unexpected silver lining during a year of unprecedented stress and challenges. “Sometimes it takes a big crisis to set in motion shifts in compensation,” Challenger said. “This has always been part of the conversation — how do you give flexibility for the worker but still have consistency for the employer? This is something that has been exacerbated during the pandemic,” said Aliya Robinson, senior vice president of retirement and compensation policy for the ERISA Industry Committee, an association focused on benefits at large companies. “With this whole shift to work-from-home, I think a lot of employers realized there's a lot more ability than they anticipated to have employees working from home,” she said. This, in turn, has paved the way for greater acceptance of remote work, scheduling flexibility and more willingness to expand benefits specifically for caregivers — particularly as employers face the prospect of losing valuable talent. “I think it does indicate that this issue, particularly for women around caregiving and careers, has at least been recognized by a large number of organizations. In this crisis, we saw such an outflow of women from the workforce as the coronavirus hit,” Challenger said. “I think you’re starting to see smart companies recognize that if they want to be the best possible company they can be, which means having a diverse set of individuals leading their organization, that it's going to take an active effort to get women back into the pipeline and back into the office.” Research by the Society for Human Resource Management found that women are worried — often rightly so — that dropping out of the workforce can hurt their career advancement: A recent survey found that 27 percent of working women who also act as caregivers said the pandemic had hurt their professional development, compared to just 10 percent of men who said the same. According to surveys of 500 HR managers conducted by Care.com, human resources departments are reevaluating the kinds of benefits they offer employees — and making adjustments to address the yawning gap between caregiving demands and employers’ accommodation of those obligations. More than three in five survey respondents said they plan to increase childcare benefits, while about two in five will expand offerings for elder care. “Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, and that’s because we were literally 'Zooming' into people’s homes,” said Alyssa Johnson, senior director of account management at Care.com. “Employers have literally had a front-row seat into people's homes and lives, and they've seen the challenges families have faced,” she said. “It’s just an acknowledgement of this idea that emergencies happen, emergency child care situations arise. Companies that have now been forced to reckon with a mass child care emergency now have the tools and wherewithal to help employees,” Challenger said. Addressing this is less a matter of altruism than accounting. “Half of HR leaders are seeing productivity decrease in working parents,” Johnson said. “It’s never been clearer — employers are realizing that care challenges have had a significant impact on their workforce, and there is just a real connection between child care and employee performance.” In addition to diminished productivity, employee departures extract a tangible financial toll on employers. “They may actually lose a significant portion of their workforce. That can affect the bottom line,” said Amber Clayton, director of the Society for Human Resource Management Knowledge Center. The opportunity cost of having to devote resources to recruit, hire and train replacements when women leave the workforce can be steep: Pre-pandemic research from SHRM suggested that replacing a salaried employee can cost between six and nine months of that worker’s annual pay. “Hiring and re-hiring is really expensive. Companies are always looking to decrease turnover. There's a real recognition that this is an issue that needs to be addressed,” Challenger said. HR experts report that employers are experimenting with different tools and approaches to ease the burden of caregivers trying to juggle work and family obligations. In addition to greater acceptance of remote work and nontraditional work hours — including longer breaks so parents can supervise kids’ remote lessons — some have expanded paid or unpaid leave, provided subsidies for on-site or in-home child care, or offered on-site child care for employees who can’t work from home. “Employers have stepped up and are making those accommodations,” Clayton said. In a recent survey of more than 200 HR executives, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 84 percent said they are offering workers more flexibility, with many making changes specifically in response to workers’ caregiving obligations. Two out of five reported that they specifically have extended greater flexibility to parents, with 23 percent expanding paid time off and 13 percent offering child care options. Of those, the vast majority — 95 percent — said they plan to make some or all of these changes permanent. “I think it was very eye-opening for employers,” Clayton said. “It forced them to look at their policies and procedures overall.” This is a paradigm shift, experts say, that is long overdue. “It highlighted the need for employers to step in and play a role,” Johnson said. “When families are forced to choose between families and work, no one wins.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3462714/210407-working-childcare-mn-1040_67b30ef91687ca8364dadee5fa16d84c.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"young woman working at home while holding her newborn baby son\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2499\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162859", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "43132", "source": "scrapy"},

It was a rigorous contest of more than 100 participants at the start, 30 in the final round, and the Sikh girl admitted she was delighted to score over so many beautiful contestants.   But she admitted that she had worked hard at for the contest for nearly six months, with gruelling fitness routines, catwalk sessions and Q&A training programmes. What did she think was the most important quality needed in this highly competitive field? “Confidence”, said Praveenar simply. She displayed this in plenty as she sashayed down the ramp, wearing a wide range of outfits, from slinky evening gowns to sexy swimsuits. A native of Chiangmai in the north of Thailand, Praveenar said she enjoyed the provincial atmospherics of this small town. “Apart from the cool, wonderful weather, it’s small and intimate city. There is also a large Sikh community, and everyone is family there”, she said.   Praveenar did her schooling in Chiangmai, and then moved to Bangkok’s prestigious Thammasat University, where she did an arts degree with Russia as her major. “I was fascinated by the number of Russian tourists in Chiangmai and thought it would be fun to be a tourist guide and show them around my lovely hometown!” She said she also loved Russian books and culture, and that’s why she chose the course. After winning the recent beauty contest, it looks like modelling will be the future career for this attractive girl, who has already partaken in many fashion shows, both in Bangkok and in Mumbai. “The girls in India are so confident, smart, successful -- they really inspire me. That’s why India has produced so many beauty queens!”   One of her best holidays in India, she says, was when she visited Delhi, Shimla, Jaipur, Agra and Punjab (where her mother was born) last year. “It reminded me of who I am, and I’m waiting to go back, after the Covid crisis is over,” she said. Praveenar exercises regularly, and loves sports, especially basketball and also Thai boxing (“for muscle and strength”). She was proud that she won the “Miss Perfect Skin Award” at the Ms Universe contest, saying that a combination of healthy diet, exercise, sleep, contributed to it. The model and beauty contest winner confessed that she was enjoying the best of both worlds in Thailand.   “It’s truly a land of smiles. But what I love the most is that so much of Indian culture is prevalent here. They celebrate many Indian festivals here. In fact, recently I was a special guest at a big Diwali event in Bangkok’s most sophisticated mall -- Icon Siam.” Praveenar also loves the fact that there are many Indian temples and gurdwaras here, which is where she mostly interacts with her community. She confessed that Indian food was her favourite, especially palak paneer. That’s why she likes visiting India often, enjoying eating the best of Indian food there, as also the best of shopping, not to forget music and films.   Praveenar is a big fan of Bollywood, and has many favourite Bollywood films (Three Idiots, Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham). Amitabh Bachchan is her all-time favourite actor. She confessed: “Like most beauty contest winners, I have dreams of Bollywood too.” Having worked earlier as a model in Mumbai for three months, she said she had got “some offers” after winning the beauty contest in Bangkok. “I can’t give more details, but I hope the Covid-19 pandemic ends soon, so that I can move forward and do some work in India.   Lekha Shankar is an Indian journalist based in Bangkok", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162905", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17563", "source": "scrapy"},

Tellagunta villagers of Bogole mandal boycotted the polling to express their protest over not providing drinking water facilities in the village. In Prakasam district, the car of Darsi MLA Maddisetty Venugopal’s brother Ravindra was damaged as he went to Sivaramapuram village in Tallur mandal to see the polling trend. In West Godavari, a voter identified as Seshadri Venkata Durga Prasad was arrested by the Undi police as he tried to pour ink on ballot papers at the 32nd polling station in the village.   In East Godavari, polling was stopped for some time at a polling station located Sakurru village in Amalapuram as the ‘Glass’ symbol of Jana Sena party was not printed on the ballot paper.

A retired woman teacher Nrisimhadevara Simhachalam died while waiting for an auto-rickshaw to reach a polling station to cast her vote at Katrenikona. Police booked a case against a voter Kasi Venkata Ramana for taking a selfie with the ballot paper at a polling station at Pallamkurru village in Katrenikona mandal.

A repoll is likely to be held on Friday. Several adivasis in Visakhapatnam and other places faced a tough time to reach the polling stations for want of proper road connectivity. Hundreds of them crossed Matyasagedda in Arasu mandal to reach the polling stations. In Kurnool, two groups of voters entered into heated arguments at Devanakonda as some of them tried to resort to cross-voting. Police rushed to the spot and restored normalcy.   In Kadapa, at Utpativaripalle of Badvel mandal, YSR Congress supporters acted as agents at a polling station instead of TD activists, forcing the TD nominee Sirisha Reddy and the party agents to stage a protest. TD agents alleged that the signatures on the forms were not theirs. In Rajuvaripeta of Chapadu mandal, YSR Congress activists did not allow a TD agent to sit in the polling station. MPTC nominee Rajeshwari tried to disrupt the polling, forcing the police to take her into custody. In Guntur, TD activists from Gonepudi and Palapadu villages staged a protest in front of Narasaraopeta sub collector’s office, alleging that their polling agents were not being allowed to enter the polling stations by the YSR Congress leaders with the support from CI Krishnaiah.   The villagers from both the villages demanded a repoll and sought suspension of the CI.

The 57-year-old Black woman from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, feared that her high blood pressure and diabetes might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. Then a member of Pringle’s church, a local NAACP leader who has led a vaccination campaign targeting Black residents, urged her to reconsider. He shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. “That’s what made me change my mind,” said Pringle, who finally agreed to an appointment to get her first   shot Thursday. “I had to pray about it. And I felt better after that.” Campaigns aimed at Black communities across the US are making headway in the effort to persuade people that the   vaccines are safe and effective. With millions of dollars in assistance from President Joe Biden’s administration, local groups have urged Black Americans to roll up their sleeves for shots and set aside what for some is a shared historical distrust of science and government. A poll by   for Public Affairs Research in late March found that about 24 percent of Black American adults said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. That’s down from 41 percent in January. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots in almost the same proportion as white Americans at 26 percent and Hispanic Americans at 22 percent. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken “almost a 180-degree turnaround” as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. He credited Black physicians, faith leaders and other community organisers for being trusted messengers during the pandemic, which has killed more than 5,50,000 Americans. “It’s the messenger and the message,” but the messenger “is probably the most important part of it, and people doing it in a way that wasn’t preachy,” Benjamin said. “They didn’t tell people, ‘You need to get vaccinated because it’s your duty.’ They basically said, ‘Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family.’” Some of the most effective outreach has relied on existing community relationships, such as local physicians talking about their own decisions to get vaccinated, to reassure the public, said Dr Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. Community members in the Baltimore area who knew Cooper from her research on food deserts and nutrition trusted her as a source of information on   , she said. Based on that relationship, “people felt comfortable hearing from me,” she said. Some state health departments have rolled out ads targeting communities of color. NAACP chapters in some cities have booked appointments for people to get shots. Pastors of Black churches have urged their parishioners to take the vaccines. In Brunswick, Georgia, the Rev John Perry and another Black pastor put their faces on a billboard promoting the vaccines, and postcards with a similar image were mailed to residents. Both efforts were produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. “I think we still have enough people on the fence that are going to budge and get their shots,” said Perry, who initially wanted to wait a year before getting his shots but changed his mind after reading up on how the vaccines were developed. He got his second dose Wednesday. Jason Pettibone, a Black barber in Perry’s coastal Georgia community, remains hesitant. His parents and sister have all been vaccinated with no ill effects. Yet Pettibone said the stories he hears from customers — including one who swore his father lost all feeling in the right side of his body after getting a shot — have made it hard to overcome his uncertainty. “I’m thinking in my head not only would it be good for me to get it, because I don’t want to get sick myself, but also to protect other people who come into the shop,” Pettibone said. “But it’s the unknown. Everybody’s really scared of the unknown.” In Savannah, Georgia, community activist Natavia Sanders said outreach efforts can backfire with some in the Black community who suspect the government is targeting them as test subjects rather than seeking to protect their health. Some of that skepticism can be traced to an infamous study in Tuskegee, Alabama, where the government let hundreds of Black men suffer untreated syphilis for 40 years for research purposes. Sanders declined to say whether she was getting vaccinated. She said she’s spoken with several people who had to be hospitalised with   but still have doubts about the vaccines. “That’s how skeptical people are,” Sanders said. “They’re like, ‘No, I’ll fight it myself. I fought it already.’” PM Browner got her vaccine Wednesday in Clarksdale, Mississippi. The 88-year-old Black woman said she doesn’t understand why she needs to get vaccinated if she’s not sick or around sick people. Still, she agreed to get her shot. She said she thinks vaccinations will eventually be required, and she wants to be able to continue to socialise at a local senior center. “If you ain’t got nothing, why do we need to take it?” Browner said. “But we’ll take it because later on, they’ll say, ‘You’ve got to take it.’ If you don’t, later on, I think we’ll have to.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" alt=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pfizer-vaccine-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162906", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "41723", "source": "scrapy"},

In a clip posted by him, the radiation levels can be seen hovering 16 times above normal on a Geiger device, which is used to measure radiation. The fire is increasingly gaining traction and is currently burning over 250 acres of forest land. Ukrainian authorities have responded to the crisis by deploying two aircraft, a helicopter, and over 100 firefighters to contain the fire. As per media reports, the fire began on Saturday and continued to circle the abandoned town. However, the radiation levels remained stable yesterday, as the fire remained contained within the burning grounds. Even though high radiation is dangerous, local authorities claim that nearby towns are safe.  However, the radiation is a potential hazard for firefighters, who are directly in the line of fire. Even after 33 years, the radiation levels have not normalised, and are not expected to normalise for many decades to come. The fallout from any nuclear plant or disaster has long-term effects.

The government toll only represents the number of deaths recorded in hospitals in the ambit of the National Health Services in the country. The figures for deaths in care homes are running 12 days behind the daily reported deaths. This is owing to dependence on registered death certificates, which can take over a week to be processed. The death toll could even be higher than 1,000, as there is a lag of over 17 days between home care deaths and the announcement.

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call.

Smart home assistants such as Amazon's Alexa have found success worldwide, but tech firms in Japan are reporting huge demand for more human-like alternatives, as people seek solace during coronavirus isolation.   \"I felt my circle became very small,\" said 23-year-old Hamaura, a recent graduate who has worked almost entirely remotely since April 2020. With socialising limited, life in her first job at a Tokyo trading company was nothing like she had imagined. So she adopted Charlie, a mug-sized robot with a round head, red nose and flashing bow-tie, who converses with its owner in song. Yamaha, which makes Charlie, describes it as \"more chatty than a pet, but less work than a lover\". \"He is there for me to chat with as someone other than family, or friends on social networks, or a boss I needed to produce a report for,\" Hamaura told AFP.   She is a pre-launch test customer for Charlie, which Yamaha plans to release later this year. \"Charlie, tell me something interesting,\" she asks while typing at her dining table. \"Well, well... balloons burst when you spray lemon juice!\" he replies, cheerfully tilting his head to each side. Sharp said sales of its small humanoid Robohon were up 30 percent in the three months to September 2020 compared with a year earlier. \"Not only families with children, but also seniors in their 60s and 70s\" are snapping up Robohon, which talks, dances and is also a working phone, a Sharp spokesman told AFP. But the adorable android -- first released in 2016 and only available in Japan -- does not come cheap, with regular models priced between $820 and $2,250.   Charlie and Robohon are part of a new wave of robot companions pioneered by firms such as Sony with its robot dog Aibo, on sale since 1999, and SoftBank's friendly Pepper, which hit shelves in 2015. \"Many Japanese people accept the idea that every object has a soul,\" said Shunsuke Aoki, CEO of robot firm Yukai Engineering. \"They want a robot to have a character, like a friend, family or a pet -- not a mechanical function like a dishwasher.\" Yukai's robots include Qoobo, a fluffy pillow with a mechanical tail that wiggles like a real pet. They will soon release their latest home assistant \"Bocco emo\", which looks like a miniature snowman and allows families to leave and send voice messages through their phones.   Kaori Takahashi, 32, bought a Yukai robot-building kit for her six-year-old son to keep him occupied during the pandemic. Robots feel normal in everyday life because they are in so many Japanese children's films and cartoons, she said. \"I grew up watching anime shows 'The Astro Boy Essays' and 'Doraemon', which both feature robots, and my children love them too.\" Studies have shown that therapeutic robot pets designed in Japan, such as fluffy mechanical seals, can bring comfort to dementia patients. But the makers of Lovot -- a robot the size of a small toddler, with big round eyes and penguin-like wings that flutter up and down -- think everyone can benefit from a bot that just wants to be loved.   It has more than 50 sensors and an internal heating system, making it warm to touch, which it reacts to with squeaks of joy. Manufacturer Groove X said monthly sales shot up more than tenfold after the coronavirus hit Japan. A single Lovot costs around $2,800, plus fees for maintenance and software -- but those without deep pockets can visit the \"Lovot Cafe\" near Tokyo instead. One customer there, 64-year-old Yoshiko Nakagawa, called out to one of the robots fondly by name, as if to a grandson. During Japan's virus state of emergency, the capital became \"stark and empty\", she said. \"We need time to heal ourselves after this bleak period. If I had one of these babies at home, the heartwarming feeling would probably do the trick.\"  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162905", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17342", "source": "scrapy"},

All stakeholders must be consulted before making sweeping decisions.\" \"On how many counts does GOI intend to play with the future of India's youth?\" he added. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also written to the education minister to consider the demands of students for cancelling the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams. Vadra said that its 'shocking' that the CBSE has decided to go ahead with exams despite parents expressing fears and 'apprehensions' about assembling at exam centres in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. She said these 'apprehensions' are not 'Unreasonable', so exams should be cancelled. She, in her letter said, \"It will be practically impossible to ensure the safety of students at large and at crowded exam centres. Additionally, given the nature and the spread of the virus, it is not just the students who will be at risk but also their teachers, invigilators and family members who are in contact with them. Aside from this, by forcing the children to sit for these exams during a raging pandemic, the Government and the CBSE board will be held responsible in the event that any of the exam centres prove to be hotspots at which large numbers of children become infected with the disease.\" The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has also appealed to the Centre to take a uniform decision on the board exams of Classes 10 and 12 across the country in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A unilateral decision by any state would lead to students of that state being at a disadvantage in terms of career and opportunities, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said in a letter, dated April 10, addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. \"Your intervention would mean national consensus, instead of a unilateral decision by any particular state,\" Sawant said in his letter. The exams are due in a few days which will put several students and their families, teachers and non-teaching staff at high risk, he said. According to the revised date sheet for CBSE board exams 2021, the Class 10 exams would be held between May 4 and June 7 and those for Class 12 would be held between May 4 and June 15.

He has set up a website for the same, and has been directing them to clinics and hospitals that are in dire need of expertise. California will reactivate the medical licences of retired healthcare workers, while giving fresh licences to students.   “If you’re a nursing school student, a medical school student, we need you,” Newsom said. “If you’ve just retired in the last couple of years, we need you.” California, as part of its “California Health Corps” is inducting more staff into the state medical machinery.

During one of his daily briefings, Governor Andrew Cuomo claimed that the state has enough ventilators to last six days. Additionally, he claimed that the federal government will not be able to provide the number of ventilators needed in the coming days. As masks also increasingly run out in New York City, the mayor Bill De Blasio has requested citizens to make masks at home, or to simply cover using a cloth to limit spreading the virus. “When you put on that face covering, you’re protecting everyone else,” he said. He requested the people to wear anything ranging from a scarf to a bandanna. He further added to avoid wearing surgical masks which are in shortage and are required by healthcare workers on the frontline. A recent study in Singapore claims that over 10 per cent of infections are spread by people who carry the virus but do not experience symptoms. Since then, the American approach has changed from only-wear-masks-if-you’re-sick to everybody-needs masks. As the US cases approach 215,000, the death toll has increased to 5,000. Recently, the state had released 400 ventilators for use by New York City. As of now, the state stockpile has over 2,200 ventilators and more will be released to the city based on the need. According to Cuomo, over 350 people come to hospitals everyday seeking assistance in breathing. The state of New York has recorded 2,373 deaths alone. The number was 1,941 yesterday. The state is being dubbed as the American epicentre of the virus, as it accounts for nearly half of the coronavirus-related deaths in the entire country.   According to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, global deaths have now surpassed 50,000, while over 1 million people have now tested positive for the virus. However, New York is also witnessing a high discharge rate, as is the rest of the US, if compared to other countries.  To meet the increasing demand, New York has constructed makeshift hospitals at the Javits centre and the Brooklyn cruise terminal to increase the bed capacity. “Beds we can find,” Cuomo said. “The harder component is the staff and the supplies.”  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/24/134168-untitled-design-5.jpg?itok=luBE261P\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162909", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21866", "source": "scrapy"},

Ron DeSantis' roundtable discussion last month.", "text": "Video of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and a panel of scientists apparently trading in Covid-19 misinformation has been pulled from YouTube. The video of DeSantis’ roundtable discussion last month at the state Capitol in Tallahassee was removed on Wednesday because it violated the social media platform’s standards, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said. It had been embedded in a Tampa-area   and it's removal was flagged by the  , a \"free market\" think tank based in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. “YouTube has clear  to support the health and safety of our users,” Hernandez said in a statement. “We removed AIER’s video because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19.” Hernandez said YouTube only allows videos “that otherwise   to remain on the platform if they contain sufficient educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context.” “Our policies apply to everyone and focus on content regardless of the speaker or channel,” Hernandez said. DeSantis's press secretary Cody McCloud called YouTube's move \"another blatant example of Big Tech attempting to silence those who disagree with their woke corporate agenda.\" \"YouTube claimed they removed the video because 'it contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities,' yet this roundtable was led by world-renowned doctors and epidemiologists from Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard, all of whom are eminently qualified to speak on the global health crisis,\" McCloud said. \"Good public health policy should include a variety of scientific and technical expertise, and YouTube’s decision to remove this video suppresses productive dialogue of these complex issues.\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, one of the scientists on the panel, said this \"was a policy forum, in which it is appropriate to consider both the benefits and costs of a policy (child masking) when making judgments and recommendations.\" \"YouTube’s censorship of our discussion is contrary to American democratic norms of free expression,\" the professor said in an email. \"It is also a violation of basic standards of scientific conduct, which stand in opposition to unreasoned silencing of contrary views and require the free exchange of ideas.\" Earlier, AIER editorial director Jeffrey A. Tucker insisted  Wednesday on the think tank’s website that YouTube censored DeSantis and the scientists and called it “the latest attack on public health information.” Many public health experts, however, have accused Bhattacharya and the other scientists on the panel with DeSantis — former Trump White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Scott Atlas; epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta; and Dr. Martin Kulldorff — of spreading public health misinformation. NBC News has also reached out to Tucker, Atlas, Gupta and Kulldorff for comment. NBC News did not see the video before it was removed. Tucker first reported its removal. But based on a transcript provided by YouTube, it appears the participants ran afoul of the platform’s standards when DeSantis asked whether children in school should be wearing masks and Kulldorff replied, “Uh, children should not wear face masks, no. They don’t need it for their own protection, and they don’t need it for protecting other people either.” Less than a minute later, Bhattacharya chimed-in, saying that mask-wearing “is developmentally inappropriate and it just doesn’t help on the disease spread.” “There’s no scientific rationale or logic to have children wear masks in school,” Atlas said six minutes later. That language also appears in the   with his article. Those claims run counter to the recommendations of the federal  , which advises that “people age 2 and older should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household.” The  recommendations are a bit looser for younger children, but kids age 12 and over “should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults.” All the scientists in the video but Atlas are signatories to  , which was   and which opposed lockdowns and argued that society would build herd immunity against Covid-19 if all but people over age 70 “resume life as normal.” Atlas, who is  , was especially  to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Many of the world’s leading scientists denounced The Great Barrington Declaration as a “ unsupported by scientific evidence.” And later, then-President Donald Trump’s CDC chief, Dr. Robert Redfield, was overhead by NBC saying of Atlas, “Everything he says is false.” The Trump administration  , as did DeSantis, who was criticized by public health experts for being   and for reopening the state too soon. Most of the Covid-19 deaths and cases were recorded in Florida after DeSantis visited Trump in the White House last April and prematurely, as it turned out, declared  . As of Friday, Florida had reported more than 2 million Covid-19 infections and nearly 35,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to  . It also has the tenth highest Covid-19 infection rate in the country, according to  . DeSantis in the AIER transcript agreed with his panelists that lockdowns were ineffective at stopping the pandemic, saying \"there’s really not a lot of positive to balance it out when you compare the severe lockdown states to other states which weren’t locked down or other countries like Sweden, which had adopted a different approach.\" Sweden   but began imposing restrictions about six months ago after the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths soared,  .", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3463503/210409-ron-desantis-ew-140p_3a4ec2798dd5ef0c3f054116eb5caf60.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Holds News Conference In Miami\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162905", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "44440", "source": "scrapy"},

Hundreds of thousands of people in the Arab world are turning to Clubhouse, the fast-growing audio chat app, to mock and vent against longtime rulers, debate sensitive issues from abortion to sexual harassment, or argue where to find the best and cheapest shawarma sandwich during an economic crisis. The discussions are endless as they are breathless. More than 970,000 people from the Middle East have downloaded the new platform since it launched outside the U.S. in January. It has offered space for in-person conversations in an age where direct contact is at the mercy of the pandemic and it’s brought together those at home and the many in exile or abroad. But mostly, it has offered a release for bottled-up frustration in a region where violent conflicts and autocrats have taken hold and where few, if any, avenues for change — or even for speaking out — seem tenable. “It is an open coffeehouse that pierces through what is forbidden by the political regimes in the region,” said Diana Moukalled, a Lebanese journalist who closely follows social platforms. “Clubhouse has made people go back to debating one another.” The Middle East accounts for 6.1 percent of the 15.9 million global downloads of Clubhouse, which launched in the United States a year ago. Saudi Arabia ranks no. 7 globally for the invitation-only downloads, with over 660,000, just after Thailand and before Italy, according to San Francisco-based mobile app analytics firm Sensor Tower. One reason for its popularity seems to be the no-holds-barred atmosphere, fueled by the liveliness of group conversation. Saudis organized rooms to discuss who could replace their aging king instead of his ambitious son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They argued with Egyptians over what they considered democracy and with Lebanese and Jordanians over their kingdom’s perceived meddling in their affairs. Other rooms tackle taboo topics ranging from atheism to homosexuality. A Saudi woman discussed whether abortions should be allowed in the kingdom, prompting a heated back and forth. The platform also became a place to exchange information, challenging the region’s largely state-dominated media. Minutes after reports of an attempted coup in Jordan last week, Jordanians inside and outside the country congregated in a room to share information on the confusing reports released and controlled by the government. Families of those arrested in the ensuing sweep shared their news. Some users defended King Abdullah while backers of the brother prince accused of the coup vowed to rally behind him. Previously unimaginable debates took place among parts of society who would otherwise shun or block each other on other social media. Opponents debated supporters of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group. Elsewhere, Lebanese railed against private banks they blame for their country’s economic meltdown — with bankers in the room. In another room, Iraqis — mainly exiles — criticized how their country’s many religious militias impacted their lives. The moderator, a woman from the southern Shiite city of Najaf now living in Europe, told how her conservative family tried to mold her into “being like them” and opposed sending her to universities where men and women mingle. She fended off one man who suggested she was exaggerating, telling him he hadn’t experienced what she did. The moderator went on and named figures from powerful Shiite militias and religious leaders, saying she’d seen how they flout the rules they set for others. In the free-flowing conversation, militia supporters frequently interrupted, sparking a torrent of expletives from the moderator and others until they were forced to leave. “They controlled the ground with their muscles,” the moderator said of the militias. “But social media need brains. This (space) is ours.” Among the hundreds of rooms discussing the war in Syria, some users decided to lighten the mood. Opposition activists organized a spoof interview with someone posing as President Bashar Assad. It drew laughs but also poignant reminders of how the 10-year conflict devastated the country. “I ran away from you and still you follow me to Clubhouse,” one exiled Syrian told the fake “Assad.” But concerns are mounting that the open space could quickly come under the same government surveillance or censorship as other social media. A decade ago, activists in the Arab Spring protests flocked to Twitter and Facebook, which offered a similar free space. Since then, authorities have come to use the sites to target and arrest critics and spread their own propaganda. Oman has already blocked the Clubhouse app. In Jordan, it is obstructed on certain mobile networks, while in the United Arab Emirates, users have described unexplainable glitches. Pro-government commentators have railed against Clubhouse in TV shows and newspapers, accusing it of helping terrorists plan attacks, spreading pornography or undermining religious and state figures. First, Clubhouse drew rights defenders and political activists. Then came the government backers. “This room has grown because Salman’s people are here to defend him,” shouted a participant in a room featuring opponents of the Saudi crown prince. A discussion of the release of imprisoned Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul’s devolved into panicked mayhem when a few participants threatened to expose attendees and report them to authorities. The chat soon cut off. Recordings surfaced online from Clubhouse conversations deemed offensive, such as about homosexuality becoming acceptable, fueling fears that pro-government Saudi users were keeping tabs on critics. One participant asked to leave a chat among Lebanese when it was discovered she was Israeli, in part because some users feared they could be prosecuted under Lebanese laws banning mixing with Israelis. Some fear security agents are secretly in the rooms. Most participants in the app, which remains exclusive to iPhone users, use real names and sometimes put detailed bios. But growing numbers use fake names. Without anonymity, Clubhouse disagreements could turn into violence in real life, said Ali Sibai, a consultant with Beirut-based digital rights group Social Media Exchange, SMEX. Clubhouse’s “vague” policies also raise concerns, he said. The company says it temporarily stores conversations for investigating abuses. But it doesn’t say for how long or who reviews the Arabic content, raising questions whether unknown third parties may be involved, endangering participants’ security, he said. Moukalled, editor of Daraj, an independent online media, said it would be no surprise if authorities impose surveillance on Clubhouse. But, she said, something else would come along. “So long as people don’t feel they are part of the decision-making process, they will find these platforms.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/rockcms/2021-04/918/210409-clubhouse-app-al-1201-3a94fb_4f2406532eabed7266e7b8828c7f4aa9aba2a8ea.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Clubhouse App\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162909", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Both brought up their fifties and after settling down took the attack to the KKR bowlers. However, Bairstow got restless after playing three dots in the 13th over bowled by Pat Cummins and he hit straight into the hands of the backward point fielder.  The wicket came at the right moment for the KKR but wrong for the SRH as they just started to amp up towards the 188-run target on a slowish pitch.

The seizures announced Monday were conducted during a three-month operation that centered around Lwe Kham village in Kutkhai Township in Myanmar's northeast Shan state. Thirty-three suspects were arrested. Jeremy Douglas, the regional coordinator for the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), said \"what has been unearthed through this operation is truly off-the-charts.\" Police seized nearly 200 million methamphetamine tablets, more than 500 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine, and 35.5 metric tons and 163,000 thousand liters of precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs, Myanmar authorities and the UNODC said in a joint statement. They also seized nearly 3,750 liters (990 gallons) of liquid methylfentanyl, which is used to make a powerful synthetic opioid like fentanyl.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) described the haul as one of the largest and most successful counter-narcotics operations in the history of the region. \r\n The production network could have been possible only with the backing of serious transnational criminal groups, he added. The raids unearthed “unprecedented” methyl fentanyl, the sign of a new trend of synthetic opioid production emerging “on a scale nobody anticipated”, said Douglas. Fifty times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl can be lethal from as little as two milligrams, the equivalent of a few grains of sand. It has fuelled an opioid crisis in the US that killed 32,000 people in 2018. \r\n Myanmar is under pressure to stem the deluge of drugs from its border regions. Shan state is part of the ''Golden Triangle'', a wedge of land cutting into Myanmar, Laos, China and Thailand and virtually untroubled by authorities despite the multi-billion dollar trade. Myanmar is the world’s second-biggest producer of heroin after Afghanistan, and is now widely thought to be the largest global source of meth, fuelled by the flood of precursor chemicals from China.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/05/19/141003-1280.jpg?itok=e1VUNUIe\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162909", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22088", "source": "scrapy"},

Laxman talks about how his players are upbeat and looking forward to an exciting tournament. “The boys just had a go at the nets and it’s been pretty good,” Laxman shares. “Most of the Indian players played domestic cricket (Vijay Hazare tourney) while the foreign players played for their respective national sides. So we are trying to capitalise this entire week for our practice sessions.” Even so, IPL for Laxman has always been such a tournament in which the players have to gel well as a team. “And the good thing is that we [SRH] always played well as a cohesive unit and that’s been our strength,” he states, adding, “In fact, we are one of the most consistent teams in the last few years.”   Having retained their core group for the 2021 season, SRH looks strong in batting with the likes of David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy, Kane Williamson, Manish Padey, etc. So too, Laxman is quite certain that SRH has the potential to beat any side. But added to the confidence in his team members’ performance is his assurance that the team has taken back lessons from IPL’s last season in Dubai. “I think overall it’s important to get a good quick breakthroughs. I believe winning crucial moments is significant,” he states. The franchise has, nevertheless, been criticised for depending heavily on the top order. But Laxman is undeterred by the talk and says that the team has players who can strengthen middle order too.   “This season players such as Kedar Jadhav will boost our depth in the batting; his experience will not only add diversity but also strike a balance in the line-up,” assures the former India cricketer. The batting great further revels in the fact that the team has got players who can perform in any conditions. None of his confidence in his team, however, means he is blinded to their weaknesses, the mark of a true mentor. “An area we need to work on is to maintain the positive frame of mind and attitude of the players when they are part of the bubble for a long time.”   Laxman is also convinced that as the players have been part of the bio bubble in the earlier series too, getting into the groove will not be so difficult. \r\nEven as the IPL time is being held in India this year, the Hyderabadi batsman is aware that the strategy for tourneys of such magnitude keeps changing. “Strategies change according to the situations, conditions, pitch, opposition, etc. But luckily we’ve got players who can execute strategies even in the toughest conditions. So winning the tournament is all about seizing the momentum early and sustaining it. And for this, players have to be consistent and tough — physically and mentally tough.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162908", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16913", "source": "scrapy"},

Here are some gentle ways to ward off an episode or at least reduce the distress   A migraine is an episodic debilitating headache requiring long-term management. Experts say yoga exercises, deep breathing and meditation have been proven to reduce stress, one of the main triggers of these headaches. The intensity of the pain is reduced as certain exercises help boost circulation and improve blood flow to the brain, says yoga expert Mansi Gulati. She lists a few exercises that can help relieve migraines, and explains why they’re so beneficial.   \r\nThis allows you to ‘squeeze’ out the tension and focus on balance, alleviate stress and improve concentration. It gives all of your facial muscles a workout. \r\nSteps \r\nl Squeeze your face and hold it for 10 second, keeping the breath normal; then release the muscles. \r\nNo matter how much tension you hold in your face and neck and how much tightness you feel in these parts of your body, facial yoga will relax you within a few seconds.   \r\nThis exercise uses acupressure to remove tension at key points on your forehead. Touching these pressure point can relieve headaches that are caused by eyestrain and sinus pain or pressure. With consistent practice, this relaxing movement will help prevent wrinkles and smooth any persistent forehead lines too. \r\n \r\nl Fist your hands and place them at the centre of your forehead. \r\nl Apply pressure using your middle and index finger knuckles. \r\nl Maintain pressure as you slowly slide your fists to either side. \r\nl End at your temples, gently applying more pressure. \r\nl Repeat four times. \r\nThe point of the ‘third eye’ can be found between your eyebrows, where the bridge of your nose meets your forehead. Firm pressure applied to this pressure point is thought to relieve eyestrain and sinus pressure that often cause migraine attacks. \r\n \r\nUse the index finger of one hand to apply firm pressure to this area for 1 minute.   \r\nA backward bending asana, it gives a nice stretch to your stomach and thighs while strengthening your back and providing relief from the migraine. \r\n \r\nl Stand on the knees. Keep knees and feet together. \r\nl Lean backward. \r\nl Push the hips forward. \r\nl Bend the head and the spine as far back as possible without straining. \r\nl Relax the body and the muscles of the back. \r\nThis will help you slow down your thoughts, become conscious of your breath and pay more attention to your body. It calms your brain and nervous system. \r\n \r\nl Rub your hands together, generating heat in your palms; then place the base of your palms on your eyes. \r\nl Stay like that and breathe. \r\nl Hold the position for 30 seconds.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162908", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16817", "source": "scrapy"},

The study, carried out by the University of Sheffield in the UK, is the largest global review of factors associated with distress amongst health care workers during an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19, SARS, bird flu, swine flu and Ebola.   Researchers assessed fixed factors such as demographic characteristics, age, sex and occupation as well as social psychological and infection-related factors in more than 143,000 health care workers from around the world. The review of 139 studies included data collected between 2000 and November 2020. Consistent evidence indicated that being female, a nurse, experiencing stigma and having contact or risk of contact with infected patients were the biggest risk factors for psychological distress among health care workers,\" Dr Fuschia Sirois, Reader in Social and Health Psychology in the university and lead author of the study, said. By analysing data from previous infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS, bird flu and swine flu, it appears that distress for health care workers can persist for up to three years after the initial outbreak.   As the world continues to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic it is so important that we identify the health care workers who are most at risk for distress and the factors that can be modified to reduce distress and improve resilience, Sirois said. The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry, have informed a new framework which health care providers can use to identify those most at risk of increased distress, as well as areas to target to help build resilience. This framework can help guide early interventions and ongoing monitoring. Personal and organisational social support, feeling in control, sufficient information about the outbreak and proper protection, training and resources, were associated with less psychological distress.   It was interesting to see that factors such as age didn't appear to have a significant impact - even during COVID-19. In some studies, older people weren't distressed - perhaps because they had worked as health care professionals for many years and therefore felt more equipped in dealing with an outbreak, whereas younger people who are physically less likely to be affected by the infectious disease tended to be less experienced in dealing with an outbreak professionally, therefore causing them to be more distressed, Sirois said. Social aspects also affected people differently - people certainly benefited from having a social support network. However, living with a partner or children caused increased stress for many who were scared about passing on the infection.   Dr Sirois and a team from the University of Sheffield and the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust are now conducting a further study with National Health Service (NHS) workers using this new framework in order to help identify factors which could help to reduce distress during COVID-19. The Department of Psychology at the University of Sheffield is focused on exploring the science behind the human brain and human behaviour. Researchers cover a wide range of topics, ranging from the intricacies of neural networks and brain function, to the developmental, biological and social mechanisms that shape who we are, to increasing our understanding of physical and mental health issues, and how we can treat them.   Researchers apply a variety of research methods and use a range of specialist research facilities to understand human behaviour, thinking, interaction, and health problems.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162910", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16686", "source": "scrapy"},

After decades of a \"one-child policy\", Beijing changed the rules in 2016 to allow families to have two children as fears grew about China's fast-ageing population and shrinking workforce.   Figures from the Public Security Ministry released on Monday showed that the number of registered births fell to 10.04 million in 2020, a drop of more than 30 percent from the previous year. It marked the fourth consecutive year that figure has declined. The gender balance was 52.7 percent boys and 47.3 percent girls, according to the official data. China introduced the one-child policy in the late 1970s in a dramatic effort to slow rapid population growth, before reversing it in 2016. But the change has not yet resulted in a baby boom, with empowered Chinese women often delaying or avoiding childbirth and young couples blaming rising costs and insufficient policy support for families.   In November, China started a once-a-decade census, with much of the attention on whether it indicates any population bump from the relaxation of family planning rules. Demographic experts have estimated it could take 15 years for the two-child policy to have any noticeable effect on population numbers. Chinese retirees, meanwhile, are expected to number 300 million by 2025.

The worst-affected was New Delhi, the most polluted capital on Earth, where around 54,000 deaths are estimated to have occurred due to hazardous PM2.5 airborne particles, according to a report from Greenpeace Southeast Asia.   In Tokyo, the figure was 40,000 with the rest spread across Shanghai, Sao Paulo and Mexico City, according to the report, which looked at the impact of microscopic PM2.5 matter produced by burning fossil fuels. \"When governments choose coal, oil and gas over clean energy, it's our health that pays the price,\" said Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner at Greenpeace India. PM2.5 particles are considered the most harmful for health. They damage the heart and lungs, and increase the chances of severe asthma attacks. Some studies have linked PM2.5 exposure to a higher risk of dying from Covid-19. The report used an online tool that estimates the impacts of PM 2.5 by taking air quality data from monitoring site IQAir and combining it with scientific risk models, as well as population and health data.   The tool is a collaboration between Greenpeace, IQAir, and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Despite the high numbers of deaths, coronavirus lockdowns imposed across the world -- that took traffic off the streets and shut down polluting industries -- did temporarily clear the skies above big cities. Delhi, for instance, underwent a dramatic transformation for a period last year when curbs were imposed, with residents revelling in azure skies and clean air. Scientists say that massive drops in some pollutants due to lockdowns are bound to have prevented deaths. Nevertheless, Greenpeace urged governments to put investment in renewable energy at the heart of plans to recover from the pandemic-triggered economic downturn.   \"To really clean up our air, governments must stop building new coal plants, retire existing coal plants, and invest in clean energy generation, such as wind and solar,\" said the group's air pollution scientist Aidan Farrow.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162910", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16287", "source": "scrapy"},

The seizures announced Monday were conducted during a three-month operation that centered around Lwe Kham village in Kutkhai Township in Myanmar's northeast Shan state. Thirty-three suspects were arrested. Jeremy Douglas, the regional coordinator for the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), said \"what has been unearthed through this operation is truly off-the-charts.\" Police seized nearly 200 million methamphetamine tablets, more than 500 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine, and 35.5 metric tons and 163,000 thousand liters of precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs, Myanmar authorities and the UNODC said in a joint statement. They also seized nearly 3,750 liters (990 gallons) of liquid methylfentanyl, which is used to make a powerful synthetic opioid like fentanyl.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) described the haul as one of the largest and most successful counter-narcotics operations in the history of the region. \r\n The production network could have been possible only with the backing of serious transnational criminal groups, he added. The raids unearthed “unprecedented” methyl fentanyl, the sign of a new trend of synthetic opioid production emerging “on a scale nobody anticipated”, said Douglas. Fifty times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl can be lethal from as little as two milligrams, the equivalent of a few grains of sand.

Diwali, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Eid, Christmas, and Kumbh Mela, the mother of all festivals, are clearly not enough. We probably have the most literary festivals in the world. Other countries have run-of-the-mill elections. India,   and   has a “festival of democracy” Therefore it’s hardly surprising that in the middle of the second wave of   , the prime minister wants the good citizens of India to have themselves a   or a vaccination festival. In his speech, Narendra Modi suggested that a   between 11 and 14 April could boost the vaccination drive. Also, 11 April happens to be the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotiba Phule while 14 April is that of Babasaheb Ambedkar. This could be some strategist’s brainwave of killing two birds with one jab. One year ago as India went into lockdown the prime minister had other festive ideas to raise our spirits - we clanged pots and pans, blew conch shells, lit divas. There were even WhatsApp forwards about how that vibration was going to destroy the virus. One year later the virus is rampaging through the country in its second wave, those WhatsApp forwarders have move on to other causes and we have upped the game from pots and pans and candles to a full-fledged festival. Cynics might roll their eyes but the prime minister knows that as soon as it’s called a festival it becomes a red-letter day in our minds. Amazon and Flipkart can do “Tika Utsav” bumper sales starting on 12:01 am on 11 April until 11:59 pm on 14 April. Pizza Hut can deliver Tika Utsav special pizzas - with tika kebab toppings of course. Each city can have friendly contests to see which centre doles out the most shots in one day, that’s vaccine shots, not alcoholic ones. Anything that encourages vaccination is of course something to be encouraged. And the prime minister is in his own way a cheerleader-in-chief for the nation. Thus he is to be commended for trying to encourage all eligible Indians to go out and get vaccinated. And if some upbeat festival messaging works better than doom-and-gloom portents so be it. Of course, there is a danger that in the rush to celebrate tika utsavs, we could crowd vaccination centres and forget about social distancing but that’s a minor quibble. But what feels incongruous is this cheery PSA for a “festival of vaccination” occurs at the same time as a “festival of democracy” is unfolding in so many states across India. The pandemic and the election seem to be occurring in different worlds, hermetically sealed from each other. There are two Indias, one in which a   second wave is raging and one in which elections are happening and apparently never the twain shall meet. Mind you this is a country where a court rules that you can be fined for not wearing your mask while alone in your car. A vehicle is a “public place” says the Delhi High Court but a political rally is obviously not. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan recently scolded his fellow citizens for letting down their guard and allowing the Covid numbers to explode afresh. He blamed “lack of commitment and sincerity” and said, “nobody is interested in wearing the mask.. there’s no respect for the norms of physical distancing.” , the same minister shared pictures of his party leaders holding election rallies where hardly anyone was wearing a mask and there was certainly no physical distancing happening. “One look at Harsh Vardhan’s Twitter feed makes it quite clear who could be called out “for taking everything casually’” writes Rohan Venkataramakrishnan in  . It’s not a BJP problem. It’s a problem pretty much across the political spectrum. Old habits die hard. Old electioneering habits die especially hard. Photographs from rallies across Bengal for example, whether Trinamool or BJP or the Left Front-Congress combine, would hardly suggest the country is grappling with a pandemic. It looks just like something from five years ago. Perhaps the fact that the Bihar elections did not cause a huge explosion in infections lulled us into a false sense of complacency. But these elections are happening in the middle of a certified second wave. Yet the same politicians who wag their fingers at the public for giving safety precautions a “tilanjali” seem to have no interest in leading by example. And they do not even see the jarring dissonance. It is obviously not easy in a country like India to do physical distancing at the best of times, let alone at election time. But we can do our bit. The symbolism matters. Though Donald Trump sneered at Joe Biden for wearing a mask during his campaign, Biden resolutely stuck to it. The open-air inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with the guests wearing masks sent out two messages - one, that the business of democracy and transition of power must go one and two, they must go on with as much safety precautions as possible in these grave times. It was about fortitude in face of a pandemic not the denial of it. It will never be foolproof but the message is important. The visual of masked politicians on stage at an election rally in India would send out a message as well. A top political leader taking his mask off to address the rally and then putting it back on would send out a message. Similarly, a crowded stage filled with maskless jostling politicians sends out its own message to the rank and file. A political candidate in Kolkata told reporters asking him about lack of masks and safety norms that he was “not afraid” of the virus and he would win, Covid or no Covid. Tirath Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand tells devotees planning to attend Mahakumbh that “nobody will be stopped in the name of   ” because “faith is stronger than fear”. Two days later he tested positive. At this point it’s baffling that politicians still think bravado is the vaccine we all need. Now the Haridwar district magistrate has said all schools in the district will remain closed from 9 to 15 April not because of   fears but “in view of a huge rush of devotees to Kumbh Mela.”    It’s clear that after a year everyone is suffering from Covid safety exhaustion. The masks are slipping and weddings and parties are back and public transport is crowded. We read about rising numbers and lack of beds but there’s no indication that it’s affecting our behaviour. A video of a cheerful woman at a temple during Holi telling a reporter there was no Covid there recently went viral. Despite Yogi Adityanath’s strongman reputation in Uttar Pradesh, his exhortation to maintain safety protocols during Holi seemed to fall on many deaf ears. People are tired of a year of safety protocols or lulled by the dip in numbers at the end of 2020 or both. But now that the second wave has truly landed, mixed messages from the political leaders do not help. While the PM exhorts us to not let down our guard, we just hear \"no lockdown\". The prime minister in his message about the second wave has reiterated the focus needs to be on “test, track, treat, Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid management”. That’s commendable. But perhaps the time has come for politicians of all parties, not just the aam aadmi, to also exhibit that “Covid-appropriate behaviour”. And if we must turn everything into a festival, what about a month-long “mask festival” instead of just a tika one?", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" alt=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tamil-nadu-election_BJP_PTI_640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162914", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "47301", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.financialexpress.com", "section": "Infrastructure", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/airlines-aviation/after-staying-grounded-for-nearly-two-years-boeing-737-max-aircraft-returns-to-the-skies-details/2229131/", "title": "After staying grounded for nearly two years, Boeing 737 Max aircraft returns to the skies; details", "author": null, "author_link": "https://www.financialexpress.com/author/devanjana-nag/", "published_date": "April 8, 2021 10:51 AM", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "In the month of October 2018, the newest member of Boeing’s 737 narrow-body family- 737 Max crashed in the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia.", "text": "", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://images.financialexpress.com/2021/04/Boeing-737-Max-1200.jpg\" alt=\"Boeing 737 Max, aircraft\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162905", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "29513", "source": "scrapy"},

In yet another major development in the rape case against ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath, the victim has written to Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Police Commissioner alleging failure by the police to arrest him.  The letter written by the victim and addressed to Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava and Home Minister Amit Shah also questioned why the prosecution had failed to demand his presence at the time of filing an anticipatory bail application by the accused.  “This shocking degree of insensitivity towards my case is deeply distressing, and also makes me understand the true reason as to why so many rape victims in our country choose to suffer in silence, rather than to seek justice against their perpetrators,” said the victim in her letter, a copy of which is accessed by India Legal. The letter comes two days after the Delhi High Court granted interim protection from arrest to ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath in a case registered against him under charges of rape. A single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta on April 9 granted the relief, however, she clarified that the same would only be provided if Hiremath joins the investigation. Mumbai-based ET Now Anchor Varun Hiremath has been accused of raping a 22-year-old Pune-based woman in New Delhi. The journalist was anticipating arrest in connection with the FIR lodged by the woman in Chanakyapuri Police station under sec. 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint, the woman had alleged that she was raped by Hiremath in ITC Maurya Hotel in Chanakyapuri. However, Hiremath denied the allegation as false and frivolous as the FIR was registered after a delay of 3 days i.e on 23rd February 2021. Thereafter, Hiremath moved the Bombay High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail which was rejected last month. While rejecting the plea, Justice P.D. Naik observed that the applicant is charged under Section 376 of IPC, hence, the court is not inclined to grant such relief in this case. However, the applicant may approach the appropriate court, the Judge had said. Later, a Delhi court had also refused the anticipatory bail application of Hiremath, while observing that if the woman states in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent. The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Khanagwal.  \n \n \n   \n \n", "image_url": "<img width=\"694\" height=\"503\" class=\"entry-thumb\" src=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1.jpg 694w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-300x217.jpg 300w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-579x420.jpg 579w, https://d2r2ijn7njrktv.cloudfront.net/IL/uploads/2021/04/11164142/Varun-Hiremath-1-324x235.jpg 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" alt=\"\" title=\"Varun-Hiremath\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162904", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Greg Abbott about why he had attacked the Biden administration over reports of sexual assault at a migrant shelter despite being silent on the matter when   was in office. Abbott, a Republican,   Wednesday that his state had received complaints of sexual abuse at a federal facility that houses migrant youth. Abbott blamed President  ’s immigration policies and called for the facility to be shut down. But immigrant advocates condemned Abbott’s press conference as political theater, noting that he failed to speak up over   at immigrant detention centers during the Trump administration. “Governor, there were thousands of complaints of sexual assault at migrant shelters during the Trump years,” Wallace said   with Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” “Not to say that what’s going on now is right, but we couldn’t find one instance of you complaining and calling that out when President Trump was president.” Abbott said there were “multiple differences” between how the Trump and Biden administrations handled the alleged sexual abuse, including the “constant communication” his office received from Trump officials on the matter. He went on to suggest that he was fully aware of the migrant sexual assault allegations during the Trump administration but didn’t speak out at the time because those complaints were filed with federal agencies. “The one that I talked about earlier this past week were reports that were filed with state agencies,” Abbott said. “So we have a duty to respond to any complaint about child sexual abuse as well as to investigate it and that’s exactly what I did to make sure it was addressed.” “Don’t fall prey to Democrats or others saying, ‘Well, Abbott didn’t complain about this in the past,’” he added. “What they need to focus on is exactly what I called attention to last month in Dallas, Texas, where I pointed out then that there were going to be instances of child sex abuse taking place.” The sex abuse Abbott cited Wednesday allegedly took place at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. More than 1,300 teens who crossed the border into the U.S. from Mexico without a parent or guardian are reportedly being held there. “In short, this facility is a health and safety nightmare,” Abbott told reporters Wednesday. “The Biden administration is now presiding over the abuse of children.” From 2014 to 2018, under the Obama administration and subsequent Trump presidency, the Department of Health and Human Services received more than 4,500 complaints of sexual harassment and abuse against government-run migrant shelters,  . “The only reason why Abbott is now acting like he cares about the children in these facilities is for political reasons,” Jonathan Ryan, CEO of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, said in a statement. “What the governor wants is for the Biden administration to stop allowing children to seek home and safety in this country,” Ryan added. “That is not the solution to the challenge we have in front of us.

About 40% of white evangelical Protestants said they likely would not get vaccinated, according to  , compared to about 25% of all Americans, 28% of white mainline Protestants and 27% of Protestants who are not white.  “I’ve heard people I care about saying, you know, ‘If I’m faithful, God’s going to take care of me,’” Buttigieg said. “And I guess what I would hope that they might consider is that maybe a vaccine is part of God’s plan for how you’re going to take care of yourself.” Buttigieg acknowledged during the exchange on CNN that his opinion on the matter may not sway many white evangelicals, and he urged faith leaders to speak out in support of vaccines. “In the end, I have to admit that it’s unlikely that an official like me is going to be persuasive to somebody who maybe doesn’t feel like Washington has been speaking to them for a long time,” Buttigieg said.  “The idea of pastoral care is about supporting those who look to you for guidance,” he added. “So I hope anybody who is looking after a community of people, including a faith community, will consider ways to help guide them toward steps that can protect them and protect those around them.” There are about 41 million white evangelical adults nationwide. Public health experts have warned that the group’s widespread reluctance to get vaccinated could prolong the pandemic. “If we can’t get a significant number of white evangelicals to come around on this, the pandemic is going to last much longer than it needs to,” Jamie Aten, founder and executive director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College, an evangelical institution in Illinois,  . Some white evangelicals have cited their religious beliefs in their refusal to get a vaccine, noting a remote connection between abortion and vaccine development. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain fetal tissue, but some were developed using cells derived from fetal tissue from elective abortions that took place decades ago, according to the Times. Other white evangelicals have pointed to their lack of trust in the government. “I just don’t really want to see the government or anybody force people to do something that those people feel like is not in their best interests,” a 49-year-old white evangelical man in Tennessee  . Public health experts largely consider COVID-19 vaccines to be   for ending the pandemic and returning to some sense of normalcy. Some high-profile conservative pastors, including Franklin Graham and Robert Jeffress, have publicly advocated for vaccination. But others have warned their followers against it.

The party’s bond with corporate America, however, is fraying. Fissures have burst open over the GOP’s embrace of conspiracy theories and rejection of mainstream climate science, as well as its dismissal of the 2020 election outcome. The most recent flashpoint was in Georgia, where a new Republican-backed law restricting voting rights   from Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, whose headquarters are in the state, and resulted in Major League Baseball pulling the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta. Republicans were furious. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned that their actions were   GOP strategists argued that they no longer needed corporate America’s money to win elections as they try to rebrand as a party of blue-collar workers. That extends an opportunity to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats to find an ally in an unlikely place when the party has unified control of the federal government for the first time in a decade. Biden is pushing an ambitious $2.3 trillion infrastructure package that includes corporate tax increases — which the White House is characterizing to CEOs as upfront investments that will ultimately make companies more profitable. “It’s important for making the country more competitive,” said Cedric Richmond, the White House’s director of public engagement. “We think the plan is so important to the country that we are advocating and singing its praises to all businesses.” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo estimates she has talked to more than 50 business leaders about the plan, including a round of Easter weekend phone calls. She is encouraging companies to focus on the entire package instead of the tax increases. “You can’t look at one piece of it and say that one number makes you walk away,” she said. “They say, ‘That’s fair. Let me think about it.’ That’s how they run their businesses.” Whether the corporate split with the GOP widens could help answer questions about the political direction of the country and the extent to which business can continue to influence Washington. “Nobody in the business community wants hostile communities, angry finger-pointing workforces and turbulent shareholder bases,” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management. “It makes your job so much harder to have every constituency group at war within themselves, which has become the hallmark of the GOP.” Corporate America’s marriage with Republicans has long been one of convenience, united by a belief in low taxes and the need to repeal regulations. But the relationship, already strained during Donald Trump’s presidency, has come under increasing pressure as companies take cultural stands. That Republicans and businesses report to increasingly distinct constituencies helps explain the tension. A solid majority of Republican voters are white (86%) and older than 50 (62%), according to APVoteCast, a national survey of the 2020 electorate. Yet figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that workers are more racially diverse and younger than the Republican base. James Bailey, a management professor at George Washington University, published an analysis last year that suggested people who identified as Democrats cared more about a company’s political activity than Republicans do. Of business people, he said the uproar over the Georgia voting law “is a great opportunity for them to get on board with the young socially active consumer and to do so without much cost.” Just as important, Democratic counties have become the primary engines for growth. The counties that backed Biden last year account for 71% of all U.S. economic activity, according to the Brookings Institution. Democrats say business are comfortable partnering with them to address longstanding issues such as infrastructure after a decade of congressional gridlock, even though companies dislike the possibility of footing the bill. “Responsible corporate leaders want economic growth and predictable, competent policy— that’s what Democrats are offering.” said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who is running the House Democrats’ campaign arm for the 2022 midterm elections. Many Republicans are exasperated by business’s efforts to woo consumers through liberal social politics. “They are never going to satisfy the demands of the left,” said Steven Law, a former attorney for the Chamber who now runs Senate Leadership Fund, a big-spending outside group aligned with McConnell. Meantime “they risk alienating their natural allies in the Republican Party.” Still, Republicans have been a major driver of the rift, looking to capitalize on the culture clash to turn out the party base in the next election. Early indicators suggest business could face blowback. Georgia’s Republican-controlled House voted to strip Delta of a tax break worth tens of millions of dollars annually for its criticism of the new restrictive law, which voting rights groups have excoriated as an attack on democracy. The intended punishment was rendered moot after the GOP Senate failed to take it up before the legislative session adjourned. Campaign finance disclosures suggest corporate America’s money doesn’t buy as much influence as it once did. Roughly a decade ago, donations from company-sponsored political action committees accounted for an important share of the fundraising pie. But it’s stagnated as a source of campaign cash, as court rulings enabled wealthy GOP activists to pour money into the political system. Just 10 GOP megadonors account for half of the giving to major super political action committees controlled by Republican congressional leaders since 2012, collectively pouring $541 million into the committees, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of donors who gave over $1,000. The megadonors also contributed twice as much as conventional PACs and other groups that represent a broad swath of corporate interests. Political spending by the Chamber has also dropped precipitously. After spending $29 million in 2016, mostly supporting Republicans and attacking Democrats, the group’s contributions dropped to $10.9 million in 2018, according to data from nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. In 2020,  , which Republicans saw as a betrayal. That’s diminished the group’s once unassailable standing with GOP congressional leaders. “There is absolutely no love lost for corporations, especially when they consistently weigh in on things they don’t understand,” said Josh Holmes, a political adviser to McConnell. “There’s no sympathy.” Common ground still exists between Republicans and business on the value of tax cuts. The Chamber and the Business Roundtable oppose raising the corporate rate to 28% from the 21% level set in 2017, as well as an enhanced global minimum tax. Yet both groups want government spending on infrastructure. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s chief policy officer, said the broader business community isn’t fully aligned with either party. But the hyperpartisan nature of today’s politics is creating pressure to choose one side. “It really causes people to want to sort everything into a red camp or a blue camp,” he said. “Businesses aren’t partisan. They aren’t Republicans or Democrats. They have to operate and function in divided governments, operate in states that are solid blue and solid red.” Republicans caution, however, that business faces considerable risk weighing in on hot-button disputes. “They ought to tread carefully because they risk getting into the middle of a culture war that will earn them no friends and a lot of enemies,” said Law, the McConnell ally.", "image_url": "<img class=\"image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/607316fa2100001c007eed39.jpg?cache=v9qmv89nid&amp;ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" alt=\"In this April 5, 2021, file photo Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., listens to a reporter's question during a ne\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162915", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "60578", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asianage.com:443", "section": "world", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asianage.com:443/world/africa/260321/over-200-vessels-blocked-as-maritime-traffic-jam-grows-outside-blocked-suez-canal.html", "title": null, "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "An initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause", "text": ": A maritime traffic jam grew to more than 200 vessels Friday outside the Suez Canal and some vessels began changing course as dredgers worked frantically to free a giant container ship that is stuck sideways in the waterway and disrupting global shipping. One salvage expert said freeing the cargo ship, the Ever Given, could take up to a week in the best-case scenario and warned of possible structural problems on the vessel as it remains wedged.   The Ever Given, owned by the Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK, got wedged Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. A team from Boskalis, a Dutch firm specializing in salvaging, is working with the canal authority. using tugboats and a specialized suction dredger that is trying to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the bow. Egyptian authorities have prohibited media access to the site. An attempt Friday to free it failed, said Bernhard Schulte Ship management, the technical manager of the Ever Given. Plans are in the works to pump water from interior spaces of the vessel, and two more tugs should arrive by Sunday, the company said.   The Suez Canal Authority said it welcomed international offers of help. A U.S. defense official said Washington has offered Egypt assistance, including possible naval aid, and they are in discussions about how best to help. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss aid that has not yet been finalized. The canal authority released a video showing Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei inspecting efforts to free the Ever Given and telling workers: “Good luck, God willing.” An initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause, the company said. GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, had previously said the ship had experienced a power blackout, but it did not elaborate.   Bernhard Schulte said two canal pilots had been aboard the ship when it got stuck. Such an arrangement is customary, but the ship’s captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel, according to shipping experts. In addition to the over 200 vessels waiting near the canal, more than 100 ships were en route to the waterway, according to the data firm Refinitiv. Apparently anticipating long delays, the owners of the stuck vessel diverted a sister ship, the Ever Greet, to head around Africa instead, according to satellite data. Others also are being diverted to avoid the canal. The liquid natural gas carrier Pan Americas changed course in the mid-Atlantic, now aiming south to go around the southern tip of Africa, according to satellite data from MarineTraffic.com.   About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil. The closure also could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Oil markets are absorbing the disruption for now, said analyst Toril Bosoni. “Oil inventories have been coming down but they are still relatively ample,” he told The Associated Press, adding that he believes the impact might be more pronounced in the tanker sector than in the oil industry. “We are not losing any oil supply but it will tie up tankers for longer if they have to go around” the tip of Africa, he said, which is roughly an additional two-week trip.   Freeing the Ever Given is “quite a challenge” and could take five days to a week, .Capt. Nick Sloane, a maritime salvage expert who led the high-profile effort to salvage the cruise ship Costa Concordia in 2012 told the AP. The Ever Given’s location, size and large amount of cargo make the operation more complex, Sloane said. The operation should focus initially on dredging the bank and sea floor around it to get it floating again, rather than unloading its cargo, which could take weeks. That’s because the clock is also ticking structurally for the vessel, he added. “The longer it takes, the worse the condition of the ship will become, because she’s slowly sagging,” said Sloane, vice president of the International Salvage Union. “So ships are designed to flex, but not to be kept at that position with a full load of cargo for weeks at a time. So it’s not an easy situation.”   International companies are preparing for the effect that the canal’s blockage will have on supply chains that rely on precise deliveries of goods. Singapore’s Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung said the country’s port should expect disruptions. “Should that happen, some draw down on inventories will become necessary,” he said on Facebook. The backlog of vessels could stress European ports and the international supply of containers, already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, according to IHS Markit, a business research group. It said 49 container ships were scheduled to pass through the canal in the week since the Ever Given became lodged.   The delay could also result in huge insurance claims by companies, according to Marcus Baker, global head of Marine & Cargo at the insurance broker Marsh, with a ship like the Ever Given usually covered at between $100 million to $200 million. Those trying to free the vessel want to avoid complications that could extend the canal closure, according to an Egyptian official at the canal authority. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to talk to journalists. Satellite and photos distributed by the canal authority show Ever Given’s bow touching the eastern wall, while its stern appeared lodged against the western wall.   The Ever Given was involved in an accident in northern Germany in 2019, when it ran into a small ferry moored on the Elbe River in Hamburg. No passengers were on the ferry at the time and there were no injuries, but it was seriously damaged. Hamburg prosecutors opened an investigation of the Ever Given’s captain and pilot on suspicion of endangering shipping traffic, but shelved it in 2020 for lack of evidence, spokeswoman Liddy Oechtering told The Associated Press. Oechtering also could not say what the investigation had determined the cause of the crash was, but officials at the time suggested that strong winds may have blown the slow moving cargo ship into the ferry.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162914", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18786", "source": "scrapy"},

PM Modi also revealed that he had participated in a “Satyagraha” in India in 1971 as a youth in support of Bangladesh’s struggle for independence and had even courted arrest and gone to jail. He recalled the atrocities and heinous crimes committed by the Pakistani Army in 1971 on the people of Bangladesh and said photographs of these did not let people sleep for days. The high-profile visit of PM Modi began on a stormy note, with four supporters of hardline Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam being shot dead after violence erupted at Hathazari, a rural town, according to international news agency reports from Dhaka. The four were apparently shot dead during protests being staged by the Islamist group against PM Modi’s visit. Ruhul Amin, the government administrator of Hathazari town, told news agency AFP that upto 1,500 supporters of the hardline group attacked a police station chanting anti-Modi slogans. Other reports said hundreds of protesters also staged protests outside Dhaka’s Baitul Mokarram Mosque to oppose the visit, resulting in clashes and injuries after they attacked the Police.   Meanwhile, in a special gesture, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Ministers from her cabinet welcomed PM Modi at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on his arrival in Dhaka earlier in the day. A salute of 19 guns and Guard of honour were accorded to PM Modi. The Bangladesh PM praised India for its current development partnership and support during the Covid Pandemic and recalled the historic support of India for the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971. She also recalled the horrific assassination nearly 46 years ago of her father and founder of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujib on August 15, 1975, and the killing of several of her family members on that day. Sheikh Hasina was abroad at the time.   Earlier in the day, soon after his arrival in Dhaka, PM Modi visited the National Martyrs’ Memorial (Jatiyo Sriti Shoudho), the National monument of Bangladesh, at Savar, about 35 km north-west of Dhaka  to pay tributes to the valour and the sacrifice of those who gave their lives in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. PM Modi signed the visitor’s book in the monument and wrote, “I pray that the eternal flame at Savar remains a lasting reminder of the noble victory of truth and courage over deceit and oppression.” Bangladesh is celebrating 50 years of its existence this year and both countries are also celebrating 50 years of establishment of diplomatic relations with each other this year. The Indian armed forces’ victory over Pakistan in the war in December, 1971, had led to the liberation of the erstwhile East Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh as an Independent nation. The Pakistani Army’s crackdown began in March, 1971, and officially three million people were killed during the nine-month long war. PM Modi’s “historic visit is to celebrate Mujib Borsho- the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ; 50 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh; and 50 years of Bangladesh’s war of liberation”.   Paying homage to the martyrs of the freedom struggle, PM Modi said, “The photographs showing the atrocities and heinous crimes committed by the Pakistani Army did not let people sleep for days. We will not forget those who secured independence for Bangladesh by sacrificing oceans of blood. We will not forget (their sacrifice). ... Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerged as a ray of hope or the people both here and in India.” PM Modi added, “I must have been 20-22 years of age when I along with several of my colleagues offered a Satyagraha in support of Bangladesh’s struggle for Independence. I courted arrest while supporting the struggle for Bangladesh’s independence and went to jail.” PM Modi also recalled the efforts of the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the Bangladesh liberation war.   PM Modi further said, “I salute the brave soldiers of the Indian Army who stood with the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh in Muktijuddo (liberation war). Those who gave their blood in ‘Muktijuddo’, sacrificed themselves, and played a very big role in realising the dream of independent Bangladesh. This is one of the most memorable days of my life. I am grateful that Bangladesh has included me in this event. I am grateful that Bangladesh has invited India to take part in this function. It is a matter of our pride that we got the opportunity to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with the Gandhi Peace Prize.” India had conferred the prestigious award posthumously on Sheikh Mujib for the year 2020 just ahead of the visit.   PM Modi also praised the leadership of his counterpart Sheikh Hasina and mentioned the rapid strides in development made by Bangladesh under her leadership. He said Bangladesh had proved those wrong who had raised doubts and questioned the identity of Bangladesh. He also spoke about the current strong ties between the two nations, the supply of Indian-manufactured Covid vaccines to Bangladesh and landmark agreements between the two nations such as the Land Boundary Agreement. “We must remember that we've similar opportunities in fields of trade and commerce, but at the same time, we've similar threats like terrorism. The ideas and powers behind such types of inhumane acts are still active. We must remain vigilant and united to counter them,” PM Modi said, adding that both India and Bangladesh have the power of democracy and vision for the future, and it is necessary for the region the two countries progress together. “That is why Indian and Bangladeshi governments are making meaningful efforts in this direction,” he said. \r\n \r\nDuring the course of the day, he also met met Political leaders from Bangladesh’s ruling 14 Party Alliance and discussed “diverse issues of bilateral relations were held during the meeting to strengthen ties between the two nations”. But he also met met and interacted with opposition leaders from various political parties of Bangladesh. Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Dr A.K. Abdul Momen also called on PM Modi. Apart from this, PM Modi also met the Community leaders including Representatives of Minorities in Bangladesh, Bangladeshi Mukhtijoddhas (freedom fighters), Friends of India and Youth Icons.   Meanwhile, Bangladesh Police said four bodies of members of Hefazat-e-Islam, a hardline Islamist group, were brought to Chittagong Medical College Hospital after violence erupted at Hathazari, a rural town where the group's main leaders are based. “We got four bodies here. They are all hit with bullets. Three of them are madrasa students and another a tailor,” Alauddin Talukder, a police inspector at the hospital, told news agency AFP. He said at least four other demonstrators were critically injured but did not say who opened fire. Ruhul Amin, the government administrator of Hathazari town, said upto 1,500 supporters of Hefazat attacked a police station chanting anti-Modi slogans. “They attacked us all of a sudden,\" he said, without confirming whether any protesters were killed. Hathazari is home to one of Bangladesh's largest madrasas and is the headquarters of the Hefazat, which was formed in 2010 and is believed to be the country's largest hardline Islamist outfit.   According to other international news agency reports, by Friday afternoon, hundreds of protesters had also gathered outside Dhaka’s Baitul Mokarram Mosque after which violent clashes broke out after one faction of protesters began waving their shoes as a sign of disrespect to PM Modi, while another group tried to stop them. Protesters reportedly threw stones at the police, who were heavily present on the streets near the Mosque.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162915", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "19394", "source": "scrapy"},

I grew up envying the blond-haired, blue-eyed, skinny white girls on TV and the movies. It was hard not to hate my small eyes and flat features when all I ever saw in the media were portrayals of white beauty. Even my parents wanted me to get a nose job and shave down my cheekbones because that’s what they thought was beautiful ― not our faces, but  . I was ashamed of how we looked to everyone else: uncivilized, loud, smelly with garlic breath, and dumb with our broken English and awkward accents. I hated how enmeshed and closed off my family was and how it seemed like nothing outside of us was allowed in and we weren’t allowed out.  I used to hate being around other Asians ― in part because like most Korean Americans, I grew up in the church and thought that all Koreans were judgmental Christians, but also because I refused to accept that I was anything like  .  I hated how Asians traveled together in flocks and how abrasive their languages seemed compared to the calm consistency of English. I used to make fun of other Asians, believing I was nothing like them, and trying to convince myself that I was more American ― or more white ― than them.  Cathy Park Hong, author of “Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning,” writes, “Racial self-hatred is seeing yourself the way the whites see you, which turns you into your own worst enemy.” I became my own worst enemy from the moment I arrived at LAX at only 3 years old, beginning what now feels like a lifetime of assimilating to whiteness and desperately trying to be seen and accepted. For a large part of my youth and young adulthood, I spent my time in America fawning out of survival.   is one of the  , similar to flight, fight or freeze. Fawning is when you people-please to diffuse conflict in order to reestablish a sense of safety. I fawned by aiming to please white people and viewing myself the way they saw me. I fawned by laughing off racist jokes, microaggressions, fetishizations, and the repeated belittling of my cultural background and how I look.  I learned early on that this is what I would have to do to make it through alive. I laughed off countless “open your eyes” jokes and I begged my parents to buy me Lunchables so I wouldn’t have to bring smelly kimchi to school for lunch. A friend once told me I smelled weird, so I became accustomed to spraying myself from head to toe in perfume to mask the smell of Korea whenever I left my house.  I distanced myself from other Asians, thinking I had found the solution to all of my problems by aligning myself with white people, clinging to my proximity to whiteness. Instead of just   and my racial trauma, I simultaneously perpetuated and mocked Asian stereotypes and rejected the parts of myself that didn’t fit the white mold. As the saying goes,  .  I fawned into the  , designed to pit people of color against each other to uphold white supremacy. I fawned and tried to survive the only way I knew how, by blending in ― only that was never actually possible.  It wasn’t until I got older and I was able to explore my culture outside of my family of origin that I could appreciate these parts of myself that I desperately tried to keep hidden.  A few years after college, I felt called back to the motherland. My parents are both from large families, so I had tons of aunts, uncles, cousins and my grandmothers to welcome me with open arms. I was the black sheep in my family of origin and forever othered in America, but in Korea, I was home. For the first time, I saw myself as a Korean would.  Life in Seoul was like heaven to me because I was surrounded by faces that looked like mine. The language that sounded so harsh in America, in Korea felt like an old song I knew all the words to. I felt connected and a sense of belonging that I had never felt in the States. I didn’t have to hate myself anymore. In Korea, I learned about our painful history and just how much  . I learned about how long we’ve been carrying and passing down this trauma from generation to generation, until it reached me and my family ― the first to make it to the land of opportunity and freedom and have a go at the American dream.  But the thing about the American dream is that it’s actually only for white people. I learned that during the housing crash of 2008 when  , offering them a chance at this elusive dream only to take it all away. My parents lost everything and had to start their lives over again.  In 1992, during the LA riots, police were deployed in affluent, white neighborhoods while Black and Korean neighborhoods were left to burn. Many   right before their eyes. Now, in 2021, I see   after   of Asian Americans, mostly seniors and women, getting attacked on the street on a daily basis. More than ever, I hear it loudly and clearly: We are not seen as equals. No matter how hard we strive, we will never be white enough. When I came back to the States, I felt like I hit the reset button on life. I got to immigrate again with a fresh set of eyes and an actual connection to my culture that felt authentic, instead of what I knew from church and the 2-mile radius that is Korea-Town. This time, instead of complete assimilation, my goal became to   without compromising my sense of self.  The first thing I did was get myself a Korean American therapist who understood what it was like growing up   in America in order to process my racial trauma and identity issues. That’s when I realized that I wasn’t alone and that there were words to describe those of us who consist of more than one part and grew up exposed to the special trauma of acculturating without any guidance or support. Thanks to therapy, I understood that it was possible to exist as both Korean and American.  Growing up, I learned in school that America is a “cultural melting pot.” But what happens in a melting pot is that all these cultures mix together and erode the characteristics that make each unique in order to become a bland pot of the dominant culture. Now I see America as more of a fusion of flavors, where immigrants and people of color can preserve our customs while also adapting to life in America.  These days I’m proud of my bilingual skills. I love flexing my Korean in Korea-Town and being able to provide psychotherapy in my native tongue. I love making kimchi and every year I make jars of it that I give to non-Asian friends whose palates can now handle the heat. I’m no longer ashamed of myself and where I come from. Although I may not be able to change other people and situations, I can nurture myself and how I see myself and the world around me.  Now when people ask me what was once a very dreaded question ― “Where are you from?” which really means, “What are you?” ― I proudly respond that I’m Korean American because I want to normalize the fact that this country is made up of humans of all colors, shapes, sizes and ethnicities. I view myself from my own lens instead of filtering myself to appeal to white people because I want to show the world that this is what America truly looks like. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/602c2a532700003700681c7c.jpg?ops=100_100\" height=\"38px\" width=\"38px\" alt=\"headshot\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162915", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "60898", "source": "scrapy"},

The election authorities declared his vote as invalid.   In Vizianagaram district, polling was stopped in three stations in Anti Peta polling centre in Seethanagaram mandal as the voters found the name of YSR Congress dummy nominee Senapati Lakshmi in the ballot paper for MPTC polls though the official nominee was Senapati Nirmala. A repoll is likely to be held on Friday. Several adivasis in Visakhapatnam and other places faced a tough time to reach the polling stations for want of proper road connectivity. Hundreds of them crossed Matyasagedda in Arasu mandal to reach the polling stations. In Kurnool, two groups of voters entered into heated arguments at Devanakonda as some of them tried to resort to cross-voting. Police rushed to the spot and restored normalcy.   In Kadapa, at Utpativaripalle of Badvel mandal, YSR Congress supporters acted as agents at a polling station instead of TD activists, forcing the TD nominee Sirisha Reddy and the party agents to stage a protest. TD agents alleged that the signatures on the forms were not theirs. In Rajuvaripeta of Chapadu mandal, YSR Congress activists did not allow a TD agent to sit in the polling station. MPTC nominee Rajeshwari tried to disrupt the polling, forcing the police to take her into custody. In Guntur, TD activists from Gonepudi and Palapadu villages staged a protest in front of Narasaraopeta sub collector’s office, alleging that their polling agents were not being allowed to enter the polling stations by the YSR Congress leaders with the support from CI Krishnaiah.   The villagers from both the villages demanded a repoll and sought suspension of the CI. They alleged rigging of votes by YSR Congress leaders and submitted a representation to the officials. In Srikakulam, Krishna, Chittoor and Anantapur districts, polling was peaceful.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162916", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17595", "source": "scrapy"},

Now, when they want to return home, no bus service was available as KSRTC staff went on a strike since Wednesday.  Pilgrims have come to Srisailam from 13 districts in Karnataka, like Bijapur, Haveri, Bellari, Gulbarga, Raichur, Bidar, Hubbali, Bangalore, and Tumkur. Kurnool APSRTC regional manager  T Venkata Ramam said about 20 buses were sent on Thursday to Srisailam. There was some problem till afternoon and it was cleared thereafter, he said.   As the ZPTC and MPTC elections are also held on Thursday, we have dispatched 150 buses since Wednesday evening. Once they return on Thursday, they will be pressed into service, he said. “The passengers are brought up to Kurnool and from here they go to their respective destinations taking link services,” he said. A temple official said normally these pilgrims will wait till the Rathotsavam on April 13, Ugadi day. This year, maybe due to the corona scare, they were rushing to go back to their homes after the darshan. Buses from Achampet in Nagarkurnool district were also requisitioned to help the stranded pilgrims, said temple executive officer Rama Rao.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162916", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16305", "source": "scrapy"},

The 57-year-old Black woman from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, feared that her high blood pressure and diabetes might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. Then a member of Pringle’s church, a local NAACP leader who has led a vaccination campaign targeting Black residents, urged her to reconsider. He shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. “That’s what made me change my mind,” said Pringle, who finally agreed to an appointment to get her first   shot Thursday. “I had to pray about it. And I felt better after that.” Campaigns aimed at Black communities across the US are making headway in the effort to persuade people that the   vaccines are safe and effective. With millions of dollars in assistance from President Joe Biden’s administration, local groups have urged Black Americans to roll up their sleeves for shots and set aside what for some is a shared historical distrust of science and government. A poll by   for Public Affairs Research in late March found that about 24 percent of Black American adults said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. That’s down from 41 percent in January. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots in almost the same proportion as white Americans at 26 percent and Hispanic Americans at 22 percent. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken “almost a 180-degree turnaround” as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. He credited Black physicians, faith leaders and other community organisers for being trusted messengers during the pandemic, which has killed more than 5,50,000 Americans. “It’s the messenger and the message,” but the messenger “is probably the most important part of it, and people doing it in a way that wasn’t preachy,” Benjamin said. “They didn’t tell people, ‘You need to get vaccinated because it’s your duty.’ They basically said, ‘Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family.’” Some of the most effective outreach has relied on existing community relationships, such as local physicians talking about their own decisions to get vaccinated, to reassure the public, said Dr Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. Community members in the Baltimore area who knew Cooper from her research on food deserts and nutrition trusted her as a source of information on   , she said. Based on that relationship, “people felt comfortable hearing from me,” she said. Some state health departments have rolled out ads targeting communities of color. NAACP chapters in some cities have booked appointments for people to get shots. Pastors of Black churches have urged their parishioners to take the vaccines. In Brunswick, Georgia, the Rev John Perry and another Black pastor put their faces on a billboard promoting the vaccines, and postcards with a similar image were mailed to residents. Both efforts were produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. “I think we still have enough people on the fence that are going to budge and get their shots,” said Perry, who initially wanted to wait a year before getting his shots but changed his mind after reading up on how the vaccines were developed. He got his second dose Wednesday. Jason Pettibone, a Black barber in Perry’s coastal Georgia community, remains hesitant. His parents and sister have all been vaccinated with no ill effects. Yet Pettibone said the stories he hears from customers — including one who swore his father lost all feeling in the right side of his body after getting a shot — have made it hard to overcome his uncertainty. “I’m thinking in my head not only would it be good for me to get it, because I don’t want to get sick myself, but also to protect other people who come into the shop,” Pettibone said. “But it’s the unknown. Everybody’s really scared of the unknown.” In Savannah, Georgia, community activist Natavia Sanders said outreach efforts can backfire with some in the Black community who suspect the government is targeting them as test subjects rather than seeking to protect their health. Some of that skepticism can be traced to an infamous study in Tuskegee, Alabama, where the government let hundreds of Black men suffer untreated syphilis for 40 years for research purposes. Sanders declined to say whether she was getting vaccinated. She said she’s spoken with several people who had to be hospitalised with   but still have doubts about the vaccines. “That’s how skeptical people are,” Sanders said. “They’re like, ‘No, I’ll fight it myself. I fought it already.’” PM Browner got her vaccine Wednesday in Clarksdale, Mississippi. The 88-year-old Black woman said she doesn’t understand why she needs to get vaccinated if she’s not sick or around sick people. Still, she agreed to get her shot. She said she thinks vaccinations will eventually be required, and she wants to be able to continue to socialise at a local senior center. “If you ain’t got nothing, why do we need to take it?” Browner said. “But we’ll take it because later on, they’ll say, ‘You’ve got to take it.’ If you don’t, later on, I think we’ll have to.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" alt=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pfizer-vaccine-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162916", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "41723", "source": "scrapy"},

About 40% of white evangelical Protestants said they likely would not get vaccinated, according to  , compared to about 25% of all Americans, 28% of white mainline Protestants and 27% of Protestants who are not white.  “I’ve heard people I care about saying, you know, ‘If I’m faithful, God’s going to take care of me,’” Buttigieg said. “And I guess what I would hope that they might consider is that maybe a vaccine is part of God’s plan for how you’re going to take care of yourself.” Buttigieg acknowledged during the exchange on CNN that his opinion on the matter may not sway many white evangelicals, and he urged faith leaders to speak out in support of vaccines. “In the end, I have to admit that it’s unlikely that an official like me is going to be persuasive to somebody who maybe doesn’t feel like Washington has been speaking to them for a long time,” Buttigieg said.  “The idea of pastoral care is about supporting those who look to you for guidance,” he added. “So I hope anybody who is looking after a community of people, including a faith community, will consider ways to help guide them toward steps that can protect them and protect those around them.” There are about 41 million white evangelical adults nationwide. Public health experts have warned that the group’s widespread reluctance to get vaccinated could prolong the pandemic. “If we can’t get a significant number of white evangelicals to come around on this, the pandemic is going to last much longer than it needs to,” Jamie Aten, founder and executive director of the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton College, an evangelical institution in Illinois,  . Some white evangelicals have cited their religious beliefs in their refusal to get a vaccine, noting a remote connection between abortion and vaccine development. COVID-19 vaccines do not contain fetal tissue, but some were developed using cells derived from fetal tissue from elective abortions that took place decades ago, according to the Times. Other white evangelicals have pointed to their lack of trust in the government. “I just don’t really want to see the government or anybody force people to do something that those people feel like is not in their best interests,” a 49-year-old white evangelical man in Tennessee  . Public health experts largely consider COVID-19 vaccines to be   for ending the pandemic and returning to some sense of normalcy. Some high-profile conservative pastors, including Franklin Graham and Robert Jeffress, have publicly advocated for vaccination. But others have warned their followers against it.

The party’s bond with corporate America, however, is fraying. Fissures have burst open over the GOP’s embrace of conspiracy theories and rejection of mainstream climate science, as well as its dismissal of the 2020 election outcome. The most recent flashpoint was in Georgia, where a new Republican-backed law restricting voting rights   from Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, whose headquarters are in the state, and resulted in Major League Baseball pulling the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta. Republicans were furious. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned that their actions were   GOP strategists argued that they no longer needed corporate America’s money to win elections as they try to rebrand as a party of blue-collar workers. That extends an opportunity to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats to find an ally in an unlikely place when the party has unified control of the federal government for the first time in a decade. Biden is pushing an ambitious $2.3 trillion infrastructure package that includes corporate tax increases — which the White House is characterizing to CEOs as upfront investments that will ultimately make companies more profitable. “It’s important for making the country more competitive,” said Cedric Richmond, the White House’s director of public engagement. “We think the plan is so important to the country that we are advocating and singing its praises to all businesses.” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo estimates she has talked to more than 50 business leaders about the plan, including a round of Easter weekend phone calls. She is encouraging companies to focus on the entire package instead of the tax increases. “You can’t look at one piece of it and say that one number makes you walk away,” she said. “They say, ‘That’s fair. Let me think about it.’ That’s how they run their businesses.” Whether the corporate split with the GOP widens could help answer questions about the political direction of the country and the extent to which business can continue to influence Washington. “Nobody in the business community wants hostile communities, angry finger-pointing workforces and turbulent shareholder bases,” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management. “It makes your job so much harder to have every constituency group at war within themselves, which has become the hallmark of the GOP.” Corporate America’s marriage with Republicans has long been one of convenience, united by a belief in low taxes and the need to repeal regulations. But the relationship, already strained during Donald Trump’s presidency, has come under increasing pressure as companies take cultural stands. That Republicans and businesses report to increasingly distinct constituencies helps explain the tension. A solid majority of Republican voters are white (86%) and older than 50 (62%), according to APVoteCast, a national survey of the 2020 electorate. Yet figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that workers are more racially diverse and younger than the Republican base. James Bailey, a management professor at George Washington University, published an analysis last year that suggested people who identified as Democrats cared more about a company’s political activity than Republicans do. Of business people, he said the uproar over the Georgia voting law “is a great opportunity for them to get on board with the young socially active consumer and to do so without much cost.” Just as important, Democratic counties have become the primary engines for growth. The counties that backed Biden last year account for 71% of all U.S. economic activity, according to the Brookings Institution. Democrats say business are comfortable partnering with them to address longstanding issues such as infrastructure after a decade of congressional gridlock, even though companies dislike the possibility of footing the bill. “Responsible corporate leaders want economic growth and predictable, competent policy— that’s what Democrats are offering.” said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who is running the House Democrats’ campaign arm for the 2022 midterm elections. Many Republicans are exasperated by business’s efforts to woo consumers through liberal social politics. “They are never going to satisfy the demands of the left,” said Steven Law, a former attorney for the Chamber who now runs Senate Leadership Fund, a big-spending outside group aligned with McConnell. Meantime “they risk alienating their natural allies in the Republican Party.” Still, Republicans have been a major driver of the rift, looking to capitalize on the culture clash to turn out the party base in the next election. Early indicators suggest business could face blowback. Georgia’s Republican-controlled House voted to strip Delta of a tax break worth tens of millions of dollars annually for its criticism of the new restrictive law, which voting rights groups have excoriated as an attack on democracy. The intended punishment was rendered moot after the GOP Senate failed to take it up before the legislative session adjourned. Campaign finance disclosures suggest corporate America’s money doesn’t buy as much influence as it once did. Roughly a decade ago, donations from company-sponsored political action committees accounted for an important share of the fundraising pie. But it’s stagnated as a source of campaign cash, as court rulings enabled wealthy GOP activists to pour money into the political system. Just 10 GOP megadonors account for half of the giving to major super political action committees controlled by Republican congressional leaders since 2012, collectively pouring $541 million into the committees, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of donors who gave over $1,000. The megadonors also contributed twice as much as conventional PACs and other groups that represent a broad swath of corporate interests. Political spending by the Chamber has also dropped precipitously. After spending $29 million in 2016, mostly supporting Republicans and attacking Democrats, the group’s contributions dropped to $10.9 million in 2018, according to data from nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. In 2020,  , which Republicans saw as a betrayal. That’s diminished the group’s once unassailable standing with GOP congressional leaders. “There is absolutely no love lost for corporations, especially when they consistently weigh in on things they don’t understand,” said Josh Holmes, a political adviser to McConnell. “There’s no sympathy.” Common ground still exists between Republicans and business on the value of tax cuts. The Chamber and the Business Roundtable oppose raising the corporate rate to 28% from the 21% level set in 2017, as well as an enhanced global minimum tax. Yet both groups want government spending on infrastructure. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s chief policy officer, said the broader business community isn’t fully aligned with either party. But the hyperpartisan nature of today’s politics is creating pressure to choose one side. “It really causes people to want to sort everything into a red camp or a blue camp,” he said. “Businesses aren’t partisan. They aren’t Republicans or Democrats. They have to operate and function in divided governments, operate in states that are solid blue and solid red.” Republicans caution, however, that business faces considerable risk weighing in on hot-button disputes. “They ought to tread carefully because they risk getting into the middle of a culture war that will earn them no friends and a lot of enemies,” said Law, the McConnell ally.", "image_url": "<img class=\"image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/607316fa2100001c007eed39.jpg?cache=v9qmv89nid&amp;ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" alt=\"In this April 5, 2021, file photo Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., listens to a reporter's question during a ne\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162917", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "60578", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.firstpost.com", "section": "health", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.firstpost.com/health/india-records-152879-new-covid-19-infections-active-cases-cross-11-lakh-for-first-time-9516531.html", "title": "\n                    India records 1,52,879 new COVID-19 infections; active cases cross 11 lakh for first time\n                ", "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "\n                    The toll increased to 1,69,275 with 839 daily new fatalities, the highest since 18 October, 2020, official data showed\n                ", "text": " Hitting another record daily high of 1,52,879 new   infections, India's   tally of cases climbed to 1,33,58,805, while the active cases breached the 11-lakh mark for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Sunday.

As dozens of new blazes scorched the countryside and the country's largest city was cloaked in hazardous smoke, conservative leader Scott Morrison defended his climate record, saying Australia was \"doing our bit\". His comments came after weeks spent refusing to speak about the link between climate change and deadly fires described by the emergency services as unprecedented in number and scale for the early bushfire season. As more people in the southeast of the country were told to evacuate their homes and schoolchildren in Sydney were again forced to play indoors, Morrison dismissed mounting calls for action. \"The suggestion that any way shape or form that Australia, accounting for 1.3 per cent of the world's emissions... are impacting directly on specific fire events, whether it is here or anywhere else in the world, that doesn't bear up to credible scientific evidence,\" he told ABC radio. Scientists, former fire chiefs and residents touched by bushfires have all drawn the link between this season's more intense fires and climate change. Drought, unseasonably hot, dry and windy conditions have fuelled the unprecedented blazes. Scientists believe many of those factors are made worse by rising global temperatures. On Thursday bushfires burned across every region of Australia with residents in Victoria warned to leave high-risk areas and officials in New South Wales reporting more than 600 homes have been destroyed in recent weeks. Morrison is facing calls to cut greenhouse gas emissions and rapidly transition to renewable energy -- a sensitive debate in light of Australia's lucrative mining industry. Australia has committed to globally agreed climate targets to help limit warming, but its emissions continue to rise and targets are only being met with the use of some creative carbon accounting, using credits gained in past decades. While Australia's burning of fossil fuels accounts for only a fraction of global emissions, coal dug up Down Under and burned around the world makes the country a major emissions exporter. '  east coast have claimed six lives since mid-October. Now the fire danger has moved into states further south, with more than 60 fires breaking out in Victoria on Thursday, including five at \"emergency\" level, after a so-called \"Code Red\" fire danger was declared for the first time in a decade. Victoria Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said firefighters were batting \"some of the worst conditions that you'd expect to see, often in February or March, and we're seeing them in November\". \"It is incredibly dry, it will continue to get drier as the months go on over this summer, so the conditions we see today are likely conditions that we'll confront over this summer,\" she said. The Bureau of Meteorology said \"large areas\" of central and eastern Victoria broke maximum temperature records for November, including in Melbourne where the mercury reached 40.9 Celsius, while a dramatic dust storm swept through the town of Mildura, turning the sky a vivid orange. Country Fire Authority chief Steve Warrington earlier told people living in high-risk rural areas to leave for the safety of cities. \"We are saying, 'do not be there, do not be there when a fire occurs, because you will not survive if you are there',\" he said. The fire danger was also elevated to \"extreme\" in the island state of Tasmania off mainland Australia's southeastern coast, one of several areas where a total fire ban was declared. For the second time in three days,  , Australia's biggest city and an area that is home to more than five million people, sending air quality plummeting to hazardous levels. In South Australia, the state capital Adelaide was also shrouded in bushfire smoke and residents were being told to stay indoors for health reasons. More than 110 fires are still burning in worst-hit New South Wales and neighbouring Queensland, while in South Australia more than 40 fires broke out during catastrophic fire conditions Wednesday.  The country is bracing for challenging fire conditions to continue throughout the Southern Hemisphere summer.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/11/12/116522-untitled-design-6.jpg?itok=6yxaLOC4\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162914", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22638", "source": "scrapy"},

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162918", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16252", "source": "scrapy"},

The study commissioned by UNICEF blamed \"drastic cuts in the availability and use of essential public health services\" because of the pandemic across India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, home to 1.8 billion people.   \"The fall-off of these critical services has had a devastating impact on the health and nutrition of the poorest families,\" said UNICEF regional director George Laryea-Adjei. \"It is absolutely vital that these services are fully restored for children and mothers who are in desperate need of them, and that everything possible is done to ensure that people feel safe to use them,\" Laryea-Adjei said. The estimates were based on actual observed changes and modelling exercises using data from before the pandemic in South Asia, where in 2019 alone 1.4 million children under five died, 63 percent of them newborn babies. Countries in the region, like elsewhere, imposed stringent lockdown measures to halt the spread of coronavirus. Many restrictions have since been eased although many schools remain shut.   The report said that even where health services were not shut down, the number of people visiting them declined. In Bangladesh and Nepal, for example, the number of young children being treated for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) fell by over 80 per cent, while child vaccinations fell sharply in India and Pakistan. With some 420 million children in South Asia out of school due to the pandemic, the report also warned that nine million children were likely never to return to school, the report added. This in turn is expected to lead to an increase in child marriages, resulting in an additional 400,000 adolescent pregnancies, as well as an increase in the number of maternal and neonatal deaths, and in rates of child stunting.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162915", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16405", "source": "scrapy"},

The scientists from Denmark's Statens Serum Institute analysed data collected as part of the country's national COVID-19 testing strategy, through which more than two-thirds of the population (four million people) were tested in 2020.   According to the scientists, while prior infection gave those under the age of 65 years around 80 per cent protection against reinfection, for those 65 and older it conferred only 47 per cent protection, indicating they are more likely to catch COVID-19 again. In the study, the researchers calculated the ratios of positive and negative test results taking account of differences in age, sex, and time since infection, using which they produced estimates of protection against reinfection. Among people who had COVID-19 during the first wave between March and May 2020, they said only 0.65 per cent tested positive again during the second wave from September to December 2020.   The rate of infection was five times higher, at 3.3 per cent, among those who returned a positive test during the second wave having previously tested negative. Among those under the age of 65 who had COVID-19 during the first wave, 0.60 per cent tested positive again during the second wave, the study noted. However, the rate of infection during the second wave among people in this age group who had previously tested negative was 3.60 per cent. The researchers noted that older people are at greater risk of reinfection, with 0.88 per cent of those aged 65 or older who were infected during the first wave testing positive again in the second wave.   During this second wave, 2 per cent tested positive among those 65 or older who had previously not had COVID-19, the study noted. Due to the time frame of the study, the scientists said it was not possible to estimate protection against reinfection with COVID-19 variants, some of which are known to be more transmissible. They said further studies are needed to assess how protection against repeat infection might vary with different COVID-19 strains. Based on the analysis, the researchers suggested that people who have had the virus should still be vaccinated, as natural protection -- particularly among the elderly -- cannot be relied upon.   They believe the findings highlight the importance of measures to protect elderly people during the pandemic, such as enhanced social distancing and prioritisation for vaccines, even for those who have recovered from COVID-19. \"Our study confirms what a number of others appeared to suggest -- reinfection with COVID-19 is rare in younger, healthy people, but the elderly are at greater risk of catching it again,\" said study co-author Steen Ethelberg, from the Statens Serum Institut. \"Since older people are also more likely to experience severe disease symptoms, and sadly die, our findings make clear how important it is to implement policies to protect the elderly during the pandemic,\" Ethelberg said.   Citing the limitations of the study, the researchers said clinical information was recorded only if patients were admitted to hospital, adding that it was not possible to assess whether the severity of COVID-19 symptoms affects patients' protection against reinfection. While PCR tests are believed to be highly accurate, the authors expect only around two false positives for every 10,000 tests in uninfected people and around three false negatives for every 100 tests in people with the infection. The scientists said there was no evidence yet that protection against repeat infection with COVID-19 waned within six months. Since COVID-19 was only identified in December 2019, they said the period of protective immunity conferred by infection has still to be determined.   \"In our study, we did not identify anything to indicate that protection against reinfection declines within six months of having COVID-19,\" said study co-author Daniela Michlmayr. \"The closely related coronaviruses SARS and MERS have both been shown to confer immune protection against reinfection lasting up to three years, but ongoing analysis of COVID-19 is needed to understand its long-term effects on patients' chances of becoming infected again,\" Michlmayr added.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162916", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17192", "source": "scrapy"},

Le Dinh Chuc and Le Dinh Cong, who were sentenced to death on Sept. 14, 2020, had been urged by prison officials to appeal directly to Vietnam’s president for amnesty, which would have seen their sentences reduced to life terms, Cong’s daughter-in-law Nguyen Thi Duyen told RFA at the weekend. “Both my father and my uncle [Le Dinh Chuc] said that prison officers had advised them many times to submit a request for amnesty, but that they had refused to do so,” Duyen said, following a March 26 visit with family members to the Hanoi Police Detention Center No. 2. Duyen said that Chuc told family members an application for amnesty would mean an admission of guilt in the case. “Uncle Chuc said that our family members should not cry or grieve, as he and my father-in-law would declare their innocence until the end,” she said. On March 9, an appellate court in Hanoi upheld the sentences conferred on Sept. 14, 2020 by a lower court on six land-rights activists involved in the deadly clash at Dong Tam commune, including the death sentences imposed on Cong and Chuc. In the Jan. 9, 2020 early-morning raid on the village by 3,000 security officers intervening in a long-running dispute over a military construction site about 25 miles south of the capital, Hanoi, village elder Le Dinh Kinh, 84, and three police officers were killed. Le’s sons Le Dinh Chuc and Le Dinh Cong were both sentenced to death for murder in connection with the deaths of the three officers who were killed in the clash when they were attacked with petrol bombs and fell into a concrete shaft while running between two houses. They were among a group of 29 villagers tried for their role in the incident. Other punishments handed out by the court included a life sentence and other sentences ranging from six years to 15 months of probation. Both Cong and Chuc appeared healthy during the March 26 family visit, but Cong became emotional when he saw his grandchildren, Duyen told RFA, adding that her father-in-law continued to assert his innocence of the charges against him. “He said that if he had actually murdered anyone, he would have been obsessed by feelings of guilt while he was held in solitary confinement in the jail, but that he hadn’t been troubled by feelings like these at all,” Duyen said. “Neither our family members nor any other Dong Tam people killed anyone either,” she said. Le Dinh Kinh’s widow Du Thi Thanh was barred at first by guards from seeing her two sons during the March 26 visit because she had not brought her identification card, but was finally allowed to visit briefly with Chuc once his meeting with other family members ended, Duyen said.

The aircraft was set to leave much earlier but was delayed owing to China's screening process whereby they wanted to check everybody's temperature. \r\n \r\nThe flight will land at an air force base in Western Australia, from where the passengers will be flown to Christmas Island, which is almost 1,500 kilometres away from the mainland.  \r\n \r\nAccording to Payne, military flights will be used to transport the evacuees.  The Chinese city of Wuhan has been quarantined and is under complete lockdown after the emergence of coronavirus. The first death from the virus outside of Chinese territory was reported in the Philippines yesterday. Canberra could consider further evacuations if needed, suggested Payne, considering that there were 600 Australians registered in the Hubei region as of last week. After the United States, Australia on Saturday banned the entry of all foreign nationals coming from mainland China. The travel warning for China was raised to the highest level.

The health minister of the country claimed that it's an imperative step in curating a vaccine. As of now, the virus has infected over 168,000 people globally with more than 6,000 deaths reported. However, most of the infected patients display mild symptoms, out of which only 20 per cent reach the critical stage.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the mortality rate of the virus is 3.4 per cent Researchers at Australia's Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity examined blood results from an anonymous woman in her 40s and found that the immune systems of people respond to the virus as it would to the flu. \r\n \r\nThis can shed light on how many patients recover from the infection while others end up developing serious respiratory issues. \r\n \r\n“People can use our methods to understand the immune responses in larger COVID-19 cohorts, and also understand what’s lacking in those who have fatal outcomes,” said Katherine Kedzierska, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Melbourne, which took part in the research.  Based on their findings and the response of the immune system to the virus, the researchers were able to correctly predict the timeframe by which the patient would recover. The patient in question is an Australian citizen who was evacuated out of Wuhan, where the virus began in China. \r\n \r\nAustralian Health Minister Greg Hunt called this feat ''world-leading'', marking a major development in the research process to understanding and containing the disease.   \r\n \r\n“It’s about fast-tracking a vaccine by identifying which candidates are most likely to be successful,” Hunt said. “It’s also about fast-tracking potential therapies and treatments for patients who already have coronavirus”, he added. Globally, all drugmakers are attempting to conjure a vaccine against the contagion which is gaining traction in the world quickly. However, there are multiple roadblocks in finding a viable vaccine, for the cost could be as high as $800 million.

Most infections have so far been detected in urban areas.  The move to protect indigenous populations could pave the way for the vast Northern Territory and other areas to be cut off from the rest of the country.  Health experts have warned that high rates of chronic illness, overcrowded housing and poor access to medical facilities in remote indigenous communities could exacerbate the impact of the virus. \"Just an extraordinarily high number of people have diabetes and have had a heart attack or stroke, things like that,\" Jason Agostino, a medical adviser for the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, told AFP. \"We know that particularly people that have had a heart attack and stroke, from the data from China suggests that, they're at the highest risk.\" Earlier this week a South Australian indigenous council announced they were restricting access for outside visitors in a bid to protect the community from the virus. The council also encouraged locals to remain home, a move mirrored in indigenous centres around the country. Research suggests the outbreak of Swine Flu in 2009 impacted indigenous Australians much harder than the rest of the country, with three times more Aboriginal people hospitalised with the disease. Life expectancy for Aboriginal Australians is about eight years lower than the national average.  Indigenous children are twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday, according to official statistics. The government's announcement stopped short of calling in army medical teams, a move urged by some Aboriginal health groups. The extreme isolation of some communities made it particularly hard to combat the disease, Agostino said. \"We're talking hundreds of kilometres from the nearest hospital and days until we even get the results of the COVID tests, with some people we're talking about more than a week to get a result,\" he said. Many indigenous Australians also live in overcrowded housing where self-isolation was not possible, he added. ", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/16/133056-untitled-design5.jpg?itok=-Y81Pmdr\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162919", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21682", "source": "scrapy"},

Australia, like most countries in the world, has shut down non-essential services to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. To further tackle the domestic violence issue, the government has sanctioned a US $100 million package. This money has been allocated to support services that deal with cases of domestic abuse. A charity in Australia with the name “Women’s Safety” reported over a 40 per cent surge in clients calling for help. The charity functions in the state of New South Wales, and claimed that most cases were related to lockdown induced by the pandemic, news agency AFP reported. In the state of Victoria, “Wayss”, another support service for women, claims that the number of domestic cases had doubled over the last week. They believe this is a peculiar state of affairs. Wayss’ chief executive Liz Thomas, in conversation with ABC said that this surge may be attributed to lack of release elsewhere, which was otherwise accessible to the public. \"We've also seen half a dozen examples in the past week where perpetrators have actually used Covid-19 as a form of abuse - telling their partner that they have the virus, therefore they can't leave the house\", she told ABC. Other threats include calling strangers into the house to incite fear among their partners by claiming that the person carries the virus. The boost package constitutes a bigger health relief package amounting to 1.1 billion Australian dollars. \"We need to put more resources into supporting people who will be vulnerable and may be vulnerable,\" Prime Minister told reporters.

The team is preparing for the forthcoming IPL to be held from 09 April. As part of the protocol, the entire SRH team has been in quarantine and living in a bio bubble since March 28. Incidentally, the players have not been allowed to go out of their hotel rooms to even start practice until they tested negative for the third time too.   In an interaction with Deccan Chronicle, SRH’s mentor V.V.S. Laxman talks about how his players are upbeat and looking forward to an exciting tournament. “The boys just had a go at the nets and it’s been pretty good,” Laxman shares. “Most of the Indian players played domestic cricket (Vijay Hazare tourney) while the foreign players played for their respective national sides. So we are trying to capitalise this entire week for our practice sessions.” Even so, IPL for Laxman has always been such a tournament in which the players have to gel well as a team. “And the good thing is that we [SRH] always played well as a cohesive unit and that’s been our strength,” he states, adding, “In fact, we are one of the most consistent teams in the last few years.”   Having retained their core group for the 2021 season, SRH looks strong in batting with the likes of David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy, Kane Williamson, Manish Padey, etc. So too, Laxman is quite certain that SRH has the potential to beat any side. But added to the confidence in his team members’ performance is his assurance that the team has taken back lessons from IPL’s last season in Dubai. “I think overall it’s important to get a good quick breakthroughs. I believe winning crucial moments is significant,” he states. The franchise has, nevertheless, been criticised for depending heavily on the top order. But Laxman is undeterred by the talk and says that the team has players who can strengthen middle order too.   “This season players such as Kedar Jadhav will boost our depth in the batting; his experience will not only add diversity but also strike a balance in the line-up,” assures the former India cricketer. The batting great further revels in the fact that the team has got players who can perform in any conditions. None of his confidence in his team, however, means he is blinded to their weaknesses, the mark of a true mentor. “An area we need to work on is to maintain the positive frame of mind and attitude of the players when they are part of the bubble for a long time.”   Laxman is also convinced that as the players have been part of the bio bubble in the earlier series too, getting into the groove will not be so difficult. \r\nEven as the IPL time is being held in India this year, the Hyderabadi batsman is aware that the strategy for tourneys of such magnitude keeps changing. “Strategies change according to the situations, conditions, pitch, opposition, etc. But luckily we’ve got players who can execute strategies even in the toughest conditions. So winning the tournament is all about seizing the momentum early and sustaining it. And for this, players have to be consistent and tough — physically and mentally tough.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162918", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16913", "source": "scrapy"},

Andrew Cuomo (D) helped drive the change as well.", "text": "When New York state Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a Bronx Democrat, first got to Albany in 2011, being an outspoken progressive was often a lonely task. Rivera still remembers the first time he was “Percoco’d” ― Rivera’s joking moniker for the nasty phone calls he would get from New York Gov.  ’s top aide, and enforcer, Joe Percoco. Rivera had joined a demonstration on the lawn of the governor’s mansion calling for the state to raise taxes on millionaires in order to fully fund public education. Percoco berated Rivera for “disrespecting” the governor’s house and subsequently disinvited the state senator from a reception honoring former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson (D). Colleagues warned Rivera to keep his head down, but he ignored them ― and now he feels vindicated. Percoco went to prison in   for soliciting bribes. And this week the redistributive economic policies that Rivera dreamed about in 2011 became a reality. On Wednesday, New York’s overwhelmingly Democratic state legislature   for the 2022 fiscal year that will raise $4.5 billion in taxes on millionaires and corporations to fund economic relief for undocumented immigrants, schools and housing assistance. Cuomo, who beat back other tax hikes for a decade, has promised to sign it. The progressive slant of the tax-and-spending legislation marks a tidal change in Empire State politics that would have been hard to imagine six months ago, let alone at the start of Cuomo’s tenure in 2011. “The proof is in the pudding,” Rivera declared. “We were able to achieve so many things that the governor has resisted for so long.” It’s possible because of a combination of massive progressive gains in the state legislature, aggressive pressure tactics and the rapid decline in Cuomo’s influence, all of which converged to turn New York into a national leader in left-leaning economic policy. “The Biden administration should be looking to New York to say, ‘This is what Democrats can and should be doing to deliver for working-class people,’” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for the tenants’ rights group Housing Justice for All. “It’s exciting!” Although New York was facing a $15 billion budget deficit due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, federal aid and new tax increases allowed the state government to adopt a $212 billion budget. It’s a significantly larger sum than both the   that Cuomo signed a year ago at the height of the pandemic or the   a year before that when COVID-19 was still inconceivable. The new budget has its share of standard Democratic priorities, but the suite of laws that collectively authorize spending priorities and regulations for the coming fiscal year also introduces a host of groundbreaking initiatives. In a key win for Weaver’s group, the state has extended its eviction moratorium for another year and created a $2.4 billion fund for low- and middle-income tenants to pay off as much as 12 months’ rent payments for which they are in arrears because of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For the first time in a decade, the state is due to fully fund public schools in accordance with a   requiring New York to spend billions of dollars more to fulfill its constitutional obligation to provide residents an adequate education. The new state budget increases the court-mandated funding, known as Foundation Aid, by $1.4 billion, enabling New York to make up for years of underpayment. In addition, New York has created a $2.1 billion “excluded workers” fund that makes undocumented immigrant workers who lost work eligible for up to $15,600 in unemployment benefits. Because of these workers’ immigration status, they have been ineligible for federal benefits. The most radical element of New York’s budget, though, is the way it funds these priorities by asking the state’s wealthiest residents to pay more in taxes. New York’s millionaires are now due to pay the highest state income taxes in the country.  New Yorkers earning $1 million to $5 million a year would see their top tax rate go from 8.82% to 9.65%. The budget creates income tax brackets subjecting earnings from $5 million to $25 million to a 10.3% tax rate and income above $25 million to a 10.9% tax. The state’s corporate income tax rate is also going from 6.5% to 7.25% for companies with incomes of $5 million a year or more. Providing New Yorkers with economic opportunity “means balancing tax structures, balancing wealth inequality,” said state Assemblywoman Amanda Septimo (D), a South Bronx progressive. “This is a budget that takes a serious attempt at doing that.” New York’s corporate community has been less enthusiastic. Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a big business lobby, told   that raising taxes in spite of the federal aid the state is due to receive is “pure venom.” Wylde’s criticism reflects the frustration of the larger business community with its diminished clout in Albany. The most obvious short-term reason for corporate New York’s losing hand is the declining influence of Cuomo. The business-friendly governor has spent the past month fending off   over allegations of sexual misconduct and for covering up the number of COVID-19 deaths in the  .  Since he has been focused on shoring up his public image, Cuomo was less directly involved in negotiating the budget than he ordinarily would be.  What’s more, Democrats in the state legislature have the votes to override a veto by Cuomo.  Given Cuomo’s desire to retain support in the state Assembly, which has the authority to  , it is unlikely that he would risk alienating Democrats with a contentious budget fight, according to Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and centrist political consultant. “Cuomo didn’t have the power to stop them,” Tusk said. Cuomo’s new weakness, however, is only one of several reasons for the progressive nature of the budget. A decade of progressive organizing had shifted the ground underneath Cuomo long before scandals reduced his leverage. For his first eight years in office, Cuomo maintained a business-friendly consensus in Albany by doing what he could to keep Republicans in charge of the state Senate. For example, he quietly blessed the formation of the  , a group of rogue Senate Democrats that effectively guaranteed GOP control of the chamber.  But the 2016 election of Donald Trump as president radicalized New York Democrats. These Democrats, eager to fight back against Republicans, were   to learn about the IDC’s existence, providing an organic constituency for a Democratic takeover of the state Senate led by seasoned outfits like the New York Working Families Party.  “There is a bigger organized left than has existed recently and is working together with organized labor and some nonprofits to bring more people into politics,” said Weaver, a member of the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, which also experienced explosive growth during this period. Although Cuomo   to dissolve the IDC in April 2018, progressives refused to give up their campaign against the ex-IDC members. They succeeded in  , signaling that New York Democrats were prepared to punish lawmakers who betrayed the party’s core principles. For its part, DSA helped elect   to the state Senate in a separate 2018 primary challenge. The Brooklyn Democrat has since been joined by five more DSA-aligned Democrats. Facing a Democratic-controlled legislature for the first time in 2019, Cuomo proved more pliant. He reluctantly   a bill strengthening rent regulations for the state’s population of struggling tenants, defying the real estate industry with which he was usually aligned.  Weaver sees the bill’s passage as a key turning point. “Ever since 2019 … organized people are able to outmaneuver the governor and win truly transformative, redistributive legislation in Albany,” she said. A slew of   paved the way for another watershed election for Democrats in 2020. In November, New York Democrats won a veto-proof supermajority in the state Senate, complementing its existing supermajority in the Assembly. The progressive changes in this year’s budget would likely have been possible without the larger Democratic majorities in the legislature. “There were a lot more receptive ears on the inside than there normally would be,” state Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, a Queens Democrat, said.  “You have to have a united message and keep hammering it over and over again,” Bailin said.  Every Friday morning, IONY leaders met with a group of core progressive lawmakers, or “champions,” to talk strategy.  To help lawmakers win over wayward colleagues, IONY combined traditional activism events with resources aimed at winning the intellectual war. The coalition released a   on March 19 showing how the wealth of New York’s super-rich exploded during the pandemic and assembled   from wealthy New Yorkers asking Cuomo to raise their own taxes. When it came to rebutting claims that tax hikes would prompt a mass exodus from New York, the research of Cornell University sociologist  , author of   proved critical. Based on an analysis of a dozen years of tax returns for 3.7 million Americans with annual incomes of $1 million or more, Young   of the total moved to lower-tax states. Tusk conceded that the tax hikes were not likely to trigger a flood of wealthy departures from New York but warned that “since so few people pay such a high percentage of the taxes, even a modest flight can cause a lot of problems.” “I hope the new spending does more than just make the left feel good because otherwise it would have accomplished more either by remaining in the economy or going to people directly through [universal basic income],” Tusk added. In the end, IONY and its allies employed a mixture of policy horse-trading and grassroots pressure to cajole just enough moderate Democratic holdouts. Volunteers from New York City DSA canvassed the neighborhoods of fence-sitting lawmakers, placing custom-made door hangers at voters’ doors with the office phone number of the lawmaker and a model script to use during a call. “Call your legislator and tell them no cuts to our subways, schools and hospitals ― Senator Brian Kavanagh, tax the rich,” a door hanger targeting a Lower Manhattan Democrat stated. (He ended up voting yes.) In the course of negotiations, plenty of progressive revenue raisers got left on the cutting-room floor, including a tax on large inheritances, a financial transactions tax and a long-term capital gains surtax. The left wants that additional revenue so New York can, among other things, enact universal pre-kindergarten education, adopt single-payer health care and provide housing vouchers to the state’s homeless population. “We’re not done yet,” Brooklyn state Sen. Jabari Brisport, a DSA-aligned Democrat, said at a  . “This is bittersweet to me because the amount that we’re raising ― 3, 4, 5 billion, what is that to the billionaires?” Rivera has found himself commending his younger progressive colleagues for their passion and sharing in their frustration that the bill wasn’t even more ambitious. He then reminds them of just how far the legislature has come in such a short period. “$4.5 billion in new revenue is nothing to sneeze at,” Rivera said. ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6071caf11e0000ce150fedff.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" alt=\"Members of the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America blanketed key lawmakers' districts with door han\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162920", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "65822", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asianage.com:443", "section": "life", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asianage.com:443/life/food/200321/ranjona-banerji-what-cooking-teaches-how-tastes-are-learned.html", "title": null, "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "I really learnt how to cook by experimentation. And by eating. To replicate tastes and memories", "text": "The cooking revolution was perhaps one of the upsides of the pandemic. Entitled people who employed cooks suddenly found themselves staring at unprepossessing bunches of bottle gourd and cabbages and tried to imagine how to make them appetising. I shared with great enthusiasm some 10 “one-pot” recipes with family and friends until I ran out of steam and they ran out of ingredients. Early in the lockdown of 2020, a friend started a recipe-sharing online group. It was brilliant. A bunch of similarly middle class but otherwise disparate people tried to make each other’s lives easier with tips and recipes and answers.   It was a very happy experience for a short while. And then as the group grew, it became a cesspit of gender, ethnic, caste, caste biases. (There would have been race if we had enough varied races in the group.) Anger and accusations, offence and defence, and suddenly we weren’t talking about how to best temper a daal but oh, in my high caste family we never eat X, Y and so on. That something so beautiful in its conception and its early days could descend so quickly into fractious lines of othering and hatred is testament to the human ability to destroy anything worthwhile with our inherent stupidity. That said, I learnt a lot in my first few weeks and top of the list is an onion chutney for idlis and dosas. With due apologies to our esteemed Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and anyone else who doesn’t eat onions or care how much they cost. It is delicious so the loss is not mine.   My journey as a cook started somewhat before the online world governed our lives. Like many of my sort, I tried a little baking. At 10 I proudly made a hard as rock cake that wasn’t supposed to be a rock cake and watched in awe as a visiting family friend munched through it saying “delicious” after every long torturous chewing expedition. I haven’t forgotten his kindness and he still claims it was delicious! This story is my Mother’s. When I was about 16, my grandparents were horrified that she hadn’t taught me how to make proper “Indian” food. Baking did not count in the marriage mart scheme of things. (This turned out to be correct. During one of my parents’ many short-lived disasters into the murky world of arranged marriages for me, one grandmother said all her grandson wanted from a bride was the ability to make fried brinjal wheels. The conversation did not go any further nor did the fancy cake I had baked.) My Mother told me that her honour was at stake and it was up to me to uphold it.   I cooked whatever I did. At the end of the meal, my Mother informed the grandparents of the reality. They blustered “but, but you never taught her”. My Mother, a teacher, had the last word: “I taught her how to gather knowledge.” No answer to that. But I really learnt how to cook by experimentation. And by eating. To replicate tastes and memories. To try new things and ideas that were floating about in my head. And all that means stepping out of your comfort zone. For instance, when I was in my late teens all I wanted to eat at a Chinese restaurant was chilli chicken. I know, right. Even if “Indian Chinese” in the early 1980s was not as resplendent in choice as it is now, that was a pretty dumb choice to have set in stone.   I also experimented with vegetarianism in my early 20s. Until I got tempted by taste. O dear. Crabs at Kamling and chicken at Baghdadi. I got done in by Bombay, you might argue and that set me on my culinary journey. Underlying that of course is childhood. Bengalis have a terrible phrase inflicted on children and on us by our grandmother: “khete shekho”. Learn to eat. Attached to this phrase were some pretty gruesome vegetables like chichinge or snake gourd and borboti or yardlong or asparagus beans. There is no taste connection between this bean and an asparagus, it has to be made clear. To this day, I cannot and will not eat these. Add to this cluster beans aka gawar ka phalli, which is not a Bengali staple but which I won’t eat anyway.   Conversely my Mother hated arbi or taro root or Colocasia corms. So we never ate that at home. I love it. My paternal grandfather hated pumpkin of all kinds so that was banned, but now we find we love it. What sense does it make? None at all. The Chinese ability to get over food taboos may be unpalatable for some, but shows a remarkable ability to adapt. There is no moral high ground in proclaiming that you are too superior to eat onions. It only means that your mind is consumed by taught rigidities. Food taboos however are a topic of great sensitivity and resultant anger, so let’s not go there! To each her own. But I made two fabulous new finds recently: buds of the Bombax ceiba and Bauhinia flowers. In both cases, the vegetable vendors were pleasantly amazed that I wanted to buy these local delicacies, having stereotyped me as a ‘broccoli and salad patta” buyer. One asked me to look up the Internet for recipes, the other explained how to cook the kachnar. The look of his joy when I came back to buy more was delightful.   I realise I have left the door open for the great controversy of “veg biryani”. Maybe for another time?", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162918", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17741", "source": "scrapy"},

The company now says its vaccine is 76 rather than 79 percent effective at preventing any kind of symptomatic Covid.   It remains 100 percent effective against severe Covid, it added. The move came after an independent panel of experts appointed to supervise the trial expressed concern that AstraZeneca had failed to include updated data in its initially released figure. The US National Institutes of Health then issued a highly unusual statement asking AstraZeneca to work with the panel and issue a new press release. \"We look forward to filing our regulatory submission for Emergency Use Authorization in the US and preparing for the rollout of millions of doses across America,\" said Mene Pangalos executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development.   The new figure is based on 190 people who fell sick among 32,449 trial participants across the United States, Peru and Chile, two-thirds of whom received the vaccine while the rest received a placebo. The previous figure was based on 141 cases, with a cut-off in mid-February. The company added there are 14 additional or probable Covid cases left to be adjudicated. Depending on whether these occurred in the vaccine or placebo group, the final efficacy figure could go up or down a few percentage points. The company added the vaccine efficacy in people 65-years-old and over was 85 percent, but the statistical range for this figure -- anywhere between 58 and 95 percent -- make it less meaningful and the sample size was not mentioned.   Eight cases of severe Covid occurred -- all in the placebo group. AstraZeneca was an early frontrunner in the global race to develop a Covid vaccine, and was heavily favored by the United States, which ordered 300 million doses -- more than its first orders for Moderna's and Pfizer's shots. But a series of communications blunders eroded US agencies' confidence. The US now has three authorized vaccines -- Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson -- and should have enough supply to more than cover the adult population by the end of May. However, authorization by the Food and Drug Administration -- considered the gold standard regulator -- would go a long way to calm global doubts over the AstraZeneca vaccine.   Several European countries paused rollout of the shot over potential blood clot risks before later resuming its use. The European Medicines Agency deemed the vaccine safe and said it was not associated with blood clotting generally -- but added it could not rule out a link to two highly rare forms of clotting, and suggested these risks be mentioned on a warning label. The AstraZeneca vaccine is still seen as vital to vaccinating the world because of its low price and the fact it can be stored long term at fridge temperatures. It uses an adenovirus that causes colds in chimpanzees, modified so it can't replicate, to carry the gene for a key protein of the coronavirus into human cells.   The cells then produce that protein on their surface, training the immune system should it encounter the real virus.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162920", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17181", "source": "scrapy"},

Considering the importance of the examination in admitting post-graduates in their respective subjects for further training, it is in the best interest of candidates to continue to hold this examination on the announced date. Therefore, it has been decided to add further protective measures for the candidates, towards the safe conduct of this examination.\" Candidates are advised to refrain from attending the examination if they are unwell and have COVID-like symptoms or are proven COVID-19 for their own well-being and for the safety of others.It will be mandatory for all candidates to adhere to these instructions as part of COVID Appropriate Behaviour. Same State Centre: In the wake of the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, NBE has increased the number of test centres and testing seats across the country such that candidates who had chosen the option “OTHERS” have been allotted test centres within the state of their correspondence address, thus avoiding any inter-state travel. COVID e-pass: Admit cards being issued to the candidates will bear a COVID e-pass for perusal of police & administrative authorities to facilitate the movement of the candidates in case of any travel-related restrictions. All state departments have been informed regarding the same. Staggered entry of candidates at test centres: To avoid crowding at the test venue entry, there will be staggered time slots for candidates to report. Candidates are required to respect the allotted time slots as communicated individually through emails and SMS. Isolation labs: All candidates will be checked at the entry point for recording of temperature using thermo guns. Candidates detected with above normal temperature or displaying any symptoms of COVID-19 infection will be allowed to take the examination in a separate isolation lab created for this purpose. Compulsory use of face mask: Candidates will not be permitted entry at test centres without an appropriate protective face mask. Candidates will not be allowed to carry any articles with them (such as water bottles, gloves etc) other than the admit card and entry-related documents required for verification purposes. Bottled drinking water will be provided at the test centre. COVID protective gear safety kit: All candidates will be provided with a protective gear safety kit comprising of a face shield, a face mask and five hand sanitizer sachets. It will be mandatory for all candidates to wear the face shield at all times and during entry & exit where crowding is anticipated. Face shield will be required to be taken off during registration process and whenever face ID is verified during the exam. Staggered exit of candidates from test centres: Upon completion of the examination, candidates will be directed to leave the test venue in a staggered manner which will be communicated by the respective centre in-charges in order to avoid crowding at the test venue exit.

After all, isn't this what the pandemic has taught us? That we can, and must work with whatever options we are given. Yes, we are speaking about an easy alternative, such as the replica-grass laden veranda, or the hand-crafted rug placed over the concrete on the rooftop. We can have our mini picnics right at these spots, at the comfort of our very homes, with our loved ones around. A mini basket full of home-baked goodies, fresh fruits and lots of iced tea would enhance our experience. To this, we can add calm retro music or some soothing jazz tunes, especially to match the mood of the afternoon. Few scrambled ideas for the entire day could be to turn the environment into a mini courtyard fit for the queen and the king. Strings of paper lanterns can be used as decorative elements, a splurge can be made out of cushy pillows, decorative furs and a karaoke microphone for singing out loud our favourite tracks.                             At Star Lifestyle, we never miss out on the fashion and the styling suggestions, which we believe, is one of the most integral part of any get-together. This year, try wearing pure-cotton dresses in check prints or the plain khadi for these 'stay-at-home' picnics. Indigo tie-dyes also look brilliant when aesthetically imprinted over the ivory white dress. Make sure you wear a fashionable hat or a matching scarf to match the sensibility of the occasion. Both kitten heels and flats go wonderfully well with the occasion and the loose — flowy, pure  cottons that we suggest you should be wearing. If an occasional pigeon comes now and then, to enjoy your picnic alongside your immediate family, consider your hard-work a success.   \n", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-very-big-1\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/feature/images/2021/04/06/picnic0.jpg?itok=txOdhFGb\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162920", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17367", "source": "scrapy"},

This is when the art connoisseur decided to collaborate with Kamruzzaman Shadhin, Gidree Bawlee Foundation of Arts, to launch 'Bhumi' (Earth), a project to support creative communities of the Thakurgaon district during the COVID-19 crisis. \"I had to start somewhere, and Thakurgaon seemed to be the right place to begin such a mega-scale project, since there are hundreds of traditional craftsmen out there, especially from indigenous communities such as Santals, Rajbongshi and others who were looking for support,\" Durjoy elaborated. This project catered to around 60 families with more than 250 members. The four–month long project had been developed meticulously to tackle the preliminary stages of the economic downturn faced by the resident communities, an after-effect of the sprawling pandemic. \"We planned on the project to help the community of artisans 'up-north' and make their craftsmanship identified and celebrated, to the entire nation. But somehow, luckily, our works surpassed the boundaries and became a worldwide sensation, with popular news outlet CNN featuring our story to the global audience,\" said Durjoy. And true it was, the drone shots of the seed bed by renowned nature photographer, Firoz Al Sabah made several rounds on social media, with praises pouring in from all corners of the world for the remarkable flair of the agricultural farmers. The project also highlighted the works of the jute artisans for their innovative scarecrow construction, the bamboo artisans, the distinctive fabric weavers, and the satranji (handcrafted rug) weavers of the district. \"We took the virgin (never-been-farmed) land on lease, to grow vegetables on a designed seedbed, with 'zero use' of modern-day technology or any sort of harmful pesticides. The seedbed had been shaped in the form of a buffalo and then when we took a drone shot, it turned out to be a huge sensation, with incredible representation of the ancient farming methodologies. My personal feeling is that I have been associated with a huge number of artists over the years, but Bhumi educated me in ways that are beyond comprehension. And I am glad to have been associated with such an auspicious project from the planning stage.\" \"I also want people at large to know that DBF (Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation) does not believe in abandoning a community after a project work is completed; we keep regular contact with the artisans associated with Bhumi till date, and help them through every means possible, whenever necessary,\" he said. Inquired about the future prospects of similar projects, Durjoy revealed that he always wants DBF to be associated with similarly industrious and inspiring projects. \"Art is existent everywhere, in every form in every place and bringing that art to the forefront is our duty. DBF wants to inspire people. My dream is to establish DBF as a platform, where young, rising artists with impeccable talents can come and connect with ease. We are here to represent Bangladesh in its truest form, from the peripheries to the urban cities,\" said Durjoy. At the end of our rendezvous with Durjoy Rahman, we had one question placed in front of him. How do you want people to remember DBF in the long term? \"Just as an institution that is trying hard to make an impact on human lives via art and culture,\" reflected the art connoisseur.   \n", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-6\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/2021/04/05/bhumi1.jpg?itok=hWHbX2Fv&amp;c=34d037ab4a8a63c00c275b64f7375152\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162920", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17907", "source": "scrapy"},

The globally popular social media platform announced the potential new Super Follows service at its annual investor meeting, as it searches for new revenue streams beyond targeted advertising.   \"Exploring audience funding opportunities like Super Follows will allow creators and publishers to be directly supported by their audience and will incentivize them to continue creating content that their audience loves,\" a Twitter spokesperson told AFP. Top Twitter executives discussed Super Follows while outlining goals and plans for the near future during the streamed presentation. \"We are examining and rethinking the incentives of our service -- the behaviors that our product features encourage and discourage as people participate in conversation on Twitter,\" the spokesperson said. Super Follows was described during the presentation as a way for Twitter audiences to financially support creators and receive newsletters, exclusive content and even virtual badges in exchange.   Twitter, which currently makes money from ads and promoted posts, might be able to add additional revenue via the Super Follows transactions. Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi was not convinced people will be inclined to pay for special content on Twitter. Such a model makes sense for content on platforms like YouTube, where hours of craftsmanship might be devoted to producing entertaining videos, but it is debatable whether the same could be said for tweets on Twitter, she said. No timeline was given for when Super Follows might become a feature, but it is expected that the tech giant will make further announcements in the coming months.   Twitter is also considering allowing users to join communities devoted to topics via a feature seemingly similar to Facebook's \"groups.\" Twitter aims to reach a milestone of 315 million \"monetizable\" users in 2023, a steep increase from the 192 million it had at the end of last year, according to a filing with US financial markets regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The San Francisco-based firm defined monetizable users as people who log in daily and can be shown ads. Twitter, like Google and Facebook, makes most of its money from digital advertising. The company said it is aiming for $7.5 billion in revenue in 2023, more than double the $3.7 billion it took in last year.   Twitter also plans to double \"development velocity,\" meaning the number of new features it releases per employee to get people to engage more with the service. Twitter revenue product lead Bruce Falck told analysts that the tech company was mindful of a potential crimp in revenue that could be caused by new privacy labels Apple is mandating for apps on its mobile devices. App makers are concerned that the labels will discourage users from allowing collection of data used to more effectively target ads. \"It's still too early to tell exactly how this will impact the industry, but it will be felt by the entire industry,\" Falck said, adding that Twitter was innovating to soften the blow.   Twitter's plan to boost revenue also includes getting more involved in online commerce. \"Imagine easily discovering and quickly purchasing a new skincare product, or trendy sneaker from a brand new follow with only a few clicks,\" a Twitter executive told analysts.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162920", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17169", "source": "scrapy"},

The girl, whose name is withheld as per request, visited the hospital with complaints of abdominal distension, which was associated with mild pain. The abdominal swelling started 4-5 years ago and was slowly increasing in size. Since last year, the tumour started to rapidly increase in size and started causing discomfort to the girl and she was having pain and difficulty in breathing. However, due to fear of COVID-19, the patient's family reportedly did not approach any hospital to seek medical care. In March, the family finally visited Sir Ganga Ram hospital and met Dr Tarun Mittal (laparoscopic and bariatric surgeon), Department of General and Laparoscopic Surgery one week before the surgery. “An urgent CT scan was done to find the nature and origin of the swelling, which showed a large lobulated mass (30x20x14cm) in the retroperitoneal area,” he said. After proper evaluation and counseling of the parents and the girl, surgery was planned and the two tumours were operated on 25 March with full precautions, the surgeon said. In a successful surgery, which lasted three hours, the doctor said the tumours were fully removed. The surgical team was led by Tarun Mittal along with Dr Ashish Dey and Dr Anmol Ahuja, and the anesthetist team included Dr Jayashree Sood and Dr Ajay Sirohi. “The tumour was completely excised and measured 32x22 cm and weighed 5kg.

I have lived in Chauras, Srinagar Garhwal for most of my life, but forest fires have frequently been recurring only in the last few years. A couple of months back, around mid-October, I had reported the fire around my locality. The forest has been burning since, over and over again. People would normally assume that those living in the mountains are habituated with fire, but are we really? Having witnessed several forest fires, I can say that the fires this year are unusual, because we had less rain this season and the winter was extremely dry. The situation will get worse in peak summer months. This should be a wake up call – the Himalayas need saving. I am a wildlife researcher and for the past seven years, I have been working in the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttarakhand. During my research, I hadn’t witnessed a single forest fire but this year, this part of the state is also burning. Be it reserved forest land or community land, the state government has received reports on fires from everywhere. In a forest area a couple of minutes away from my home that I visited on 7 April, I could only see dry forest road covered with ash. The fire started near the human settlement and went up to the forest, having a drastic effect on the entire ecosystem and the condition of animals and plants. Moreover, the smoke here is toxic and harmful for human health. I have personally faced health issues because of prolonged smoke and decided to leave the town. People around my area are also reporting respiratory illness and burning in their eyes due to the smoke. Health consequences of the fires figure a lot in local conversations, but there is little attention paid to them. Besides environmental or natural reasons, there are two other reasons I can propose as a native here. First, accidental reasons, like people who throw small parties or have a bonfire inside the forest and leave the fire unattended, or it can be due to the burning of crops by villagers at the edge of the forest. These accidental reasons can be a cause for a one-time fire. However, the reasons for periodic fires must be investigated from a human angle. Most of the time there are people who intentionally start a fire for mental satisfaction. People here usually know there is one person responsible but villagers don’t want to disclose it. That person could even be a patient of pyromania, a disorder where the affected sets fire to things deliberately. Therefore, other than traditional reasons for a forest fire, we need to pay attention to deliberate fires to understand this deep down and remove it from the root. Though the government has additional penalties for miscreants now, people are not aware of it. I believe more awareness and strong punishment is an imperative need.

The size of the economy had shrunken in the April-June quarter and July-September quarter, pulling down the country into a technician recession. However, the positive growth — though not very strong yet — has taken the Indian economy out of the recession. A consistent growth in consumer demand, festive spends and a jump in government expenditure appear to have supported the Covid-battered economy to spring back into the positive territory. The expenditure trend, however, remains weak as government and private consumption expenditure continued to contract in the third quarter.   \"The GDP at constant (2011-12) prices in Q3 of 2020-21 is estimated at Rs 36.22 lakh crore, as against Rs 36.08 lakh crore in Q3 of 2019-20, showing a growth of 0.4 per cent,\" data released by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation showed on Friday. The Indian economy had grown at the rate of 4.7 per cent in the same quarter last year. According to the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), the farm sector recorded a growth of 3.9 per cent, and the manufacturing sector output grew by 1.6 per cent. The construction sector advanced by 6.2 per cent, while electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services clocked a 7.3 per cent growth.   Trade, hotels, transport, communications and services related to broadcasting continued to bore the brunt of post-Covid consumer behaviour. These segments posted a 7.7 per cent contraction in the third quarter. Economists and rating firms had widely expected India's GDP to grow in the third quarter on the back of higher economic activity and reducing the number of coronavirus cases in the country. They are also hopeful that India's economic growth in the fourth quarter will improve further due to the mass vaccination drive that started in the country in January. While the third-quarter data suggested buoyancy in the economy, the NSO revised its growth projection for the fiscal 2020-21 marginally downwards by 30 basis points or 0.30 per cent.   Compared to the projection of 7.7 per cent of degrowth in January, the government expects the economy to degrow by eight per cent, signalling a weaker than expected rebound in the March quarter. The NSO, however, added a disclaimer stating that the measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic have impacted the economic activities as well as the data collection mechanisms. “Estimates, therefore, are likely to undergo sharp revisions for the aforesaid causes in due course.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162925", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16708", "source": "scrapy"},

Brands including Panasonic, Haier and Thomson are considering to increase prices from April this year, while some like LG have already raised prices due to hike in prices of open-cell.   Panasonic India and South Asia President and CEO Manish Sharma said, \"Panel prices are rising continuously and so are the prices of TVs. It is likely that TV prices may increase further by April.\" When being asked about the quantum on increase, he said, \"Seeing current trends, it might go up 5-7 per cent more by April.\" Expressing similarly, Haier Appliances India President Eric Braganza said there is no other way than to increase the prices. \"The prices of open-cell have gone up tremendously and the trends are that it would keep on increasing,\" said Braganza adding that \"if that continues, we would have to continuously increase prices\".   The open-cell panel is an important part of TV manufacturing and covers around 60 per cent of the unit. Companies import television panels in an open-cell state, which require further assembling with value addition before being shipped to market for sale. Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd (SPPL), the brand licensee for French Electronics brand Thomson and US-based brand Kodak, said there is a scarcity of open cell in the market and the prices have almost gone up by three-folds in the past eight months. \"From the past eight months, there has been a month-on-month increase in panel prices, we have witnessed more than 350 per cent spike in LED TV panels. Globally, panel market has slowed down. Despite that, there has been an increase of 35 per cent in the past 30 days,\" said SPPL Chief Executive Officer Avneet Singh Marwah.   He added that the per-unit cost of TVs would go up by at least Rs 2,000-3,000 starting from April. Videotex International, which owns Daiwa and Shinco brands, said the industry has never seen or expected such a price increase of open-cell. \"Since 32 inch is the most-sold size in India, the price of a 32-inch screen size is expected to go up by Rs 5,000-6,000,\" said Videotex International Group Director Arjun Bajaaj. While South Korean brand LG said it will not increase the prices of its TV panels. \"We are not going for any price increase now for TV. We have already increased the prices by around 7-4 per cent in January and 3 per cent in February, because of the hike in panel prices,\" said LG Electronics India Vice-President (Home Appliances) Vijay Babu.   Marwah added that the open-cell market is dominated by Chinese manufacturers and alleged that TV makers from China are getting better prices from them. \"Currently, there is no alternative apart from China where all panel manufacturers are present. It has been closely observed that only Chinese brands are getting better supply and price. \"This has been the narrative especially after the pandemic, where Chinese TV brands, which have been flooded in the Indian market to counter Indian manufacture brands by better price and supply,\" he added. The government should bring TV manufacturing under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, a move which will make the Indian TV industry more competitive on the global stage, Marwah added.   Last year, the government had restored the import duty on open cell. It had re-imposed 5 per cent customs duty on the import of open-cell for TVs from October 1, 2020, after having nil duty for a year. Besides, the government had also put imports of TV under a restricted category from free to promote domestic manufacturing. Now, importer of TV has to seek a licence from the commerce ministry's DGFT for the imports. TV is one of the largest segments under the entire domain of appliance and consumer electronics, accounting for a volume of almost 17 million with an estimated sale value of almost Rs 25,000 crore. According to a joint report by the industry body, CEAMA and Frost & Sullivan, the TV market is expected to grow to 284 lakh units in 2024-25 from 175 lakh units in 2018-19.   It further said that the open cell panel and the chips of the TV are predominantly imported from China besides some other markets as Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam and only the last-mile assembly is done in India.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162926", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17001", "source": "scrapy"},

By 11am, it rose to 21.65. At 1pm, it was 37.26 and by 3pm, the poll percentage was recorded at 47.42. Polling was peaceful all over the state with the exception of stray incidents or minor violence in some parts. Voters were seen standing in long queues braving the sweltering heat at several polling stations to cast their vote. In Nellore district, a BJP supporter dumped a ballot box in a water tub at Ponugodu village of Anuma Samudram Peta mandal falling under Atmakur assembly segment following a row with the ruling party agents over helping the aged people to reach polling station to cast their votes.   District collector KVN Chakradhar Babu announced the repoll in the village on Friday. Tellagunta villagers of Bogole mandal boycotted the polling to express their protest over not providing drinking water facilities in the village. In Prakasam district, the car of Darsi MLA Maddisetty Venugopal’s brother Ravindra was damaged as he went to Sivaramapuram village in Tallur mandal to see the polling trend. In West Godavari, a voter identified as Seshadri Venkata Durga Prasad was arrested by the Undi police as he tried to pour ink on ballot papers at the 32nd polling station in the village.   In East Godavari, polling was stopped for some time at a polling station located Sakurru village in Amalapuram as the ‘Glass’ symbol of Jana Sena party was not printed on the ballot paper. The problem was rectified and the polling was continued. A retired woman teacher Nrisimhadevara Simhachalam died while waiting for an auto-rickshaw to reach a polling station to cast her vote at Katrenikona. Police booked a case against a voter Kasi Venkata Ramana for taking a selfie with the ballot paper at a polling station at Pallamkurru village in Katrenikona mandal. The election authorities declared his vote as invalid.   In Vizianagaram district, polling was stopped in three stations in Anti Peta polling centre in Seethanagaram mandal as the voters found the name of YSR Congress dummy nominee Senapati Lakshmi in the ballot paper for MPTC polls though the official nominee was Senapati Nirmala. A repoll is likely to be held on Friday. Several adivasis in Visakhapatnam and other places faced a tough time to reach the polling stations for want of proper road connectivity. Hundreds of them crossed Matyasagedda in Arasu mandal to reach the polling stations. In Kurnool, two groups of voters entered into heated arguments at Devanakonda as some of them tried to resort to cross-voting. Police rushed to the spot and restored normalcy.   In Kadapa, at Utpativaripalle of Badvel mandal, YSR Congress supporters acted as agents at a polling station instead of TD activists, forcing the TD nominee Sirisha Reddy and the party agents to stage a protest. TD agents alleged that the signatures on the forms were not theirs. In Rajuvaripeta of Chapadu mandal, YSR Congress activists did not allow a TD agent to sit in the polling station. MPTC nominee Rajeshwari tried to disrupt the polling, forcing the police to take her into custody. In Guntur, TD activists from Gonepudi and Palapadu villages staged a protest in front of Narasaraopeta sub collector’s office, alleging that their polling agents were not being allowed to enter the polling stations by the YSR Congress leaders with the support from CI Krishnaiah.   The villagers from both the villages demanded a repoll and sought suspension of the CI.

The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to prepare for the launch of such workplace vaccination. According to news agency  , Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries said a substantial proportion of the population aged 45 years and above is in the organised sector of the economy and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private) or manufacturing and services. \"In order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations,   vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing COVID vaccination centre,\" Bhushan said in the letter . He said the states can initiate due consultations with private/public sector employers and management to prepare for launch of workplace vaccination. \"Such workplace vaccination centres may be launched across states/Union Territories from 11 April, 2021,\" he said. The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to make adequate preparations and issued guidelines in this regard. According to the government's guidance note, workplace vaccination sessions may be organised to facilitate optimal utilization of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage. \"Organizing vaccination at the workplace will not only be convenient to the staff at workplaces but also help to avoid travel and hence reducing the risk of exposure to   virus,\" it said. According to the guidelines, only employees aged 45 years or more will be eligible for vaccination at workplaces and no outsiders including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination. One of the senior staff of the organisation will be assigned to work as nodal officer to coordinate with district health authorities/ private COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) and support vaccination activities. The beneficiaries will be required to register in Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination and CVC nodal officer will ensure registration of all targeted beneficiaries and facility of on-the-spot registration will also be available but only to employees of the workplace, the guidelines said. Once identified, the workplace   vaccination centres will also have to register on the Co-WIN portal as government or private CVC at workplace. For optimal utilisation of resources, vaccination sessions will be planned at workplace CVC once at least 50 beneficiaries get registered for vaccination. \"The schedule of vaccination sessions can be made up to 15 days in advance and intimated to the workplaces so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of vaccination. In most of the workplaces vaccination schedules may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,\" the Centre told states and union territories in the guidelines. The District Task Force chaired by district magistrate and Urban Task Force chaired by municipal commissioner will identify such government and private workplaces after due deliberations with relevant employers. Every CVC in a government workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the government medical facility while every CVC in a private workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the private medical facility. The designated government and private CVC to whom the workplace CVC has been tagged will be responsible for the deployment of the vaccination team at workplace CVCs. All government and private CVCs are already linked to some cold chain points for receiving vaccines. \"These CVCs will continue to use the same mechanism to receive the vaccine needed for vaccination at tagged workplace CVC,\" the guidelines said. \"Some of the work places may have health infrastructure in form of hospitals, health clinics, nursing centers, etc. This infrastructure may be utilized to set-up vaccination site in case sufficient space for waiting, vaccination and observation rooms are available,\" the guidelines stated. The healthcare workers of this health infrastructure of the workplace CVCs (such as doctors, nurses and other staff) may be deployed for the   vaccination activities at workplaces as vaccination team members, it said. The workplace CVCs staff engaged in   vaccination activities will follow the same SOPs for vaccination and reporting including management and reporting of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The government has also spelled out the requirements for AEFI management at the workplace CVCs. In order to avoid mixing of vaccine types in first and second dose, only one type of vaccine will be provided at such sessions that are conducted at the workplaces. While the anti-   vaccination at government workplaces organised by district health authorities will be free of cost, inoculation organised by private CVC would be on payment basis and will be charged the same rate as that for vaccination at private health facility (Rs 250 per person per dose).  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Centre to allow COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces having 100 eligible beneficiaries from 11 April\" alt=\"Centre to allow COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces having 100 eligible beneficiaries from 11 April\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Covid-Vaccination_PTI_640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162926", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Its UK counterpart, however, said it would offer people under 30 the choice of another product. The European Medicines Agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. It said most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination — but based on the currently available evidence, it was not able to identify specific risk factors. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the United Kingdom, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. “The reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine,” said Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director. But it placed no new age restrictions on using the vaccine in people 18 and over, as some countries have done. “The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects.,” Cooke said. Dr. June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, echoed that sentiment, saying that the benefits “continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.” She called the unusual clots a “potential side effect” of the vaccine and said the evidence was “firming up,” but more study was needed to be sure. The EMA, the World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against   outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots. The announcements could have far-reaching effects on the use of the shot that is key to global efforts to end the pandemic. The EMA's investigation was particularly focused on two types of rare blood clots: one that appears in multiple blood vessels and another that occurs in a vein that drains blood from the brain. It also evaluated reports of people who had low levels of blood platelets, which puts them at risk of severe bleeding. As recently as last week, the EMA said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population” — a response to several countries doing just that — though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected. In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine. Meanwhile, Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, never suspended use of the vaccine. The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic. Dr Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine globally could have serious consequences. “We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said. That’s because the vaccine is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries. It has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine. The governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region had said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot. “If they do like Germany, and allow Astra Zeneca only to people over 65, that would be absurd. Before it was only for people under 55. Put yourself in the place of citizens, it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters on Wednesday. The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary. “If there are in fact individuals of a certain age group that could have a higher risk (of clotting) then we need to adjust its use,” Casado told Spanish public radio. “We are not questioning AstraZeneca. We need all the vaccines possible to reach the goal of 70% of the adult population.” French health authorities said they, too, were awaiting EMA’s conclusions and would follow the agency’s recommendations, especially for the 500,000 people who have received the first dose of AstraZeneca. Even officials in Asia said they were keen to hear the EMA's decision. On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said it would also pause a vaccine rollout to school nurses and teachers that was to begin on Thursday while awaiting the outcome of the EMA’s review. English, the former chair of a British Medical Association committee, said that even rare, serious side effects are seen with established vaccines and that policymakers often decide that bigger public health goals warrant their use, citing the polio vaccine as an example. For every million doses that are given of the oral polio vaccine, about one child is paralyzed from the live virus contained in the vaccine. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which developed the vaccine, paused a study of the shot in children while the U.K. regulator evaluates the link between the shot and rare blood clots in adults.", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\" alt=\"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/astrazeneca-AP.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162927", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "35264", "source": "scrapy"},

According to an update by the UK drug regulator dated February 22, the shelf-life of the AstraZeneca   vaccine is six months. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the vaccine as the European Union's health agency concluded a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and rare blood clots but stressed that the benefits of the vaccine to protect against   continue to outweigh the risks. The UK's medicines regulator on Wednesday said that under-30s in the country will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to \"evolving evidence\" linking it to rare blood clots. Developed by Oxford University and Swedish-British pharma major AstraZeneca, Covishield is being manufactured by SII.", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"WHO rejects SII’s proposal seeking extension of Covishield’s shelf life from 6 to 9 months\" alt=\"WHO rejects SII’s proposal seeking extension of Covishield’s shelf life from 6 to 9 months\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Covaxin-Covishield-Vaccine-COVID_PTI.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162927", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "40004", "source": "scrapy"},

Unlike the cartoon train's face, Dobo's is blistered and scrunched as she struggles for breath, her eyes shuttered and weeping. The three-year-old is going blind. Cradled by her mother, Dobo lies in the ward of a health centre in a remote town in northern Democratic Republic of Congo where mosquito nets on sticks droop over rusting metal beds, and doctors work frantically to contain a deadly virus. Dobo does not have the new coronavirus or Ebola. She has measles, a preventable but extremely contagious disease that since January 2019 has ripped through Congo unchecked into remote regions. Some 6,400 people have died, according to official figures, though healthcare workers say the number is likely much higher because reporting rates are so low.   \"I feel guilty because I’m afraid people might say it’s because I didn't get my daughter treatment quickly,\" Dobo’s mother Wanea Mabele said over her writhing child’s rattling breath. Mabele is hardly to blame. Underfunded and delayed government vaccination drives in the vast Central African nation have left millions of hard-to-reach children vulnerable. Dud vaccines have left thousands of others at risk without knowing, local and international health workers say, in a nation of 81 million people that is ten times the size of Britain. Complicating matters, authorities have funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars and manpower into a 19-month Ebola outbreak in the east that has killed over 2,000 people, weakening efforts to contain measles, health officials say. Ebola is finally on the wane, but COVID-19 threatens to steal the limelight. After a first case in the capital Kinshasa this month, reported infections rose to 18 by the weekend. \"Priority will be given to COVID-19 in the coming weeks or months depending on the trend of the disease. Consequently, we will face challenges in resources mobilization for measles,\" said Vincent Sodjinou, who leads the measles response for the World Heath Organization (WHO). Measles is on the rise globally, but Congo is worst hit. The disease, contracted when a carrier coughs or sneezes, carries risks of brain damage, blindness and deafness. Dobo’s ward sits among the palm and mango trees of Busu-Mandji, a dilapidated old colonial town deep in the jungle, 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) from Kinshasa. The nearest paved road is 125 km south in the city of Lisala. Keeping vaccines refrigerated for the duration of the journey from the capital is vital but tricky. On a recent vaccination campaign, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) flew 2,700 vials to Lisala in large cool boxes fitted with digital thermometers to ensure the temperature remains between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius in the equatorial heat. In Lisala, the boxes were lashed to the back of a dozen motorbikes for a ten-hour ride along bamboo-thronged dirt tracks and precarious log bridges too pitted for 4X4 vehicles. During the 10-hour ride to Busu-Mandji, the convoy was halted by three flat tyres, engine trouble and a broken chain. MSF workers said the vaccines remained in the right temperature range. Congo's government has year-round vaccination campaigns, but there was no emergency response targeting high risk areas until an October-December 2019 campaign. When the government vaccines did finally come, health workers say some may have overheated. Malnutrition and poorly-trained health workers make the vaccine, normally 85% effective, less efficient. The health ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Mada Maddow lives at the edge of Macau, a village near Busu-Mandji where front gardens are peppered with tiny plots of freshly-turned earth, each a child's grave. Her seven children were vaccinated in the December campaign, she said, but they all subsequently contracted measles. One died. It is unclear why the vaccines failed. Official statistics suggest 100% of children have been vaccinated in the area, said Mushadi Gidion, a local official from the health ministry. But that calculation is based on 1984 census data: health workers have no idea how many children actually need vaccinating, and there is no data on the effectiveness of the vaccine after it is administered in this setting. \"There can be many causes that can lead to the epidemic,\" Mushadi said. \"Perhaps our vaccination campaign was not of high quality.\"", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/23/134045-untitled-design-3.jpg?itok=aYRidL2C\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162925", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22997", "source": "scrapy"},

Apple has partnered with third-party manufacturers like Foxconn and Wistron to make some of its phones in India. These include iPhone SE, iPhone 10R and iPhone 11.   \"Apple is dedicated to making the best products and services in the world to delight our customers...We are proud to be starting production of iPhone 12 in India for our local customers, Apple said in a statement. While the Cupertino-based company did not name the supplier partners, sources said Foxconn will be making the iPhone 12 at a facility in Tamil Nadu. Comments from Foxconn could not be immediately elicited. Apple had started manufacturing iPhones in India in 2017 with iPhone SE. In a tweet, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: \"Nice to see our efforts to make India a big hub of mobile and components manufacturing is attracting global attention. This will create jobs in large numbers.\"   Apple, which competes with players like Samsung and OnePlus in the premium smartphone segment, has been aggressively ramping up its presence in the Indian market. In December last year, a section of workers at Wistron Corporation's manufacturing facility in Narasapura Industrial Area near Bengaluru - which assembles the latest version of the iPhone SE at the plant - went on a rampage over non-payment of their wages. At that time, Apple had said Wistron had been placed on probation and that the contract manufacturer will not receive any new business from the US-based company before corrective actions are completed. In the past, Apple has highlighted that it sees growth opportunities in the Indian market.   In January, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook had stated that the company has doubled its business in India in the December quarter on the back of the strong performance of its online store and that the tech giant sees a good growth trajectory going ahead. \"India is one of those, where our share is quite low. It did improve from the year-ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled over that period of time. And so, we feel very good about the trajectory. We are doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example, and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store,\" Cook had said. Apple also plans to set up brick-and-mortar outlets in India in addition to the online store as the iPhone maker looks to further cement its position in one of the world's biggest smartphone markets.   In the past, Apple has stated that it is keen on offering online and in-store experiences to Indian users that are at par with its global standards and that it aims to open its maiden retail store in India. The growth seen by Apple has been noted by research firms like Counterpoint. According to Counterpoint, Apple captured the sixth spot in terms of shipment in India in the October-December 2020 quarter with 171 per cent year-on-year growth, and 93 per cent growth in 2020 over the previous year. The report had pointed out that the launch of the iPhone 12, aggressive offers on the iPhone SE 2020 and iPhone 11, and online expansion had driven this growth. For the first time, the brand crossed 1.5 million shipments in a single quarter, it further noted.   Apple had clocked about a 29 per cent jump in its revenues in India at Rs 13,755.8 crore, while its net profit witnessed manifold growth to Rs 926.2 crore in financial year 2020 over the previous fiscal, as per regulatory documents.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162927", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16904", "source": "scrapy"},

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also written to the education minister to consider the demands of students for cancelling the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams. Vadra said that its 'shocking' that the CBSE has decided to go ahead with exams despite parents expressing fears and 'apprehensions' about assembling at exam centres in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. She said these 'apprehensions' are not 'Unreasonable', so exams should be cancelled. She, in her letter said, \"It will be practically impossible to ensure the safety of students at large and at crowded exam centres. Additionally, given the nature and the spread of the virus, it is not just the students who will be at risk but also their teachers, invigilators and family members who are in contact with them. Aside from this, by forcing the children to sit for these exams during a raging pandemic, the Government and the CBSE board will be held responsible in the event that any of the exam centres prove to be hotspots at which large numbers of children become infected with the disease.\" The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has also appealed to the Centre to take a uniform decision on the board exams of Classes 10 and 12 across the country in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A unilateral decision by any state would lead to students of that state being at a disadvantage in terms of career and opportunities, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said in a letter, dated April 10, addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. \"Your intervention would mean national consensus, instead of a unilateral decision by any particular state,\" Sawant said in his letter. The exams are due in a few days which will put several students and their families, teachers and non-teaching staff at high risk, he said. According to the revised date sheet for CBSE board exams 2021, the Class 10 exams would be held between May 4 and June 7 and those for Class 12 would be held between May 4 and June 15.

The service will also see the presence of Prince Philip’s grandson Prince Harry who will reunite with his family to pay his last respects to his grandfather. However, his wife,   will be giving the funeral a miss. Meghan will not be attending Prince Philip’s last rites as pregnant with the couple’s second child. Page Six confirmed that the Duchess of Sussex who is is due to give birth to the couple’s second child, a girl, in early summer will stay home in California on her doctor’s advice, Buckingham Palace announced. Infact, a source close to the royals said that Markle hoped to be at his husband’s side, but the trip and the 12-hour flight were deemed potentially too taxing. \"The Duke of Sussex is planning to attend. The Duchess of Sussex has been advised by her physician not to travel. So the duke will be attending,\" a royal spokesman said at a press briefing, using Harry’s other title. Buckingham Palace announced on Friday (April 9) that Philip, the longtime husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died \"peacefully\" at Windsor Castle at the age of 99, just two months short of his 100th birthday. Philip became the queen’s consort, or official companion, after her father, King George VI, suddenly passed in 1952. He was the longest-serving British consort over his 73-year marriage to the queen.  Gun salutes were fired earlier on Saturday across the UK, in Gibraltar and at sea in memory of the duke, who was a senior figure in the navy before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.  (With ANI inputs)", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162921", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34041", "source": "scrapy"},

Kenya bought $23.2 million worth of frozen fish from China in 2018, according to the International Trade Center, almost all of its fish imports. Fishermen have long complained that the cheap imports were strangling local trade. The coronavirus has slowed Chinese imports. Nervous customers have turned to local fish. But Kenya will soon face shortages unless imports from China resume; it produces just over a third of what it consumes.   Kenyan fishermen like 38-year-old Maurice Misodhi, whose skin has been weathered by the sun and wind during two decades on the water, have had a bumper month. Based at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, customers want every fish he catches. Misodhi says the Chinese lockdown seemed to have dried up imports of cheaper Chinese fish. \"As fishermen we can now smile, not because people are suffering from coronavirus, but because we can now sell our fish, and at a good price,\" he said. The price of a kilo of Nile perch - 250 shillings ($2.50) a month ago - has shot up to 350 shillings. Fish trader Mary Didi usually buys from Chinese suppliers but has now turned to Misodhi. \"The supply at the Chinese importers has gone down, and many of my customers were also scared of the Chinese fish, thinking they would contract the virus,\" she said. \"To keep the business running, I had to turn to fish from the lake.\" Bob Otieno, chairman of Dunga Beach Management Unit, says sales have shot up. The beach registers a catch of between 1 and 1.5 tonnes of fish each day and sales have gone up from 50% of the catch to 90% in the last two weeks. Previously, fishermen would eat, barter or give away around half their catch. \"We used to have many fishermen sell their catch at low prices because of competition from the Chinese fish,\" he said. Kenya produces 180,000 tonnes per year but consumes about 500,000 tonnes, according to 2019 government figures. Christine Adhiambo, the government's assistant director of fisheries for the lake region, said the two biggest importers of Chinese fish had not shipped from China since November and were running down stocks. Kenya could face shortages soon, she said. \"Kenya cannot satisfy its local fish demand,\" she said. \"That is why we heavily rely on supplements from China.\"  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/23/134056-untitled-design-2.jpg?itok=qVGmVpZ0\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162928", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21709", "source": "scrapy"},

While announcing the decision, the Centre said that they will continue to announce DA on time but it won't get added to central government employee's salary till June 2021. However, the three installments of DAs - January to June 2020, July to December 2020 and January to June 2021 - will be restored and they will be added to CGS' salary and it will further increase the monthly PF contribution or PF balance in the long term. How? Monthly Provident Fund (PF) contribution is calculated on the basis of a central government's basic salary plus DA. The DA hike will lead to rise in one's monthly PF contribution. As per the AICPI (All India Consumer Price Index) latest data, a 4 percent DA hike for January to June 2021, 3 percent DA for January to June 2020, and 4 percent DA for July to December 2020 can be expected to get added in central government employees' existing DA, which is currently at 17 percent. If the DA is not delayed anymore, then it can go up to 28 percent from 17 percent. The rise in DA from 17 percent to 28 percent will further increase the PF contribution and it will also make changes in the employees' monthly salary as monthly PF contribution is decided on the basis of one's basic salary plus DA.

To strive through such times along with extreme competition is a big task in itself and example of such an accomplishment is  .   was the initial spark blazed by The Tewari Group. The idea of SportVolt was introduced and implemented in the year 2016 by  . The fundamental concept behind SportVolt was to make India a sports superpower. “The aim was to focus on the grassroots level and identify and harness the talent that is currently overlooked’ tells Mr.Tewari. Kshitij was turned down by numerous investors before finally deciding to go ahead with the project based of a small family loan of 500 USD. Chasing the vision and not the money, Kshitij led SportVolt into being a profitable enterprise since the year of its inception with a projected revenue of 3 Million USD in FY20-21 and has already secured a revenue of 1 Million USD in the first two quarter. Under the guidance of his father, Col  , an army veteran and a UNESCO awardee, the team then decided to expand operations with the establishment of   an organisation dedicated towards trading and promoting locally made products. “We wanted to take the same sentiment and work ethic and leverage our grassroots network to identify and promote industries with local ownerships” states Mr. Raghav Sharma, Director at RushKash. Both ventures soon saw various additions came in their respective portfolios. SportVolt entered the healthcare, manpower and capacity building sectors. ‘With a core competency in personnel training, manpower and capacity building seemed like an obvious choice, and being involved with sports and wellness, healthcare was a sector we always had an inkling towards’ says Kshitij. RushKash has also observed the addition of realty services in its project operations. Kshitij and his team were all set to enter a new phase of expansion with plans to enter the defense sector but due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, those plans were derailed. The team decided to regroup and design a fresh strategy. This led towards the advent of Tewari Enterprises, with Col Prakash Tewari at the helm. In no time   came to fruition and is now moulding its way in GIS and GPS based tech and bulletproofing solutions. “Our aim through the Tewari Group is to consolidate all our operations and have them working in synchronicity and deliver bundled experiences as opposed to a single point deliverable” expresses Col Tewari, who has previously served as the Executive Director – CSR for DLF Ltd, prior to which he had served in identical roles at Jindal Steel and Power and Tata Power Company.

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162930", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16252", "source": "scrapy"},

Human Rights Watch and Belady: An Island for Humanity in report which was released today claim that the legal system ignored the abuse. The report titled “No one cared he was a child: Egyptian Security Forces’ Abuse of Children in Detention” claims 20 children aged 12-17 were arrested and abused by forces. “The harrowing accounts of these children and their families reveal how Egypt’s machinery of repression has subjected children to grave abuses,” said Aya Hijazi, co-director of Belady.  “Egyptian authorities act as though they are above all laws when it comes to children in detention”, Hijazi added. Based on the account mentioned on the Human Rights Watch website, 15 out of 20 children claim to have been tortured during interrogation. A child was also badly assaulted during the process. As many as seven children claim that they were tortured using sophisticated electricity driven tools like stun guns. “Egyptian authorities act as though they are above all laws when it comes to children in detention”, Hijazi added. Many children were tied with arms behind their backs which led to the dislocation of their shoulders. A 14-year-old boy claimed that his joints had be put back into place with manipulation from another prison, who is allegedly a doctor. Many human rights abuses have been reported under the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Even though most abuse was allegedly committed by the National Security Agency’s officers, the police and army have also been complicit.   “Children are describing being waterboarded and electrocuted on their tongues and genitals, and yet Egypt’s security forces are facing no consequences,” said Bill Van Esveld, associate children’s rights director at Human Rights Watch.  Many human rights abuses have been reported under the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Even though most abuse was allegedly committed by the National Security Agency’s officers, the police and army have also been complicit. “Governments that want to end these horrors should end support to Egyptian security services and condition any future agreements on there being real reforms”, Esveld added. Even though children were put into detention, their families were not informed. Many of them were missing in action for over 13 months.  A child was given the death sentence, which is in direct violation of international human rights protocols in place. Additionally, three were indefinitely put in solitary confinement. When families tried to reach out to their kids, their requests were denied. Many narratives claim that there was not enough room for everybody to sleep, owing to which most kids slept in shifts. A harrowing account released by Human Rights Watch suggests that kids were threatened were re-detention if they didn’t confess to the crime they were being held for. According to Egyptian law, all detainees have to be presented in front of a prosecutor within 24 hours of taking them into custody. However, the authorities circumvented this law by claiming that the kids were “arrested”. The law states that children cannot be tried before criminal courts, however, two kids were tried in military courts, which clearly disregards the law in place. Under the 1996 Child Law and the subsequent amendments, special protection is accorded to children, and they cannot be detained and penalised along the same lines as adults. A loophole in the Child Law enables officers to send children to criminal courts if their accomplices were adults, which is abused to prosecute children. According to the human rights group, the allies of Egypt, including the US and many European countries need to end their support to the country in order for them to be held accountable for their trespassing.

This sentiment was echoed by Amelia Direito, a spokesperson for the National Migration Service in Tete.   Direito had heard noises coming from inside of the lorry, which raised suspicion. After this, the lorry was stopped and inspected.

After a nail-biting election day that extended by nearly a week, Democrat Joe Biden finally won the mantle of the 46th president of the United States of America on Saturday, 7 November, after a victory in Pennsylvania. Soon after the victory, Biden took to Twitter to say, “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country”. The Biden Campaign also released a statement from the president-elect on Saturday, in which he said, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.” Several US networks projected Biden as having won the presidential race after securing the key battleground of Pennsylvania, which helped him cross the 270 votes needed to win. With 20 electoral votes from the state, Biden now has a total of 273 electoral votes. He ran for president in 1988 but withdrew after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British leader Neil Kinnock. Biden ran for the presidency again in 2008 but later withdrew from the race. The candidates had been locked in a virtual dead heat for days, and  reported that Trump’s chances of winning a second term depended on his ability to hang on to his leads in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania. However, Biden narrowed the gap in both states as vote counting progressed, finally winning Pennsylvania with 49.7 percent of the vote, as opposed to Trump’s 49.2 percent. Once he had gained ground in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia on Thursday he got to closer to defeating President Trump. “Democracy is sometimes messy. It sometimes requires a little patience as well. But that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance that’s been the envy of the world,” Biden had said as he awaited the results.", "image_url": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/joe-biden-4.jpg\" class=\"attachment- size- wp-post-image\" alt=\"Joe Biden\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/joe-biden-4.jpg 1200w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/joe-biden-4-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/joe-biden-4-1024x569.jpg 1024w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/joe-biden-4-768x427.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162930", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Customers will be inconvenienced to get services such as cash withdrawals, deposits, cheque clearances, remittance services. Government transactions related to treasury as well as business transactions will also be impacted.   United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions, had given a strike call for March 15 and 16. Members of UFBU include All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Confederation of India (BEFI). Others are the Indian National Bank Employees Federation (INBEF), Indian National Bank Officers Congress (INBOC), National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO). Unions on Monday said nearly 10 lakh staffers across the country have participated in the strike, terming it a \"success\".   Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Union Budget speech for 2021-22 said the government will privatise two more public sector banks going forward. The government has already privatised IDBI Bank by selling its majority stake in the lender to LIC in 2019, and has merged 14 public sector banks in the last four years. As per the call, on Monday, employees and officers joined the strike and the strike was a total success. Normal banking services were affected because of the strike, C H Venkatachalam, General Secretary, AIBEA said. Today (Tuesday) too, as per reports received by us from our unions in various states, the strike has been successful. Overwhelming majority of the bank branches remain closed and shutters are down,\" he added.   He said the young employees have been in the forefront in the protest demonstrations which means that they have understood the dangers of privatisation. They have joined the banks after a very tough competition. They deserve job security which will be affected if banks are privatised.

In between the freeloaders (guised in the veil of friendship) and the established business firm demanding your services, there is no denying that the come-up of a visual artist is arduous. It is only in the past few years that the industry has gained any real momentum locally. Nonetheless, the question remains:  This creates a dynamic of imbalance between the client and the creator – where the input of the artist is virtually lost. What begins as a pursuit of expressing oneself becomes a slippery slope towards compensating for commercial appeal at the expense of one's own vision. Inevitably, personal projects come to a halt, burnouts occur more frequently and art blocks are omnipresent. In addition, the guilt of feeling like a \"sell-out\" is a telltale to the artist's endeavour. Photographer and motion graphic artist Zunayed Noor, 18, reflects on the general attitude towards experimentation. \"The room for experimentation is nulled in the first place because of the standards set by everyone in the industry, which has become the norm. Clients often don't care about styles as long as you're taking pictures and meeting the criteria,\" he says. \"Even if you take your time with personal projects and lay the groundwork for your visual style, you might not be able to use it commercially due to clients not being flexible about these things.\" On the flip side, Zunayed has also had a client approach him for his distinct style of video editing and even implemented it in their content. These are, of course, exceptions. With little to no room for exploring the limits, the wide majority of creatives on the market end up with a portfolio lacking originality, riddled with bland commercial work. As a result, such portfolios will stand to represent a market clustered with low-quality technical skills. 17-year-old graphic designer Faisal Rahman laments that clients are unwilling to value what the artist has to contribute in the conversation. \"More often than not, they will blow over whatever my thought process for a specific design is and almost demean my input,\" he says. Faisal feels that such a one-sided approach emerges because of a corporate need to implement art and design into their brand, not because they want it. This creates room for conformity. Back in the day, one might have wandered into a print shop somewhere in Nilkhet and asked the computer guy to make a logo in minutes without sparing much thought or cash into it. It is, however, vital that creators learn to cope with feedback and bad clients. Negotiating, setting adequate prices, having a solid grasp of the trade are just a few skills required to make it in an oversaturated industry. While artists have their own set of responsibilities, employers and clients must make sure that an upcoming generation of rising talent is not depleted and have their passion burned out.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-2\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/feature/images/2021/04/08/text.jpg?itok=encjiDxd&amp;c=cc4b7c10bf30aa8300359362f2223082\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162932", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17826", "source": "scrapy"},

In most cases, we tend to brush off such attempts to breach our online privacy, because these things seem relatively harmless compared to the more pressing issues when it comes to women, such as the recent spike in gender-based violence. However, are such acts really that harmless? Women are harassed online in many ways, and unsolicited texts are just the tip of the iceberg, along with friend requests from unknown people. You must have come across revolting comments under pictures of female celebrities or of any woman that goes viral, most of which can be classified under hate speech. You most probably have heard stories of leaked private pictures, videos or information without consent – also known as doxxing – and the devastating toll it takes on the victims. \"I have been harassed online by men on many counts. Often, they were in the form of continuous pestering texts that start off nice, but get more degrading with time. Sometimes, their texts are accompanied by inappropriate pictures or videos,\" shares Fabiha Fairooz*, a freelance writer. \"Once, when I was in high school, a group of boys decided to bully my friends and I in a group chat,\" says Zareen Tasnim*, who is now completing her undergraduate degree abroad. \"They made very weak yet unacceptable attempts at insulting me, which had to do with my financial status, my dual nationality, my looks etc. They were even petty enough to make comments about me sending memes in that group chat.\" This is a serious problem which has only increased during the pandemic since we are forced to spend more time online than ever before. According to a recent report by  , 80 percent of the victims of cyberbullying in Bangladesh are adolescent girls and women in their early twenties. In another report by  , most victims of cyberbullying do not report to the police, hence the statistic does not take into account the cybercrimes that go unreported. The question arises, why don't people report cybercrimes? Anika Anjum Iftee, Head of Content Development and Marketing at WeMen View, a non-profit social welfare organisation which works to raise awareness against cyber harassment of women, thinks that such cases are generally taken less seriously than physical ones. \"It's because there are too many factors to consider. With the ongoing calling out culture, the conversation around things like unsolicited texts could be easily manipulated, which can make the main discourse rather confusing. Also, since how we behave on social media is an evolving process, there is still so much to define and to make laws on concretely. While all of that happens, a lot of us will be unfortunate enough to fall victim to online harassment.\" The fact that technology is evolving too fast for us to catch up on the expanding confines of online harassment rings very true. Almost every day, new strides are being made in technology with more opportunities for harassers to abuse them. In this dizzying mess, no wonder tech-savvy women are struggling to deal with a constant barrage of harassment, both big and small. \"I don't think there's much to do. In my experience of receiving unwanted texts, I find that confronting these men is very draining because most see no wrong in their actions and will continue to verbally abuse you or others,\" Fabiha adds. It is as clear as daylight that the toxic standards most men in this region have been brought up to contribute to their interactions online. The firm belief that they will get away with harassing women in both physical and virtual spaces unfortunately enables them to do so. In addition, the common yet unjust shaming of female victims further encourages these abusers to carry on, as Zareen and her friends had faced, \"This cyberbullying incident was reported to the school management, but they didn't fulfil their promises. Instead, they resorted to victim blaming by accusing us of isolating one of our classmates who egged those boys on, even though we weren't friends with her in the first place.\" For all kinds of abuse, for too long, women have been putting in all the work to rage against the injustice. In the case of cyber harassment, from tightening privacy settings to filing cases, women still carry the burden to take preventive measures. However, prevention is not the only cure, at least in this case. In order to see an end to harassment not limited to the digital realm, education comes first, as Anjum explains, \"Measures should be integrated into the way we socialise from an early stage. At WeMen View, we want to teach children how to respect other genders and expand to do workshops with parents too. Humility and kindness are very important in the process of learning how to behave. Children need to know about the obvious red flags because if we are not aware of the danger, we won't be ready to tackle it.\" In the end, it all comes down to getting acquainted with some very simple, basic concepts: consent and respecting one's personal space, and that these apply to everyone regardless of any parameter that you can think of. If we keep all these in mind, perhaps one day all the spheres we occupy, the virtual one included, can be safe for everyone. * \n 1. The Daily Star (December 10, 2020).  2.

Making the announcement at a press conference here,leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav trained his guns at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, questioning his \"silence\" on the legislations which \"hold out the spectre of reducing farmers to beggars\".   \"We are baffled by the chief ministers reluctance to state where he stands on the issue. Does he think the agitating farmers are justified in hitting the streets or does he share the BJPs position that they are committing a mistake?......it is hard to believe that Nitish Kumar has his roots in the socialist movement\", Yadav fumed. The former Deputy CM deplored the failure of the chief minister, as also Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to come out with \"even a tweet\" expressing sympathy for the agitating farmers many of whom have lost their lives staging demonstrations close to the national capital despite biting cold. Flaying the NDA government in Bihar for having scrapped APMCs over a decade ago, Yadav alleged \"this had reduced farmers to labourers. The central laws will convert them, like cultivators elsewhere, into beggars\".   Kumar's government had abolished Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act in 2006 and also ended the mandi (wholesale markets for agricultural produce) system. He claimed that while his RJD was in power and the state was ruled, first by his father Lalu Prasad and subsequently mother Rabri Devi, farmers were better off as they often sold their produce at prices higher than the MSP. Decrying the use of force on many occasions to quell the stir in and around Delhi, the RJD leader said \"it is for the first time in the country that the chants of 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan' have been jettisoned and jawans are being pitted against kisan (farmers).   \"It is tragic, since most of our armed forces personnel come from agricultural backgrounds\". He also alleged that protests were being suppressed in similar fashion by the government in the state and cited the example of a recent police circular which stated offensive social media posts would be treated as \"cyber crime\" to buttress his point. Yadav, whose promise of \"10 lakh government jobs\" is widely believed to have boosted prospect of the RJD as well as the five-party opposition coalition in assembly polls,also slammed the state government for setting up committees to assess performance of 50 years plus employees with the supposed aim to retrench those who were not found up to the mark.   Representatives from other grand alliance constituents Congress, CPI, CPI(M) and CPI(ML) also spoke on the occasion.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162932", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16908", "source": "scrapy"},

The country is currently dealing with the coronavirus outbreak in the eastern parts. \r\n \r\n This resurgence has taken the lives of four people in the city of Mbandaka, the Health Minister Eteni Longondo said in a press conference. \"The National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) has confirmed to me that samples from Mbandaka tested positive for Ebola...

Mbandaka is the capital of Congo’s Equateur province, which serves as a transport hub alongside the Congo river and houses over a million people. Ebola had hit the same province in the summer months of May and July in 2018, which claimed the lives of 33 people. Since surfacing, the Ebola epidemic has killed 2,280 people in the country’s eastern region. The government was planning to announce the country Ebola free on June 25, but with new cases resurfacing, the country has to continue fighting it. A similar situation had come up in April this year when the country was three days away from declaring itself free of Ebola. \"This is a province that has already experienced the disease. They know how to respond. They started the response at the local level yesterday (Sunday),\" Longondo said. If no cases are reported for 42 days in a row, the country would be able to declare itself free of ebola. This marks the eleventh outbreak in the country since 1976. Alongside ebola, the country is battling the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed over 72 and infected over 3,000 so far.                ", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/06/01/142732-untitled-design-2.jpg?itok=RB6URKa9\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162931", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21720", "source": "scrapy"},

Hundreds of thousands of people in the Arab world are turning to Clubhouse, the fast-growing audio chat app, to mock and vent against longtime rulers, debate sensitive issues from abortion to sexual harassment, or argue where to find the best and cheapest shawarma sandwich during an economic crisis. The discussions are endless as they are breathless. More than 970,000 people from the Middle East have downloaded the new platform since it launched outside the U.S. in January. It has offered space for in-person conversations in an age where direct contact is at the mercy of the pandemic and it’s brought together those at home and the many in exile or abroad. But mostly, it has offered a release for bottled-up frustration in a region where violent conflicts and autocrats have taken hold and where few, if any, avenues for change — or even for speaking out — seem tenable. “It is an open coffeehouse that pierces through what is forbidden by the political regimes in the region,” said Diana Moukalled, a Lebanese journalist who closely follows social platforms. “Clubhouse has made people go back to debating one another.” The Middle East accounts for 6.1 percent of the 15.9 million global downloads of Clubhouse, which launched in the United States a year ago. Saudi Arabia ranks no. 7 globally for the invitation-only downloads, with over 660,000, just after Thailand and before Italy, according to San Francisco-based mobile app analytics firm Sensor Tower. One reason for its popularity seems to be the no-holds-barred atmosphere, fueled by the liveliness of group conversation. Saudis organized rooms to discuss who could replace their aging king instead of his ambitious son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They argued with Egyptians over what they considered democracy and with Lebanese and Jordanians over their kingdom’s perceived meddling in their affairs. Other rooms tackle taboo topics ranging from atheism to homosexuality. A Saudi woman discussed whether abortions should be allowed in the kingdom, prompting a heated back and forth. The platform also became a place to exchange information, challenging the region’s largely state-dominated media. Minutes after reports of an attempted coup in Jordan last week, Jordanians inside and outside the country congregated in a room to share information on the confusing reports released and controlled by the government. Families of those arrested in the ensuing sweep shared their news. Some users defended King Abdullah while backers of the brother prince accused of the coup vowed to rally behind him. Previously unimaginable debates took place among parts of society who would otherwise shun or block each other on other social media. Opponents debated supporters of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group. Elsewhere, Lebanese railed against private banks they blame for their country’s economic meltdown — with bankers in the room. In another room, Iraqis — mainly exiles — criticized how their country’s many religious militias impacted their lives. The moderator, a woman from the southern Shiite city of Najaf now living in Europe, told how her conservative family tried to mold her into “being like them” and opposed sending her to universities where men and women mingle. She fended off one man who suggested she was exaggerating, telling him he hadn’t experienced what she did. The moderator went on and named figures from powerful Shiite militias and religious leaders, saying she’d seen how they flout the rules they set for others. In the free-flowing conversation, militia supporters frequently interrupted, sparking a torrent of expletives from the moderator and others until they were forced to leave. “They controlled the ground with their muscles,” the moderator said of the militias. “But social media need brains. This (space) is ours.” Among the hundreds of rooms discussing the war in Syria, some users decided to lighten the mood. Opposition activists organized a spoof interview with someone posing as President Bashar Assad. It drew laughs but also poignant reminders of how the 10-year conflict devastated the country. “I ran away from you and still you follow me to Clubhouse,” one exiled Syrian told the fake “Assad.” But concerns are mounting that the open space could quickly come under the same government surveillance or censorship as other social media. A decade ago, activists in the Arab Spring protests flocked to Twitter and Facebook, which offered a similar free space. Since then, authorities have come to use the sites to target and arrest critics and spread their own propaganda. Oman has already blocked the Clubhouse app. In Jordan, it is obstructed on certain mobile networks, while in the United Arab Emirates, users have described unexplainable glitches. Pro-government commentators have railed against Clubhouse in TV shows and newspapers, accusing it of helping terrorists plan attacks, spreading pornography or undermining religious and state figures. First, Clubhouse drew rights defenders and political activists. Then came the government backers. “This room has grown because Salman’s people are here to defend him,” shouted a participant in a room featuring opponents of the Saudi crown prince. A discussion of the release of imprisoned Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul’s devolved into panicked mayhem when a few participants threatened to expose attendees and report them to authorities. The chat soon cut off. Recordings surfaced online from Clubhouse conversations deemed offensive, such as about homosexuality becoming acceptable, fueling fears that pro-government Saudi users were keeping tabs on critics. One participant asked to leave a chat among Lebanese when it was discovered she was Israeli, in part because some users feared they could be prosecuted under Lebanese laws banning mixing with Israelis. Some fear security agents are secretly in the rooms. Most participants in the app, which remains exclusive to iPhone users, use real names and sometimes put detailed bios. But growing numbers use fake names. Without anonymity, Clubhouse disagreements could turn into violence in real life, said Ali Sibai, a consultant with Beirut-based digital rights group Social Media Exchange, SMEX. Clubhouse’s “vague” policies also raise concerns, he said. The company says it temporarily stores conversations for investigating abuses. But it doesn’t say for how long or who reviews the Arabic content, raising questions whether unknown third parties may be involved, endangering participants’ security, he said. Moukalled, editor of Daraj, an independent online media, said it would be no surprise if authorities impose surveillance on Clubhouse. But, she said, something else would come along. “So long as people don’t feel they are part of the decision-making process, they will find these platforms.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/rockcms/2021-04/918/210409-clubhouse-app-al-1201-3a94fb_4f2406532eabed7266e7b8828c7f4aa9aba2a8ea.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Clubhouse App\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162919", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "43867", "source": "scrapy"},

Genocide, the nations declared, was “condemned by the civilized world” and justified intervention in the affairs of sovereign states. Now, a small but growing number of world leaders including Pope Francis and French President Emmanuel Macron have begun citing an offense they say poses a similar threat to humanity and remains beyond the reach of international criminal law: ecocide, or widespread destruction of the environment. The pope describes ecocide as “the massive contamination of air, land and water,” or “any action capable of producing an ecological disaster,” and   it a sin for Roman Catholics. The Pontiff has also endorsed a campaign by environmental activists and legal scholars to make ecocide the fifth crime before the International Criminal Court in The Hague as a legal deterrent to the kinds of far-reaching environmental damage that are driving mass extinction, ecological collapse and climate change. The monumental step, which faces a long road of global debate, would mean political leaders and corporate executives could face charges and imprisonment for \"ecocidal\" acts. To make their case, advocates point to the Amazon, where fires raged out of control in 2019, and where the rainforest may now be so degraded   than it draws in. At the poles, human activity is thawing a frozen Arctic and destabilizing the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Across the globe, climate change is disrupting the reliable seasonal rhythms that have sustained human life for millennia, while hurricanes, floods and other climate-driven disasters have   in the last six months. Fossil fuel pollution has   annually in recent years, according to a study in Environmental Research, more than tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS combined. One in 4 mammals  . For amphibians, it’s 4 in 10. Damage to nature has become so extensive and widespread around the world that many environmentalists speak of ecocide to describe numerous environmentally devastated hot spots: The campaign to criminalize ecocide is now moving from the fringe of advocacy into global diplomacy, pushed by a growing recognition among advocates and many political leaders that climate change and environmental causes are tied inherently to human rights and social justice. The effort remains a long shot and is at least years from fruition, international and environmental law experts say. Advocates will have to navigate political tensions over whether national governments or the international community have ultimate control over natural resources. And they’ll likely face opposition from countries with high carbon emissions and deep ties to industrial development. The environmentalists must also figure out how criminal law would address climate change, which has been driven by practices like burning coal and gasoline that are not only legal, but central to the global economy. The campaign to make ecocide a crime, however, is about more than law. Jojo Mehta, who launched the Stop Ecocide campaign in 2017 with Polly Higgins, a Scottish lawyer who died in 2019, describes it as a moral and practical issue as well. “We use criminal law to draw moral lines,” Mehta said. “We say something’s not accepted, your murder is not acceptable. And so, simply putting mass damage and destruction of nature below that red line actually makes a huge difference, and it will make a difference to the people that are financing what is going on.” Scott W. Badenoch Jr., an American environmental lawyer who favors the criminalization of ecocide, used the term to describe the state, and fate, of the Earth. “Ecocide is now endemic all over the planet,” he said. “The structures of ecology that have held up living organisms on Earth, since time immemorial, are collapsing everywhere.” He added, “Ecocide is now, frankly, the process that we are living in on Earth.” The concept of ecocide was born of tragedy. Over a period of 10 years, the United States government sprayed   of powerful herbicides, including Agent Orange, across the countryside in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to expose enemy sanctuaries during the Vietnam War. The dioxin-laced chemicals defoliated verdant jungle and caused cancers, neurological disease and birth defects in people living nearby. While the number of victims is disputed,   there are more than 3 million. In 1970, Yale biologist Arthur Galston invoked the destruction to call on the world to outlaw what he called “ecocide.” More than 20 years later, the global community came together to form the International Criminal Court, which was formally established in 2002 under a treaty called the Rome Statute to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes when its member countries, which currently  , fail to do so themselves. Early drafts of the Rome Statute included the crime of environmental destruction,   after opposition from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, based on various concerns, including that it wasn’t precisely defined. Instead, it was relegated to a wartime offense that has never been enforced. As a result, international criminal law includes few guardrails to prevent peacetime environmental destruction. “There's a big gap and something needs to fill it,” said Badenoch, a visiting attorney at the Environmental Law Institute. “We currently cannot hold big corporations or big governments accountable for ecocide,” Badenoch added. “So, what do you do? We name and shame — that's all we've got.” Decades of oil extraction in Nigeria by subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell, for example, have   in parts of the country with benzene and other toxic pollutants, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Civil lawsuits have taken years to wind through European courts, and no laws were strong enough to prevent the damage from happening, though Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary was recently  . Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman,   that says many of the spills have come as a result of sabotage and theft, and that the company has been working with stakeholders to clean up the pollution identified by the U.N. Environment Program. The International Criminal Court's supranational authority would make an ecocide crime particularly powerful, said Kate Mackintosh, executive director of the Promise Institute for Human Rights at the University of California Los Angeles. An ecocide crime would require International Criminal Court members to enact their own national ecocide laws, and failure to enforce those laws would enable the international court to step in. While political leaders and warlords have been the usual targets of the court, an ecocide crime could place business executives on notice, too. “That could make a difference in corporate boardroom conversations,” Mackintosh said. Even the threat of being labeled an international criminal, she said, might deter destructive corporate behavior. “I mean, for PR, it doesn’t look good, does it?” Mackintosh said making ecocide a crime could help in weak states, where corporate polluters are sometimes more powerful than national governments. “The likelihood of any criminal prosecution taking place in that state is pretty low,” she said. “But with an international crime, that’s actually not a bar.” China, the United States, India and Russia — four of the world’s top polluters — are not members of the International Criminal Court, but if a corporation based in one of those countries were to operate within a member state, as many of them do, their executives could fall under the court’s jurisdiction. The push to criminalize ecocide remained on the periphery until December 2019, when Vanuatu and the Maldives, two island nations threatened by rising seas and climate change-driven extreme weather, recommended that the court consider amending its statute to “criminalize acts that amount to ecocide.” “Our legacy and our future are at stake,” Vanuatu’s ambassador to the European Union, John Licht,  , stressing a “common bond” that united all the world’s people. “Our lives are intertwined by the environment we live in.” Willy Missack, who has served as part of Vanuatu’s delegation to the United Nations climate negotiations, said diplomats from other countries expressed shock when “little tiny Vanuatu” — a remote archipelago of more than 80 islands in the South Pacific — said it wanted to take on global powers and the fossil fuel industry through the courts. But the fact that corporations can continue to profit from carbon emissions that are threatening his country’s future, Missack said, makes the legal case clear. “It is not right,” he said, “and this is where justice comes in.” After Vanuatu asked the International Criminal Court to consider criminalizing ecocide, Mehta’s Stop Ecocide Foundation independently convened a panel of international legal experts, including Mackintosh of UCLA, to draft a clear definition of ecocide. They plan to publish their definition in June, at which point they hope at least one of the court’s member nations will formally propose that the court adopt ecocide as the fifth international crime against peace. Mehta has said the definition would likely require   of environmental destruction related to practices like widespread logging, drilling, mining and deep-sea trawling. Richard J. Rogers, a British expert in international criminal law who is a partner at Global Diligence and a member of the drafting panel, said it may be relatively straightforward to criminalize certain acts, like destruction of a forest or waterway. But climate change poses a greater challenge: Not only is it difficult to connect polluters to specific harms, he said, but there’s also nothing illegal about extracting or burning fossil fuels. “The situation we're dealing with is that the carbon system, which has fueled our economies since the Industrial Revolution, has not only been lawful, but it's been encouraged,” Rogers said. Another point that the drafters will have to grapple with is whether the crime of ecocide should require prosecutors to prove that humans have been harmed. Mackintosh said that while this “human harm” threshold could prove appealing politically — the court's existing crimes all largely involve harm to humans — focusing ecocide only on the environment could make it easier for prosecutors to prove, especially when it comes to harms related to climate change, which are often incremental and indirect. If a nation agrees to introduce the ecocide proposal to the International Criminal Court for consideration, that is when even harder work will begin. Ratification is a multistep process that would require support from either two-thirds or seven-eighths of the court’s members, depending on the type of amendment introduced. (Vanuatu still supports the campaign, but Covid-19 and the country’s “limited resources for international diplomacy” have put its ecocide advocacy on hold, said Dreli Solomon, a spokesman for Vanuatu’s embassy in Brussels.) While no country has committed to formally proposing that the court adopt ecocide, the campaign is gaining traction, fueled by the youth-led climate movement and radical new groups like Extinction Rebellion. In December, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès asked International Criminal Court member states to   of adopting ecocide as a crime. A member of Belgium’s Parliament has also proposed a bill to criminalize ecocide. And French lawmakers are working on legislation to make ecocide an   punishable by fines and prison, though Stop Ecocide   as “weak.” At least 10 countries have national ecocide laws already, including Vietnam, which enacted the law in 1990. Separately, French lawyers in January filed a request on behalf of Amazonian indigenous groups asking the International Criminal Court to investigate Bolsonaro of Brazil for crimes against humanity. The appeal alleges that deforestation encouraged by Bolsonaro’s government and other policies have forced indigenous people from their homes and even led to murders in the region. While the request relies on citations of crimes the court already addresses, the lawyers who submitted it     the case is also an example of ecocide. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said in a statement that \"the Bolsonaro administration is taking concrete action to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples and ensure the future of the Amazon.\" The embassy said that over 70 percent of the eligible Indigenous population has received initial Covid-19 vaccinations and that deforestation rates in the Amazon were 21 percent lower from August to January , compared to the same period a year earlier. Badenoch said that while the hurdles to adopting a new international crime are high, they are not insurmountable. “These things take a long time and they are complex,” he said. “But they can be done.” While the campaign for an ecocide law could take years — if it is successful at all — advocates say the effort could bear fruit much sooner: The ecocide campaign has thrust the concept into public discussion. Mehta doesn’t expect the campaign to catch fire in the United States, but after four years of President Donald Trump, she’s heartened by the arrival of John Kerry, Biden’s special climate envoy. “We don’t expect the U.S. to join the ICC any time soon, but that said, the conversation around ecocide itself, we don’t see any reason why it can’t start happening in the U.S.,” she said. The State Department released a statement saying that the U.S. “regularly engages with other countries” on “the importance of preventing environmental destruction during armed conflict,” but added, “We do not comment on the details of our communications with foreign governments.” Mehta’s campaign is also part of a wider effort by activists who have been looking to the courts to force more aggressive action on climate change. As of July 1, 2020, at least 1,550 climate change cases have been filed in 38 countries,  . In 2015, a Dutch court ruled in the Urgenda Climate Case that the government had acted negligently by failing to take aggressive enough action to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the ruling in   in 2019 and ordered the government to hit specific emissions reductions targets, sparking a series of similar lawsuits in other countries. In one of those lawsuits, a Paris administrative court  for failing to meet its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling relied, in part, on France’s nonbinding commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, taking what had been the soft pledge of politics and turning it into a legally binding commitment. Mehta has framed an ecocide law as a counterweight to the failings of the Paris Agreement, saying in   that it offers “a way to correct the shortcomings” of the global climate pact. “Whereas Paris lacks sufficient ambition, transparency and accountability, the criminalization of ecocide would be an enforceable deterrent.” Alex Whiting, a professor at Harvard Law School and former coordinator of prosecutions at the International Criminal Court, said that making ecocide a crime before the court would have tremendous impact, even if only a few cases were actually prosecuted. “When a crime becomes an international crime, it has a ripple effect,” he said. “The environment is the issue of our time. Being able to do something about that seems important.” In Vanuatu, though, there is a sense that the pace of climate change is beginning to outrun the country’s ability to adapt. Cyclones that have devastated the islands are expected to intensify as the globe continues to warm. Missack, the Vanuatu diplomat, said the effects of climate change run much deeper than damage from storms. Most of the country’s residents depend on the crops they grow and the fish they catch, so their lives are intertwined with the environment around them. Recently, the harvest of yam, a key crop that is  , was disrupted, throwing it out of alignment with the seasonal and celestial markers and accompanying rituals that normally tell farmers when to reap. “One day we will talk about the stars, and this is how the ritual goes. But it will never be the same spirit, the same soul of the ritual,” Missack said. “And that loss, none of the money in this world can pay for it.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_13/3461066/210331-ecocides-main-cover-cs_2ebc05549a4dd05c1b18fcee33fee8aa.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Photo illustration of Deepwater Horizon, Amazon fires, city pollution, ocean oil spill and refinery exhaust.\" height=\"1250\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162937", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "65129", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.business-standard.com", "section": "", "sub_section": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinancials\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "article_url": "https://www.business-standard.com/rss/companies-101.rss", "title": "", "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162831", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "application/rss+xml", "language": "", "length": "7828", "source": "scrapy"},

The massive Ever Given, a Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, got stuck Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal. In the time since, authorities have been unable to remove the vessel and traffic through the canal — valued at over $9 billion a day — has been halted, further disrupting a global shipping network already strained by the coronavirus pandemic.   The Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magno, called in to help tugboats already there, reached the Red Sea near the city of Suez early Sunday, satellite data from MarineTraffic.com showed. The tugboats will nudge the 400-meter-long (quarter-mile-long) Ever Given as dredgers continue to vacuum up sand from underneath the vessel and mud caked to its port side, said Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which manages the Ever Given. Workers planned to make two attempts Sunday to free the vessel coinciding with high tides, a top pilot with the canal authority said. “Sunday is very critical,” the pilot said. “It will determine the next step, which highly likely involves at least the partial offloading of the vessel.”   Taking containers off the ship likely would add even more days to the canal’s closure, something authorities have been desperately trying to avoid. It also would require a crane and other equipment that have yet to arrive. The pilot spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as he wasn’t authorized to brief journalists. On Saturday, the head of the Suez Canal Authority told journalists that strong winds were “not the only cause” for the Ever Given running aground, appearing to push back against conflicting assessments offered by others. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei said an investigation was ongoing but did not rule out human or technical error.   Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement maintains that their “initial investigations rule out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding.” However, at least one initial report suggested a “blackout” struck the hulking vessel carrying some 20,000 containers at the time of the incident. Rabei said he remained hopeful that dredging could free the ship without having to resort to removing its cargo, but added that “we are in a difficult situation, it’s a bad incident.” Asked about when they expected to free the vessel and reopen the canal, he said: “I can’t say because I do not know.” Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the company that owns the vessel, said it was considering removing containers if other refloating efforts failed.   The Ever Given is wedged about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the canal’s Red Sea entrance near the city of Suez. A prolonged closure of the crucial waterway would cause delays in the global shipment chain. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures. About 10% of world trade flows through the canal. The closure could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Already,   amid concerns of delays of shipments arriving amid the blockage. As of early Sunday, over 320 ships waited to travel through the Suez, either to the Mediterranean or the Red Sea, according to canal services firm Leth Agencies. Dozens of others still listed their destination as the canal, though shippers increasingly appear to be avoiding the passage.   The world’s biggest shipping company, Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk, warned its customers that it would take anywhere from three to six days to clear the backlog of vessels at the canal. Already, the firm and its partners have 22 ships waiting there. “The current number (of) redirected Maersk and partner vessels is 14 and expected to rise as we assess the salvage efforts along with network capacity and fuel on our vessels currently en route to Suez,” the shipper said. Mediterranean Shipping Co., the world’s second-largest, said it already had rerouted at least 11 ships around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope to avoid the canal. It turned back two other ships and said it expected “some missed sailings as a result of this incident.”   “MSC expects this incident to have a very significant impact on the movement of containerized goods, disrupting supply chains beyond the existing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,” it said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162937", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18012", "source": "scrapy"},

I’m 23 weeks pregnant, and my world has just been shattered. They call on us and escort us back to a waiting suite just for us. This might be the hardest day of our lives, but at least we’ll get to cry in peace. I see a plaque next to the window that overlooks the city. “The Window of Hope” was donated by a family that is now welcoming us into a club that we want nothing to do with.  I’m called to my first appointment of the day, an MRI of my abdomen that will take about an hour. Because of the pandemic, I’ll have to go alone. I’m in a giant metal tube that sounds like a construction site. A movie is on in the background to distract from the noise of the machine. It’s a movie I’ve seen many times, but it feels completely foreign and I just stare.  The tech gently tells me, “this next image we’ll need to take with you staying completely still.”  “Ok.” I think I say it out loud, but I’m not sure.  A recorded voice plays, “take a deep breath in ... now out ... now hold ...” and I do. I am a statue ― no breathing, no moving. I think maybe if I’m still enough, they’ll be able to see the part of my baby’s brain that they say is missing. Maybe if I’m still enough, they’ll run in and say, “We were wrong! Everything is fine! Finish planning your baby shower!” But they don’t. The rest of the day is littered with cameras and wires and dark rooms with bright screens. It’s invasive and uncomfortable and there’s an unspoken tension in the air. Something’s wrong, but we have to wait for the big reveal at the end of the day to find out exactly how wrong it is. We put on a movie in our waiting room and I fall asleep.  Then, it’s showtime. We walk slowly to a socially distanced conference room. A team of very smart doctors and specialists — thankfully, all of them women — explain what they know and predict what they can.  I hear snippets of what they say, phrases like: “Structure of the brain is missing” “Fluid in the ventricles”  “More than one anomaly can mean genetic disorder” “Lifelong impairment” “70% chance of this ... 45% chance of this ...” “There’s just no way to know...”  I oscillate between sobs and asking questions and then sit in silence waiting for them to tell me what to do ... until I realize that they aren’t going to. Seeing the anguish and confusion on our faces, one of the doctors asks if we want to chat alone. She explains the process of termination and what we can expect. Then she gives me the advice that makes it OK to move forward. She says, “Think about it, go over it, talk about it and make a decision. Once you’ve made the decision and it’s final, then don’t go back. Don’t try to renegotiate the past. Decide and never look back.” So we did.  The next day, we’re in a different hospital. It’s hard to navigate and far too crowded for a pandemic. We stand in a taped circle on the floor. Someone asks if I would like to take their seat and smiles at my pregnant belly. I start crying.  We’re called back to a tiny room and I lie down on the table just like it’s another sonogram. A doctor and his assistant can’t seem to look me in the face, or maybe that’s just how it feels. We are all deeply reverent of the grim reality of what’s about to take place. I see a giant needle and bury my face into my husband’s chest and we cry. And just like that, it’s done. His heart stops instantly.  That was the saddest moment of my life ― I can pinpoint it and still feel it. I can see what I was wearing and hear the machines beeping. It feels like part of me never left that room.  It took two days in the hospital to deliver. The doctors and nurses were incredible. I will never forget the understanding and compassionate care I received from those amazing humans. Every day we live with the decision we made, one that was reached only after experiencing unimaginable grief and making desperate phone calls, research and consulting with experts, and crying with our parents. In the end, I thought about what I would choose if it were me and I can confidently say that I would not choose a life of suffering for myself, so I would not willingly inflict it on someone else. I have no regret and would make the same decision if I had to do it over.   And, while my story is harrowing, I feel it’s important to point out that  . Yes, my choice was devastating, but at least there was a pretty clear path forward for me. The same cannot be said for many other women who are considering an abortion. Often, their decision is complicated by factors outside of their control. I was very lucky to be living in a state where the abortion laws work to empower women instead of seeking to deceive, deflect and deprive. Many women do not. But abortions don’t stop when access is restricted, and with fewer providers comes longer waits, which force women to continue with a pregnancy they are trying to end as early as possible.  In some states, a woman must have an invasive transvaginal ultrasound, then wait days before she can obtain an abortion, increasing the risk to her health.   to eventually ban abortion with no exceptions for incest, rape, or even if the mother’s life is in danger. Politicians in   and   have attempted to enact laws making the act of obtaining an abortion punishable by death. These measures aren’t pro-life, they are anti-woman. It’s not about saving life ― it’s about control.  In the end, it was my choice. It was a decision made between me and my husband and my doctors, and if anyone not personally involved thinks they or a politician on a moral soapbox deserves a place in the conversation, they are profoundly mistaken. If anyone thinks it is easy or fun to make this kind of unthinkable decision or that it’s made hastily, they are wrong. Still, regardless of why someone goes through what I just went through ― even if it’s for a reason that we do not understand or agree with — they should have the choice. They should have the right.", "image_url": "<img class=\"image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6064e379270000cf32c84d4f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" alt=\"The author and her husband are still navigating the tangle of emotions, but they were able to dig this frame out of a box and\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162927", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "61630", "source": "scrapy"},

Children were among those killed on Saturday, Myanmar’s Armed Forces Day, according to news reports and witnesses, in a crackdown that drew renewed Western criticism. The UN investigator said the army was carrying out “mass murder”.   “We salute our heroes who sacrificed lives during this revolution and We Must Win This REVOLUTION,” one of the main protest groups, the General Strike Committee of Nationalities (GSCN), posted on Facebook. Saturday also brought some of the heaviest fighting since the coup between the army and the ethnic armed groups that control swathes of the country. Military jets had killed at least three people in a raid on a village controlled by an armed group from the Karen minority, a civil society group said on Sunday, after the Karen National Union faction earlier said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border, killing 10 people. The airstrikes sent villagers fleeing into the jungle.   A junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment on the killings or the fighting. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta leader, had said during a parade to mark Armed Forces Day that the military would protect the people and strive for democracy. Myanmar Now news portal said 114 people were killed across the country in crackdowns on the protests. The dead included 40 people, one of them a 13-year-old girl, in Myanmar’s second city of Mandalay. At least 27 people were killed in the commercial hub Yangon, Myanmar Now said. Another 13-year-old was among the dead in the central Sagaing region. Deaths were recorded from the Kachin region in the mountainous north to Taninthartharyi in the far south on the Andaman Sea - taking the overall number of civilians reported killed since the coup to more than 440.   ‘THIS BLOODSHED IS HORRIFYING’ U.S. Ambassador Thomas Vajda said on social media: “This bloodshed is horrifying,” adding “Myanmar’s people have spoken clearly: they do not want to live under military rule”. The EU delegation to Myanmar said Saturday would “forever stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour.” The top military officer from the United States and nearly a dozen of his counterparts joined to condemn the killings by Myanmar’s army. Their statement said that a professional military must follow international standards for conduct “and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves.”   UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said it was time for the world to take action - if not through the UN Security Council then through an international emergency summit. He said the junta should be cut off from funding, such as oil and gas revenues, and from access to weapons. “Words of condemnation or concern are frankly ringing hollow to the people of Myanmar while the military junta commits mass murder against them,” he said in a statement. “The people of Myanmar need the world’s support. Words are not enough. It is past time for robust, coordinated action.” Despite the Western condemnation, Myanmar’s junta has friends elsewhere.   Russia’s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin attended Saturday’s military parade in Naypyitaw, having met senior junta leaders a day earlier. Diplomats said eight countries - Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand - sent representatives, but Russia was the only one to send a minister to the parade on Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of the resistance to Japanese occupation in 1945. Support from Russia and China, which has also refrained from criticism, is important for the junta as those two countries are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and can block potential U.N. actions.   The military has said it took power because November elections won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the country’s election commission. Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her party are also in custody. Myanmar’s embassy in London, which is under the control of junta opponents, said on Facebook that the ambassador met Suu Kyi’s son there on Thursday. Kim Aris had asked if the embassy could arrange a call with his mother, it said. “Kim asked about his mother’s situation, and her health. He is obviously extremely worried,” it said, adding that the ambassador had already sent three requests to Myanmar’s capital and would send another reminder.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162938", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17893", "source": "scrapy"},

Voters were seen standing in long queues braving the sweltering heat at several polling stations to cast their vote. In Nellore district, a BJP supporter dumped a ballot box in a water tub at Ponugodu village of Anuma Samudram Peta mandal falling under Atmakur assembly segment following a row with the ruling party agents over helping the aged people to reach polling station to cast their votes.   District collector KVN Chakradhar Babu announced the repoll in the village on Friday. Tellagunta villagers of Bogole mandal boycotted the polling to express their protest over not providing drinking water facilities in the village. In Prakasam district, the car of Darsi MLA Maddisetty Venugopal’s brother Ravindra was damaged as he went to Sivaramapuram village in Tallur mandal to see the polling trend. In West Godavari, a voter identified as Seshadri Venkata Durga Prasad was arrested by the Undi police as he tried to pour ink on ballot papers at the 32nd polling station in the village.   In East Godavari, polling was stopped for some time at a polling station located Sakurru village in Amalapuram as the ‘Glass’ symbol of Jana Sena party was not printed on the ballot paper. The problem was rectified and the polling was continued. A retired woman teacher Nrisimhadevara Simhachalam died while waiting for an auto-rickshaw to reach a polling station to cast her vote at Katrenikona. Police booked a case against a voter Kasi Venkata Ramana for taking a selfie with the ballot paper at a polling station at Pallamkurru village in Katrenikona mandal. The election authorities declared his vote as invalid.   In Vizianagaram district, polling was stopped in three stations in Anti Peta polling centre in Seethanagaram mandal as the voters found the name of YSR Congress dummy nominee Senapati Lakshmi in the ballot paper for MPTC polls though the official nominee was Senapati Nirmala. A repoll is likely to be held on Friday. Several adivasis in Visakhapatnam and other places faced a tough time to reach the polling stations for want of proper road connectivity. Hundreds of them crossed Matyasagedda in Arasu mandal to reach the polling stations. In Kurnool, two groups of voters entered into heated arguments at Devanakonda as some of them tried to resort to cross-voting.

There are no clear answers but top scientists say the complex interplay of mutant strains, a hugely susceptible population made more vulnerable by elections and other public events and the lowering of guard are primarily to blame. India's COVID tally has climbed to 1,33,58,805 (1.33 crore, 13.3 million) with a record spike of 1,52,879 daily cases, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday, in what many say is a second wave that is surging more powerfully than the first. As Delhi alone reported 10,732 fresh cases, far exceeding its earlier peak of 8,593 on 11 November, 2020, the number of active cases in the country breached the 11 lakh mark for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic. And just like there were no answers to why there was a slide earlier this year, there is no clarity on why the numbers are rising so sharply. While there are many imponderables and many things unknown, virologists Shahid Jameel and T Jacob John are agreed that not following   protocol, including informing people they must continue with precautions even after being vaccinated, and a sluggish vaccination drive are responsible. Jameel said the interplay of mutants and vaccines over the next couple of months will decide the future of Covid in India and the world. The intensity of the surge also suggests that there were ahuge number of susceptible people after the first wave, the director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University in Haryana told  . The Centre warned earlier this week that the next four weeks are critical and people's participation in helping control the second wave of the contagion is pivotal. NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said the pandemic situation has worsened with a sharp rise in cases and a large part of the population still susceptible to the virus, without giving any clear explanation on why this is happening. The fact that people lowered the guard and didn't follow Covid protocols after the first wave was over is certainly one valid explanation for the surge, Jameel said. Everything opening up to pre-Covid levels and behaviour that was no longer risk-averse exposed the susceptible population in a big way. A new factor is emerging mutants — both imported and homegrown, the eminent virologist added. John, professor of virology at Tamil Nadu's Christian Medical College (CMC), concurred with Jameel, saying not following   protocols is partly to blame for the new wave. Lowering of the guard was led by the central government and followed by all political parties, all religious groups, and the public at large. Schools and colleges were opened without vaccinating all staff. This explains partlythe second wave, John told  . Wherever infection was rising, stricter imposition of discipline should have been taken but with the elections ahead, no leader wanted that. Elections during pandemic had to be carefully planned, the renowned virologist told  . The scientist also agreed that variants are the other reason for the second wave, adding that it was too late for India to look for mutants. The two factors came together and we were leaderless in response at the critical time. The speed of spread in the second wave is twice as fast as in the first wave. Partly due to variants and partly lowering of the guard, John explained. Referring to a Health Ministry briefing on March 24, Jameel noted that the UK variants now show up in about 80 percent of cases from Punjab. A new double mutant has emerged in India and is reported in 15-20 percent of cases analysed from Maharashtra. If this percentage goes up further, it would be a clear indication of its role in the Maharashtra surge, said the virologist. In India, variants first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been found. In late March, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced that a new variant had been identified insamples of saliva taken from people in Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab. The genome sequencing carried out by Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a consortium of 10 labs in India, identified two important mutations in the variant dubbed as double mutant. Explaining that the UK variant is known to be about 50 percent more infectious, Jameel said one of the two mutations in the double mutant was also found in California, US, where it was associated with increased transmission. The two experts also discussed the country's vaccination drive. According to John, the government started the drive too lateand no outcome goal of vaccination was defined. India started slow vaccine rollout in January third week, but it was first a token reward to healthcare workers who were vaccinated even when there was no need -- and we wasted a lot of vaccines, he said. Was advance purchase order given to vaccine companies to get production accelerated during last year itself before approvals were obtained? John asked. Jameel said there was poor communication by officials to people who were vaccinated on how they must continue with precautions like masks and social distancing. Describing India's   situation as curious, Jameel said the country was on a falling curve of daily infections when vaccinations started in mid-January. For various reasons, those eligible, including healthcare and frontline workers, were hesitant to get vaccines. Those above 60 also did not show enough eagerness even though cases had started going up by early March. Now we are on a very fast rising curve with only 0.7 percent Indians having received both doses and only about 5 percent having received one dose. That is too low to make an impact, he added. He noted that there was no way to predict that younger people would be affected in this surge. Make everyone above 18 eligible for vaccination in states experiencing the surge, while staying with the 45 plus eligibility in states not experiencing the surge. Vaccinations have to be balanced against the supply of vaccines, Jameel said. Noting that supply may be an issue, Jameel said India has the capacity to inoculate with 10 million doses of Covishield vaccine per month and three million Covaxin doses per month. Supply can also be boosted by giving emergency use approval to Johnson & Johnson vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.

I decided that we were going to read Dr. Seuss’ “And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street.” I cradled the book in my hands, feeling very much like I was palming explosive contraband. The kids settled in on either side of me. My youngest, my sensitive 9-year-old son, snuggled close to my chest. My 15-year-old daughter raised her eyebrows as she looked down at my choice of books. She was aware of the announcement from the Dr. Seuss Foundation that it would be effectively “canceling” six of the author’s books due to their racist imagery.  “Sit down,” I said, patting the cushion beside me.  She did so wearily, crossing her arms. She was used to family nights where we would either play a board game, watch a movie or read a book, but she was apprehensive about this book.  “Don’t worry, I’ll explain,” I told her.  Finally, she melted and leaned her head against my shoulder. The gesture said, “I trust you, Mom.” I started to read the book and every few pages I stopped so we could discuss what we were seeing. “What’s this?” I asked them, pointing to a wildly stereotypical caricature of an Asian character.  “It’s racism,” my daughter quipped.  My son looked up at me, moony-eyed and confused.  “I don’t get it,” he said. The comment encouraged a conversation about harmful Asian stereotypes. We talked about misrepresentation, ethnocentrism and underrepresentation. After reading “And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street,” we read Belle Yang’s book “Hannah is My Name,” a beautiful story about a young Taiwanese girl who immigrated to the United States. We examined the differences between the two stories ― the farcical treatment of the Asian characters in Seuss’ book versus the empowerment and voice given to Yang’s protagonist.  I explained that the latter comes from the fact that Yang herself is a Taiwanese woman and how this lends authenticity to her text that is sorely missing in Seuss’ books. Without this comparison, my children would have never known how a marginalized author’s voice can change the narrative and also help to subvert harmful stereotypes.  I believe as parents it is irresponsible to avoid children’s books that include racist ideology. Racism doesn’t disappear because we shut our eyes and pretend it doesn’t exist. We must arm our children with the tools to spot it ― and then fight it.  This is a hard truth I have had to grapple with as I silently watched each one of my childhood treasures receive the ax of condemnation. While I struggled with the pain of the denouncement of such books as “The Jungle Book,” “Peter Pan,” and ”The Little House on the Prairie,” I also found myself experiencing an awakening. I remember this moment vividly. I remember running to my desk and sitting down to write a list of my favorite childhood books. As my list grew longer, I noticed a pattern: There was an absence of any characters that looked or spoke like me. To be honest, there is an impenetrable wave of whiteness that engulfs these novels and a simultaneous silencing of othered voices. Because of this, when I was in high school, it wasn’t strange to me when “To Kill a Mockingbird”’s Atticus Finch swooped in to save the downtrodden Tom. It was what was normal to me. All of my literary heroes were white, and the people of color in books were woefully one-dimensional and easily forgettable cardboard figures. Later on, I didn’t bat an eyelash while reading about Huckleberry Finn sliding down the Mississippi River with his dehumanized Black companion Jim. To me, reading these books confirmed an essential truth about myself that I had been taught and then resigned myself to: I was Black, and I would never be the hero. Now, as a mom and an educator, I look at these books with a discerning eye.  When I read the books with my children, we immediately discuss the book’s time period, the author’s intent and the harmful depictions of marginalized people. For my students, the majority of whom are white, I find it equally important to apply these same concepts.  Huckleberry Finn, a staple in our 11th grade English curriculum, has been on the banned book list for many years, but I contend that this is an important text to teach. Although Twain uses the n-word 219 times in Huckleberry Finn, there is a method to the madness. Removing the word desensitizes the horrific nature of the time period. It delegitimizes Jim’s struggle. Removing the book from the curriculum altogether serves as an erasure of history. It doesn’t just erase Mark Twain’s words, it erases Jim ― the echo of the lived experience of so many American slaves. Instead, I believe it’s better to give students the tools to dissect and critically explore these types of books in order to ensure a healthy discourse. Furthermore, it is important to realize these texts are not vehicles of complete evil and that we can’t just throw the baby out with the bathwater. It is more nuanced than that. After all, there is a reason Jim, an uneducated slave, is the pinnacle of morality in the Huck Finn text.  ", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162938", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "61039", "source": "scrapy"},

I know this because I work at a fine-dining restaurant in a ritzy ski town and it’s my job to provide a luxurious dining experience for the guests who walk through our door. As millions of people have hunkered down in their apartments, eating frozen pizza, binge-watching   and trying not to think about how or if they’ll be able to afford next month’s rent, our wealthy restaurant guests have been enjoying $500 bottles of wine, lounging at tables for three hours or more, and generally acting like the virus doesn’t exist. I admit that I profit from their behavior. I am able to pay for health insurance and food and lodging because of the people who can afford to dine at the restaurant where I work. As much as that fact bothers me, I am also grateful to make a living and to catch a glimpse of these alien lifestyles during what has proved to be one of the most challenging moments in recent history. “You know, I just don’t like the ambience in here,” a middle-aged woman weighed down by her diamonds told me one night as I showed her to her table. It was late July in our little mountain town and I had assigned this guest a spot in our outdoor tent — our effort at safer and more comfortable seating after a limited capacity law had reduced our small restaurant’s indoor dining to only five tables. Because it is my job to please our patrons, I swallowed my snarky response and brought her back inside, where I offered her a table in the corner that would soon be free. “Hmmm, could you maybe just add another table in the center of the dining room? The lighting is much nicer there,” she asked me. When I explained to her that, due to the pandemic raging around the world, we were required to keep diners 6 feet apart and, so, there was no room for an additional table, she conferred with her husband and then responded, “It’s just that we own hotels all over the world and had higher expectations.” And then they walked out the door. Since I have worked in restaurants in this resort town for nearly two years, I am no stranger to the entitled behavior that some of our VIP guests flaunt. Even before COVID struck, many of them were pushy and rude when making their inane requests, convinced that they were above reproach or certain that rules ― and even the law ― did not apply to them simply because of their financial status. I would venture a guess that most of these difficult people have never worked in customer service because if they had, they wouldn’t treat us the way they do. Many of them barely make eye contact as they toss their demands at us. Some have mentioned their celebrity friends in the hopes of getting preferential treatment or made requests like “best table in the house!” on their online reservations and then express scathing disappointment if their outlandish desires aren’t fulfilled. One customer threatened to get me fired because the drinks I made him weren’t “strong enough” and he was friends with the ski resort owner. Other guests refused to take their vaping outside when I asked and cited “spending quite a lot of money here” to justify their illegal activity. A few times during the past year, I was hired to work private dining events in some of this town’s grandest mansions. At one home, a sign by the door instructed me to take my shoes off and I wandered the large open hallways in my socks with trays of food, seeking out the guests in the hosts’ game room, full bar, sitting room, or one of three decks, each of which was twice as large as my pricey studio apartment. While the hosts were friendly enough, they made no attempt to wear a mask when they came near me or other hired staff and didn’t seem to think it was problematic to throw a large dinner party when in-person meetups were being restricted in our town and around the world. Once they were seated, I was forced to listen to them talk about their recent travel to COVID hot spots like Florida and Texas for business or to renovate their multiple homes, all the while worrying that because of their careless behavior I was being exposed to the virus.  This past year, as COVID regulations were put in place and then changed every few weeks, I was tasked with enforcing these rules in order to keep our staff and diners safe. So, instead of concentrating on providing our guests with the best possible service, I’ve been forced to come up with creative ways to satisfy their needs while also abiding by state laws. The high demands of some of our entitled patrons, coupled with these new rules designed to lessen the potentially deadly risks of dining out, made for some tricky interactions in the restaurant.  Many guests have seemed unable to accept the refusal of service they feel they deserve, even when it is the county law that restricts their experience. There was the man whose wife was cold while dining outside in her fur coat, so he asked how much he could pay me to sneak them inside, even though he knew it was illegal to be seated indoors at that time. There were the folks who were outraged when I explained I could only accommodate a party of 10 or fewer guests due to the town’s pandemic guidelines. And there were the people who left a terrible tip because we refused to serve them a fourth round of cocktails after the county-appointed last call of 8 p.m.  Many of my interactions with the wealthy during the last year have revealed just how ignorant these people are about the harsh reality of living through a pandemic that the rest of us are facing. One night, a table of diners reeled me in to lament about how they’d been stuck in their house in Switzerland when lockdown first hit. When they were allowed to leave the country, they had to deal with splitting their time between their homes in New York City and Houston before they could  escape to the mountains. Meanwhile, my co-workers and I have been taking extra time to frequently wash our hands and sanitize the bathrooms and other high-touch surfaces ― not to mention reminding guests to wear their masks when walking through the restaurant ― all while continuing to provide excellent service. We’ve had to stay informed about and then follow the new regulations the county disseminates every few weeks ― going from busy dinner service to just takeout and then running around in bitterly cold temperatures when outdoor dining was the only option. When we reopened after being furloughed for several months, the threat of shutting down again and having no income at all always loomed behind every new restriction.  On top of all this, we’ve spent the last year fearing that any of the maskless guests we’re serving might infect us with COVID, thereby forcing us out of work for a couple of weeks (or more), sending us or someone we love to the hospital, or worse. I have a preexisting condition that puts me at high risk for complications if I contract the virus, and early in the pandemic I was forced to make the tough choice between staying home to protect my health and not making any money or putting myself at risk in order to pay my rent and afford a doctor appointment if I were to catch the virus. As a former boss once told me, people go to restaurants to get an experience they can’t create at home. Since many people’s home lives have been less than pleasurable lately, I understand how special it is to be waited on and to eat something you would never cook for yourself. Still, I believe that should make us all the more grateful when we do get to go out. We should savor every moment of an event that was once commonplace and is now precious. Instead, many of our wealthy guests seem to assume that their financial status places them beyond the realm of pandemic restrictions. I pity them for that. The reality is, as many have learned this past year, there are certain kinds of suffering that no stack of hundred dollar bills can fix. Sometimes, it’s my job to make that reality clear. Our entitled patrons are visibly frustrated that their money cannot manipulate the system in their favor and I recognize in them the very human pain of being unable to control their circumstances. Still, I’m happy to report that not everyone has been so demanding. Our restaurant was able to stay open and adapt to COVID protocols thanks to people who have donated to the town’s restaurant assistance funds. And there are guests who have been absolutely wonderful. Like the ones who leave incredibly generous tips ― sometimes over $1,000. Or the gentleman who called to tell us he couldn’t make his reservation the next night but insisted on tipping the staff anyway. Or the guests who simply put on their masks when we approach their table and ask us how we’re holding up with genuine interest and concern. There are the guests who thank us profusely for staying open and allowing them an enjoyable night out ― who seem to recognize how privileged they are to drink wine and eat caviar during a pandemic. They treat us well because we are giving them that opportunity and that goes a long way.  No matter how much or how little we have, I’d like to think this pandemic might teach us all something about humility, that we might be humbled by the unpredictable way this virus has shaken our lives. There will always be those who think that being rich places them above the rules, and I feel truly sorry for them. How tough must life be if you can get so disappointed by “ambience” or the strength of your drink? In the wake of the pandemic and these experiences, I’ve decided to take some time off and try to find a career that isn’t dictated by the desires of the wealthy. While some of the behavior I’ve seen has disheartened me, I’m choosing instead to focus on the generosity and empathy I’ve witnessed some of our other guests offer. They’ve inspired me to make my own much smaller acts of giving when I can. Maybe that will set off a kind of trickle-down kindness. Maybe not. Regardless, I’m thankful to have had a job during the pandemic ― I know many people did and still do not. No matter what has happened or happens going forward, I’m grateful for the beautiful sense of community I’ve seen fostered among so many different kinds of people, all of whom seem to recognize that we’re all going through something difficult together. May we keep that spirit alive long after the pandemic is gone.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162940", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "62322", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.foxnews.com", "section": "lifestyle", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/dominos-customer-point-gun-toppings-on-side", "title": "Domino's customer points gun at workers because he couldn't get toppings on the side: report", "author": "By", "author_link": "", "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "The suspect is also accused of throwing slices of pizza at the workers", "text": "toppings typically come on top of the pizza.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/04/931/524/iStock-1132863328.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1\" alt=\"Fox News Flash top headlines for April 11\" data-v-34380c3f>", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162928", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "16217", "source": "scrapy"},

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162938", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16252", "source": "scrapy"},

In between the freeloaders (guised in the veil of friendship) and the established business firm demanding your services, there is no denying that the come-up of a visual artist is arduous. It is only in the past few years that the industry has gained any real momentum locally. Nonetheless, the question remains:  This creates a dynamic of imbalance between the client and the creator – where the input of the artist is virtually lost. What begins as a pursuit of expressing oneself becomes a slippery slope towards compensating for commercial appeal at the expense of one's own vision. Inevitably, personal projects come to a halt, burnouts occur more frequently and art blocks are omnipresent. In addition, the guilt of feeling like a \"sell-out\" is a telltale to the artist's endeavour. Photographer and motion graphic artist Zunayed Noor, 18, reflects on the general attitude towards experimentation. \"The room for experimentation is nulled in the first place because of the standards set by everyone in the industry, which has become the norm. Clients often don't care about styles as long as you're taking pictures and meeting the criteria,\" he says. \"Even if you take your time with personal projects and lay the groundwork for your visual style, you might not be able to use it commercially due to clients not being flexible about these things.\" On the flip side, Zunayed has also had a client approach him for his distinct style of video editing and even implemented it in their content. These are, of course, exceptions. With little to no room for exploring the limits, the wide majority of creatives on the market end up with a portfolio lacking originality, riddled with bland commercial work. As a result, such portfolios will stand to represent a market clustered with low-quality technical skills. 17-year-old graphic designer Faisal Rahman laments that clients are unwilling to value what the artist has to contribute in the conversation. \"More often than not, they will blow over whatever my thought process for a specific design is and almost demean my input,\" he says. Faisal feels that such a one-sided approach emerges because of a corporate need to implement art and design into their brand, not because they want it. This creates room for conformity. Back in the day, one might have wandered into a print shop somewhere in Nilkhet and asked the computer guy to make a logo in minutes without sparing much thought or cash into it. It is, however, vital that creators learn to cope with feedback and bad clients. Negotiating, setting adequate prices, having a solid grasp of the trade are just a few skills required to make it in an oversaturated industry. While artists have their own set of responsibilities, employers and clients must make sure that an upcoming generation of rising talent is not depleted and have their passion burned out.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-2\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/feature/images/2021/04/08/text.jpg?itok=encjiDxd&amp;c=cc4b7c10bf30aa8300359362f2223082\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162938", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17826", "source": "scrapy"},

Myanmar military aircraft carried out three strikes overnight on Sunday into Monday, according to Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian relief agency that delivers medical and other assistance to villagers. The strikes possibly injured one person but caused no apparent fatalities, a member of the agency said.   Earlier Sunday, an estimated 3,000 people crossed the river dividing the two countries into Thailand's Mae Hong Son province following two days of aerial attacks. Video shot that day shows a group of villagers, including many young children, resting in a forest clearing inside Myanmar, having fled their homes. They carried their possessions in bundles and baskets. In Sunday's previous attacks, Myanmar military aircraft dropped bombs on a Karen guerrilla position in an area on the Salween River in Karen state's Mutraw district, according to workers for two humanitarian relief agencies. Two guerrillas were killed and many more were wounded in those attacks, said a member of the Free Burma Rangers.   On Saturday night, two Myanmar military planes twice bombed Deh Bu Noh village in Mutraw district, killing at least two villagers. The attacks may have been retaliation for the Karen National Liberation Army, which is fighting for greater autonomy for the Karen people, attacking and capturing a government military outpost on Saturday morning. According to Thoolei News, an online site that carries official information from the KNU, eight government soldiers including a second lieutenant were captured in the attack and 10 were killed, including a lieutenant colonel who was a deputy battalion commander. The report said one Karen guerrilla had been killed.   The tension at the frontier comes as the leaders of the resistance to last month's coup that toppled Myanmar's elected government are seeking to have the Karen and other ethnic groups band together and join them as allies, which would add an armed element to their struggle. The airstrikes mark an escalation in the increasingly violent crackdown by the Myanmar government against opponents of the February 1 military takeover. At least 114 people across the country were killed by security forces on Saturday alone, including several children a toll that has prompted a UN human rights expert to accuse the junta of committing mass murder and to criticise the international community for not doing enough to stop it.   The Security Council is likely to hold closed consultations on the escalating situation in Myanmar, UN diplomats said Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement. The council has condemned the violence and called for a restoration of democracy, but has not yet considered possible sanctions against the military, which would require support or an abstention by Myanmar's neighbour and friend China. The coup, which ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, reversed years of progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. It has again made Myanmar the focus of international scrutiny as security forces have repeatedly fired into crowds of protesters.   As of Sunday, at least 459 people have been killed since the takeover, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which has tallied deaths it was able to verify. The true toll is thought to be higher.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162938", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17409", "source": "scrapy"},

The congregation had been inside the church on the island of Sulawesi at the time of the explosion, police said, just as the mass was ending.   Local police had previously said the bomber had acted alone. Authorities were looking into which radical networks the bombers came from and whether the attack was linked to recent arrests of suspected militants, national police spokesman Argo Yuwono said. In January, a counter-terrorism unit raided a militant hideout in Makassar and killed two men suspected by police of involvement in twin bombings at a Philippine church in 2019 that killed more than 20 people. Father Wilhemus Tulak, a priest at the church, told Indonesian media that a suspected bomber tried to enter the church grounds on a motorbike, but had been stopped by a security guard.   Security camera footage showed a blast that blew flame, smoke and debris into the middle of the road. Police did not say who might be responsible for the attack and there was no immediate claim of responsibility. Police blamed the Islamic State-inspired Jamaah Ansharut Daulah group for suicide attacks in 2018 on churches and a police post in the city of Surabaya that killed over 30 people. Boy Rafli Amar, the head of the country’s National Counterterrorism Agency, described Sunday’s attack as an act of terrorism. Makassar Mayor Danny Pomanto said the blast could have caused far more casualties if it had taken place at the church’s main gate instead of a side entrance.   Makassar, Sulawesi’s biggest city, reflects the religious makeup of Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country with a substantial Christian minority and followers of other religions. “Whatever the motive is, this act isn’t justified by any religion because it harms not just one person but others, too,” Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, Indonesia’s religious affairs minister, said in a statement. Gomar Gultom, head of the Indonesian Council of Churches, described the attack as a “cruel incident” as Christians were celebrating Palm Sunday, and urged people to remain calm and trust the authorities. Indonesia’s deadliest Islamist militant attack took place on the tourist island of Bali in 2002, when bombers killed 202 people, most of them foreign tourists.   In subsequent years, security forces in Indonesia scored some major successes in tackling militancy, but more recently there has been a resurgence of militant violence.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162938", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16916", "source": "scrapy"},

Although diving for treasures is no longer a necessity for many, some traders are keeping the tradition alive. The history of pearl diving in the UAE goes back to more than 7,000 years ago. A time when UAE pearls travelled to Rome, Venice, Sri Lanka and even to India. United Arab emirate's pearls were one of the most sought-after accessories of the time. Abdullah al-Suwaidi recalls how his family's fortune depended on pearling much before the discovery of oil in the gulf. \"I lived and grew up around my grandfather, who lived off of pearl diving. He taught me a lot about pearl diving because of my continuous stream of questions and requests for more information and stories of adventure. It inspired my imagination.\", said Abdullah al Suwaidi, owner of a pearl farm. With UAE's petroleum exports reaching sixty-six point two billion dollars this year. Commercial pearl trading has become a dying tradition and Suwaidi's farm is the only commercial pearl farm in the United Arab Emirates. Abdullah al Suwaidi, also added that \"It is regrettable that nations that didn't even exist in 1906 (when it came to pearling) are now the biggest producers of pearls in the world, and the Gulf states, including the UAE, do not contribute (to the trade).\" Back in the hay days, pearl diving offered seasonally if not full-time work for many local Emiratis. Suwaidi managed to keep the tradition alive and still thrills curious tourists by demonstrating how his ancestors would pick oysters off the seabed. Legend has it that once the owner of luxury jewellery brand, Jaques Cartier had travelled to the gulf in pursuit of the world's most precious and exquisite pearls. With the advent of artificial pearls and the discovery of oil in the Arabian peninsula. UAE's pearl trade took a back seat but it still maintains it's cultural significance.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/11/28/118306-untitled-design-1.jpg?itok=9GRovf7K\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162937", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21290", "source": "scrapy"},

Le Van Hai, 54, had slandered local leaders and Communist Party members, prosecutors said, and was charged with “abusing freedom and democratic rights to infringe upon the interests of the state” under Article 33 of Vietnam’s 2015 Penal Code. Taken into custody in September 2020, Le had complained to Binh Dinh authorities and other government departments to ask for compensation payments because his family’s house and land had been confiscated to make way for construction of a wastewater plant, state media said. Frustrated by officials’ refusal of his requests, Le then shared his frustrations on Facebook, leading to his arrest. While all land in Vietnam is ultimately held by the state, land confiscations have become a flashpoint for protests as resident accuse the government of pushing small landholders aside in favor of lucrative real estate projects, and of paying too little in compensation to farming families displaced by development. Another Facebook user, Vu Tien Chi, was meanwhile sentenced Tuesday in a one-day trial the central highlands province of Lam Dong to a prison term of 10 years, with three years of probation to be served after his release, state media said. Vu, 55, was convicted under Article 117 of the 2015 Criminal Code for “defaming the people’s government and senior leaders of the Party” in 338 posted stories and 181 livestream videos calling for the establishment of a “National Congress” set up to replace the current National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Prosecutors said Vu’s postings had aimed at “creating conflicts and undermining the people’s trust” in their form of government. Also on March 30, a court in south-central Vietnam’s Khanh Hoa province brought to trial Nguyen Thi Cam Thuy, a former math teacher, and two other people—Ngo Thi Ha Phuong and Le Viet Hoa—on charges of “creating, storing, and disseminating information, materials and items opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.” Thuy, who was arrested on June 24, 2020, had burned the Vietnamese national flag and Communist Party flag, hanging the flag of the former South Vietnamese government in their place, in livestream broadcasts on social media, according to reports in the province’s Khanh Hoa newspaper. On Monday, Tran Thanh Phuong—a member of the opposition Hien Phap, or Constitution Group, serving a three-year prison term and suffering from asthma—reported to family members he had been transferred from a room for political prisoners to a crowded and cigarette smoke-filled criminal ward, his wife told RFA. Tran had been disciplined after trying to mediate a conflict between two other inmates, and was kept in handcuffs and leg irons in an isolation cell from March 2 to March 12, after which he was transferred to the criminal ward, Le Thinh Khanh said. “Since my husband was transferred to the new ward, he has had to work outdoors, and he asked prison officials to allow him not to work as he has high blood pressure and can’t stand working under the sun,” Le said. “But the officers then sent him to a room for patients suffering from various diseases, and being afraid of getting ill himself, he now wants to work outdoors again instead of staying in that room,” she said. The Hien Phap Group, a network of activists formed in 2017 to call for the rights to freedom of speech and assembly guaranteed by Vietnam’s own Constitution, had played a major role in calling for protests that rocked Vietnamese cities in June 2018 in opposition to a proposed cybersecurity law and a law granting concessions of land to Chinese businesses. Seven of its members are still in prison serving sentences of from five to eight years on charges of “disturbing security” under Article 118 of Vietnam’s Penal Code. In its   report, Washington D.C.-based Freedom House gave Vietnam an overall score of 19 out of a possible 100, a one-point drop from last year’s rating. Vietnam scored three out of 40 in political rights, and 16 out of 60 in civil liberties. ”Freedom of expression, religious freedom, and civil society activism are tightly restricted [and the] authorities have increasingly cracked down on citizens’ use of social media and the internet,” Freedom House said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162919", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12743", "source": "scrapy"},

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three children were among those killed after midnight Friday in the village of Bala in the jihadist-run Idlib region. \"A man, his wife, and their two little girls were among those killed,\" said the head of the Britain-based monitoring group, Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent at a hospital in the area saw the bodies of two of the children wrapped up in thick winter blankets. The strike created a massive crater of rubble near a two-storey home flanked by an empty outdoor swimming pool, the correspondent said. A rescue worker found a stuffed toy cockerel inside the building. Another first responder retrieved two slain rabbits.  The Observatory, which relies on sources inside Syria for its information, says it determines who carried out airstrikes according to flight patterns as well as aircraft and ammunition involved. The Idlib region has witnessed an uptick in violence this week, as the Syrian government presses a deadly offensive despite a ceasefire arranged by its Russian ally and rebel-backer Turkey. Home to three million people, the jihadist-run bastion is made up of a large part of the Idlib province, as well as slivers of the neighbouring Aleppo and Latakia provinces. Idlib is run by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group dominated by Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate. Fighting there since Wednesday has killed 28 civilians including eight children, according to the Observatory. It also took the lives of 58 pro-regime fighters and 67 fighters most of them jihadists, it added. Violence in recent weeks has prompted hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee their homes, exposing them to a harsh winter. On Thursday, Russia denied launching any combat operations in the region since the start of a ceasefire it said went into effect on January 9. According to Turkey, the truce started on Sunday. On Saturday, the Russian army deplored attacks led by HTS, describing them as \"deliberate acts\" designed to \"undermine the ceasefire\", according to Russian news agencies.

An apology was also issued by the French President once the delegation had concluded its visit to the church, they added; though spokespersons travelling with Macron declined to confirm or deny that statement. Israeli sovereignty over the Old City is not recognized by France as it lies in the eastern part of Jerusalem which the European nation of France regards as occupied territory. Though most of the world shares that characterization, it is disputed by Israel, which considers all of Jerusalem to be its sovereign territory.

For weeks, the Philippine government has engaged in a verbal tussle with Beijing and lodged diplomatic protests over the presence of dozens of Chinese ships in contested waters of the sea, but China has denied the allegations and said these are fishing vessels. “The U.S. admonition to China against the use of force on Philippine public vessels and aircraft, which are performing their constitutional mandate to protect and defend Philippine rights in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, is an additional affirmation of the long-standing partnership between our two countries,” said Arsenio Andolong, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of National Defense.  “As the situation in the West Philippine Sea evolves, we keep all our options open in managing the situation, including leveraging our partnerships with other nations such as the United States,” Andolong said, referring to the section of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines.  A day earlier, the U.S. State Department reiterated that Washington was backing its longtime Asian ally – a former American colony – in the ongoing dispute over the Chinese ships moored at Whitsun Reef, which lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and other disputed waters in the Spratly Islands. “As we have stated before, an armed attack against the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, will trigger our obligations under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty,” Ned Price, the department’s spokesman, told a daily press briefing in response to a reporter’s question. Under the auspices of the 70-year-old treaty, the armed forces of the United States and the Philippines will come to each other’s military aid in the event of an external attack on one of them.  Despite repeated calls by Manila for the ships to leave the area and the filing of diplomatic protests, the Chinese vessels have lingered there.  Last week, the Philippine military said dozens of Chinese militia ships were scattered among contested reefs and islets in the Philippine EEZ.  China’s foreign ministry has insisted the area around Whitsun Reef belongs to Beijing. “The Philippines attempts to use an illegal, null-and-void award to negate China’s sovereignty, rights and interests, negate Chinese fishermen’s fishing history and rights in their traditional fishing grounds,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a press briefing on Tuesday. “We hope the Philippines will look at this objectively and correctly, immediately stop wanton hype … and avoid casting negative influence on bilateral relations and the overall peace and stability in the South China Sea,” he said. The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond on Thursday to the Philippine and U.S. statements. Beijing insists much of the South China Sea is its territory, despite a July 2016 international arbitral ruling by a United Nations-backed tribunal that affirmed the Philippines’ EEZ. Other governments claiming parts of the South China Sea are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Although Indonesia does not consider itself a claimant in the territorial disputes, China claims historic rights that overlap with Indonesia’s EEZ.  Since Monday the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has filed daily protests against China about the ships in its EEZ. On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. again demanded that all the Chinese ships move out.  “Nobody fishes by lashing ships together. Last time that was done was the Persian invasion of Greece recorded by Herodotus,” Locsin said in a Twitter post late Wednesday. “We’ve seen that movie.” The Chinese presence in the Philippine EEZ also has Manila counting on its Visiting Forces Agreement with Washington, which President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to terminate. In February, Lloyd Austin, the defense chief in the new Biden Administration, reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to the 1999 VFA and the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty during his first official phone call with his Philippine counterpart, Delfin Lorenzana. The VFA, which allows the presence of U.S. troops in the Philippines, has remained in effect since Manila deferred its termination.  The pact is also the basis for another defense cooperation agreement, which allows U.S. troops to pre-position assets at certain Philippine military bases.  “We are continuously in talks with the U.S. on the matter of mutual defense,” Andolong said Thursday.  “Both parties are committed to undertake their obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty so that neither stands alone in these issues involving the two states’ inherent right of self-defense, individually and collectively,” he said.  The U.S., meanwhile, has maintained naval patrols in the South China Sea. On Sunday, the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group entered the waterway to carry out maritime strike exercises, anti-submarine operations, coordinated tactical training, and other activities, according to the U.S. Navy.  On Wednesday, the Royal Malaysian Air Force announced it had completed a two-day bilateral military exercise in the sea with the Roosevelt strike group.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"210408-PH-CH-US-defense-inside.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/philippine/210408-ph-ch-us-defense-inside.jpg\" title=\"210408-PH-CH-US-defense-inside.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162942", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13170", "source": "scrapy"},

Law, 27, tweeted earlier this week that he had been approved as a political asylum-seeker by the Home Office following a series of intervies over four months. The Hong Kong government said on Friday that it opposed the \"harboring of criminals\" by other countries, regions, organizations, or individuals. Apparently dispensing with Hong Kong's rule-of-law principle that the accused are presumed innocent until proven guilty, it said \"criminals [were alleging] that they were prosecuted for political reasons to deliberately escape justice.\" \"Any country, region, organisation or individual that harbours Hong Kong criminals in any form shows contempt for the rule of law, grossly disrespects Hong Kong's legal systems and barbarically interferes in the affairs of Hong Kong,\" it said, in comments closely resembling those made by a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing on Thursday.  \"They shall eventually bear the consequences of what they have done,\" it said. Beijing on Thursday accused the U.K. of \"harboring criminals\" after Law's asylum status was confirmed. \"The UK is clearly a platform for Hong Kong independence agitators, and provides so-called shelter for wanted criminals,\" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing in Beijing. \"The UK should immediately correct its mistake, and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs,\" Zhao said. Law said it was precisely the fact that he was wanted under the draconian national security law, that was imposed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Hong Kong from July 1, 2020, that led to his being considered at risk by the British government. \"The fact that I am wanted under the National Security Law shows that I am exposed to severe political persecution and am unlikely to return to Hong Kong without risk,\" Law wrote, citing the decision letter he received from the Home Office. He also called on the Home Office to consider accepting a broader range of evidence for Hong Kong applications. Amnesty International said the national security law had \"greatly restrict[ed] freedom of expression and other human rights in the city.\" \"The chilling effect of the NSL on Hong Kong civil society has been rapid and deeply disturbing,\" the report, issued by the Hong Kong branch of the London-based rights group, said. Two days after the law was passed, the Hong Kong government declared that the 2019 protest slogan 'Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!\" constituted an offense under clauses in the law banning pro-secessionist words and deeds, the report said. \"Individuals and businesses that had shown support for the 2019 protest movement deleted their social media posts and accounts for fear of retaliation from the authorities,\" it said. The law granted sweeping new investigatory powers to police, including the power to impose travel bans, to search people's homes, to freeze or seize their assets, and to place them under surveillance without a court order, the report said. Authorities in Hong Kong ruled on Friday that Tam Tak-chi, the detained vice chairman of the opposition party People Power, could be tried for sedition in the District Court, with no jury, despite arguments from his defense team that the court would have no jurisdiction in national security cases. Tam was arrested in September 2020 for using the protest slogans \"Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!\" and \"Five demands, not one less!\" while giving speeches on the streets of Kowloon between March and July.  Tam is also accused of shouting: \"Dirty cops, hope your family members all die!\" and of making complaints relating to police inaction during a July 21, 2019 mob attack on train passengers in Yuen Long, and to riot police attacks on passengers in Prince Edward MTR station on Aug. 31, 2019.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162943", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12529", "source": "scrapy"},

How will they learn them online? It is not possible for us to teach these children. There has to be some method to bring them back to school and also keep them safe.\" Art, craft and sports are as good as passé for children in the 5 to 10 years age-group. These fringe segments find themselves at the receiving end of the disaster and their few numbers are not represented as they deal with the most vulnerable segment.   Dr Mothukuri Ramchander, a counselling psychologist, said, \"Stress of jobs, continuing family life and finding space in homes is a challenge for many.

Of these, 20 who had successfully completed all modules were selected to move on to Stage 3, based on the results of an online test and the votes received for their recipes. They were required to make a business pitch to a jury comprising top people from the food and hospitality industry. The best 10 contestants were given financial support of `5 Lakh to launch their business with brand development support from Maggi India. Shreya was a winner under the ‘Food Delivery Business’ category.   \r\nShreya says, “I was browsing through Instagram when I saw the advertisement about the competition in January, I immediately signed up with my recipe and food business model.

It would have acted as the counterweight to the Saudi-born fundamentalist Wahhabism. And it would have been, largely, an Indian contribution. This is the thesis of Ghazala Wahab’s timely book that is simultaneously a ready-reckoner for Islam as well as an appeal to moderate Muslims to reclaim their faith. Wahab’s urgent intervention pertains to the current moral crisis afflicting Muslims who number over 1.9 billion and form about 25 per cent of the globe. Written in crisp prose filtered through a lens of empathy and humour, her quest to examine Islam draws equally on scripture, memoir and reportage. She interviews the who’s who of Muslim India from politicians and bureaucrats to seminary heads and theologians. But she also has her ear to the ground, and is careful to catch every dilemma and strand of opinion of the common man and woman, be they a humble tradesman, the “new Muslim” or the successful professional, a dadi at Shaheen Bagh or a young student at the madrassa.   So far, the discourse on the Islamic question has been chiefly contained in the West, conducted as it has been by the likes of Susan Okin (“Feminism and Multiculturalism: Some Tensions”), Ayaan Hirsi Ali (maker of  , belonging to the alt-right camp), Irshad Manji (founder of the Muslim refusenik movement), Ameena Wadud and “ex-Muslim” Sarah Haider. Barring Hasan Suroor’s important 2019 work, however, this is the first book coming out of India capturing this discourse as it plays out in this country. The last fact makes it all the more accessible to the lay reader.   The reader, for instance, may be aware that much of the problems of the moderate Indian Muslim stems from their religious obligation to follow the Muslim orthodoxy, the ulema. But did they know that, as a phenomenon, the overarching influence of the mullahs is fairly recent? It began only after the collapse of the Mughal empire, before which the influence of the Sufis who were championed by the emperor was more widespread. The predominant view about Sufism is that it exists outside Islam as a cult born out of the admixture of Hinduism with the Prophet’s faith. But this is self-serving propaganda spread by two sources, the prejudiced West which failed to reconcile the sophistication of Sufi writings with what, in its view, was a “desert religion”, and the Islamic orthodoxy itself. The origin of Sufism much predated its presence in India. Hazrat Rabia of Basra died in AD 801.     Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (AD 1058-1111) was the first scholar to lend theological heft to Sufi mysticism, marrying it with Sharia. While Golden Age (Abbasid) philosophers like Averroes and Avicenna were among the first Muslim rationalists, it was Ghazali who arguably laid the foundation of Islamic heterodoxy. He said that as long as one believed in Allah and Muhammad, Islam could be practised in different ways. Nevertheless, this ruled out the philosophy of atheism. Neither of the Abrahamic religions is known to accommodate it. Until a generation ago, there were two kinds of Muslims in India, the Communists and the conformists, Wahab says. The conformists were the regular moderate Muslims. If sceptic, they were careful to hide their worldview from the ulema. For them, the personal was not political. The Communists, on the other hand, identified as agnostic. They were, at best, cultural Muslims. While they had been drawn to this ideology because it resonated with the Islamic ideals of equality and justice, since they did not identify as true-blue Musalman, within their community, their voices went unheard. Nor did they themselves find it important to address the dogma and bigotry from within by, say, reforming the clergy. Thus Wahab illustrates the failure of Left politics to address the fundamental reality of identity as well as the Islamic problem.   Now, if Wahab is critical of Hindutva and Saudi preponderance on the clergy, she is equally irked by the Congress governments’ minority politics. Citing Wajahat Habibullah’s 2016 article, she mentions M.J. Akbar’s role in the passage of the Rajiv Gandhi government’s infamous 1986 Muslim women’s bill. It was Akbar who had prevailed on Rajiv Gandhi to contest the Shah Bano judgment, saying that if he did not, it would appear that the Prime Minister did not regard the Muslim community as his own. Akbar was subsequently seen expanding this point in a Doordarshan debate against Arif Mohammad Khan.   The Hadith is contextual, writes the author, as is the Quran. The custodians of the faith need to move with the times in order to prevent the religion from atrophying. But what if one differs from the holy book in one’s analysis of context? Is it not bowing to stereotype to regard the status of women as subhuman in tribal Arabia before the arrival of the Prophet? If so, what of the example of Khadija, the Prophet’s first wife? Should have the Prophet’s wives and honest, thereby more capable, women, rather than the already less powerful slave women, been robbed of their agency to operate in the cause of good via physical encumbrance only so as to distinguish one group from the other? Is covering up also either a moral or an ultimately effective way to combat sexist aggression? There are no easy answers. These are some areas that the book does not go into.   Elsewhere, the author does write that the opportunity for freethinking is limited when exercised from within the Islamic faith. Liberal Islam may indeed be an oxymoron, by that token. All the same, it is interesting to note how key definitions from other faiths sit perfectly inside it. The author’s own liberal rationalism is the Buddhist way of the instinct- and deed-driven mahayana, while the orthodoxy’s essentialism would be the intellect-driven hinayana way. Quite startlingly, the Hindu dichotomy of   (dual and singular manifestations of God) also exists within Islam because the Naqshbandiyah order of Sufism rejects the Chishti and other silsila on the ground that the identification of the self with Allah is subjective and does not produce any objective manifestation, hence leading to idolatry.   The author’s caveat is that the moderate Muslim even today has no voice or traction within the larger Muslim society. They are caught between the Hindu right wing that regards them as exceptional and thus invisibilises them and the Muslim right wing which disparages them for their apologism. She exhorts these people to give up their conformism and take responsibility for their beliefs. Simultaneously, she notes a rise of Muslim exceptionalism and reverse identity politics among community members in reaction to Hindutva, as evidenced in the   sloganeering during the 2019 CAA protests.   “Young working professionals are overnight discovering headscarves. The more one points to the headscarf as a symbol of Islamic patriarchy or women’s oppression, the more professional women turn up in one to register their protest.” (p. 367) Such an assertion of identity leads to the closedness of the mind in a way that runs contrary to freedom and modernism, she surmises. Clearly, a gap exists between expressions of Muslim identity and its spirit of fearless large-heartedness. It is this gap that the book strives to fill. And in so doing it perhaps becomes the vehicle through which the writer bears her own shahadah to her Muslim heritage.   By Ghazala Wahab Aleph, Rs 999", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/1c2e1c94a6acfdf3c4868602b120840eaf249bef-tc-img-columnists.jpg\" class=\"mugShotHome\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162943", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "21670", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.seelatest.com", "section": "education", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.seelatest.com/jobs/icai-ca-placement-portal-registration-begins-for-jan-feb-2021-pass-outs", "title": "\n                                        ", "author": "\n                                                                                        By ", "author_link": "https://www.seelatest.com/author/rohitsindhu", "published_date": "\n                                        ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": " Registration for Jan-Feb, 2021 CA final examination pass out candidates has begun today, on 8th April.

The MV Ever Given, longer than four football fields, has been wedged diagonally across the canal since Tuesday, strangling world supply chains and costing the global economy billions.   The stern of the boat has now moved away from the canal's western bank, according to the Vesselfinder and myshiptracking sites, a fact confirmed by an AFP source at the canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) had not published any official confirmation, and it is not yet clear when traffic along the canal will resume. But in a statement published at around 5 am local time (0300 GMT), the SCA stated that \"towing manoeuvres to refloat the container ship Ever Given have started with the help of 10 giant tugs.\" Inchcape, a maritime services company, tweeted that the ship had been \"successfully re-floated\" and was \"being secured.\" A canal official, who requested anonymity, said that the team on the ground had started technical checks, and were reassured that the ship's motor was working.   SCA chief Osama Rabie had told an Egyptian news channel at the weekend that salvage crews were working round the clock. They had focussed on efforts to remove sand around the ship, with 27,000 cubic metres (over 950,000 cubic feet) cleared at a depth of 18 metres (59 feet), SCA spokesman George Safwat said Sunday. On Sunday evening a shipping company, Leth agencies, had said Egyptian authorities had decided more tugboats were needed to shift the vessel and had postponed the refloating attempt around Sunday's high tide. The crisis has forced companies to choose between waiting or rerouting vessels around Africa, which adds a huge fuel bill, 9,000 kilometres (5,500 miles) and over a week of travel to the trip between Asia and Europe.   Each day of the blockade could be costing global trade some $6-10 billion, according to a study published Friday by German insurer Allianz. That translates to some 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points of annual trade growth each week. Authorities said 369 ships are currently stalled as they wait for the canal to reopen. Russia offered assistance Sunday, following other countries including the United States that have made similar offers. In a sign of the knock-on effects, authorities in war-wracked Syria said the crisis had hit its fuel imports from Iran and forced it to ration already scarce supplies. Romania's animal health agency said 11 ships carrying livestock out of the country were also impacted, with the charity Animals International warning of a potential \"tragedy\" affecting some 130,000 animals.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162941", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17015", "source": "scrapy"},

The policy change was originally scheduled to come into effect on February 8, the Facebook-owned company said.   It has clarified that the update does not affect data sharing with Facebook with regard to personal conversations or other profile information and only addresses business chats in the event a user converses with a company's customer service platform through WhatsApp. \"We've heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There's been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,\" WhatsApp said in a company blog. \"WhatsApp was built on a simple idea: what you share with your friends and family stays between you. This means we will always protect your personal conversations with end-to-end encryption, so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see these private messages. It's why we don't keep logs of who everyone's messaging or calling. We also can't see your shared location and we don't share your contacts with Facebook,\" it said further.   Asserting that none of that changes, the company said, \"The update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it's important people are aware of these services. This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.\" The company said it was moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms. \"No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We're also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We'll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,\" it added.   The company released a separate blog post Friday trying to clear up the confusion, and it included a chart that specifies what information is protected when someone uses WhatsApp. Facebook executives, including Instagram chief Adam Mosseri and WhatsApp head Will Cathcart, also used Twitter to try and clear up the confusion. Facebook's poor privacy track record, and the fact that WhatsApp has over time turned its sights on monetising the platform for its large international user base, has eroded trust in the chat app, which, in turn, has had the effect of turning a relatively mundane update into a worldwide controversy. WhatsApp now says it is now going to use the three-month delay to better communicate both the changes in its new policy and its long-standing privacy practices around personal chats, location sharing, and other sensitive data.   \"We're now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms,\" the blog post reads. The company said no one will be losing access to the app if they didn't agree to the new terms of service agreement that communicated the changes earlier this month. \"We're also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We'll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,\" it added.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162943", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16810", "source": "scrapy"},

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162836", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45260", "source": "scrapy"},

The latest addition to this is  . The state government on Sunday (April 11) made it mandatory for people coming from seven high load states to produce a RT-PCR negative report obtained within 72 hours of entry, from April 16 onwards. These high load states are Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. This was part of the state government’s fresh guidelines issued by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur following a spike in Covid-19 cases across the state. The government has allowed tourists to visit the state as of now, but has also directed hotel owners and tourists to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures (SoPs) issued by the government, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said. Calling it a matter of concern, the CM said that during the last 45 days, the state has reported 10,690 new COVID-19 cases, while with 120 fatalities the number of deaths have also increased rapidly. Under the new guidelines, devotees in the state have been allowed to visit temples during the Navratri festival but they will have to perform ‘puja’ and ‘darshan’ by maintaining social distancing and using face masks.  However, organising ‘langars’ or community kitchens and ‘jagran’ have been banned by the government. No overcrowding would be allowed in buses and public transport vehicles, the CM said. Earlier this week, the state government had restricted gatherings in marriage ceremonies to 50 people indoor and maximum of 200 in open space while only 50 persons would be allowed to attend funerals.

Despite this, Bangladesh has so far done 30 tests per 1,000 people, the lowest even among the South Asian countries. The Maldives has done 1,236 tests per 1,000, according to the ourworldindata.org. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) yesterday reported 5,819 confirmed cases, after testing 29,376 samples. Experts say the number of daily tests should more than double, considering the positivity rate. Otherwise, the \"lockdown\" will not be of much benefit. So far, 68,4756 people tested positive for the virus in Bangladesh. \"The number of daily tests should be raised until the positivity rate falls below 7 or 6 percent. The number of tests should be more than doubled if we are to detect and isolate the hidden cases,\" Mushtuq Hussain, consultant of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told The Daily Star. The positivity rate reported yesterday was 19.81 percent. This high level of positive rate means that there are many more undetected individuals, who are unknowingly spreading the infection, he added. Among the other South Asian countries, Bhutan is in the second position with 835 tests per 1,000 people, India third with 184, Sri Lanka fourth with 113, Nepal fifth with 79, and Pakistan sixth with 48 tests. United Arab Emirates is on top of the list with 4,022 tests followed by Denmark with 3,954 against per 1,000 people. The USA has done 1,163 tests and the UK 1,912 against per 1,000 people, according to the ourworldindata.org. Bangladesh started witnessing the second spike in daily new cases in the second week of March. The positivity rate rose to 23 percent last week. As of yesterday, the total reported death toll was 9,739, which is 1.42 percent of all confirmed cases in the country. Of those reported dead yesterday, 53 were men and 25 women. One of them was dead by the time she was taken to a hospital. The rest died at different hospitals across the country. Forty-seven of them died in Dhaka and 20 in Chattogram divisions. The demand for ICU beds in the hospitals treating Covid-19 patients was still on the rise yesterday, the DGHS said. At noon yesterday, only three out of 132 ICU beds in the 10 public hospitals for Covid-19 in Dhaka city were available. Of the 2,786 general beds at these hospitals, 311 were available. At the nine private Covid-dedicated hospitals in Dhaka, only seven out of 377 ICU beds were empty. In Chattogram, 25 out of 51 ICU beds were vacant at seven public and private hospitals, according to the DGHS.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-2\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/feature/images/2021/04/12/oxygen-support.jpg?itok=e3THVvLI&amp;c=c28199c96d1ba006ccfd371c53044443\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162941", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17568", "source": "scrapy"},

In 2016, Russian hackers from other groups were unusually noisy in their efforts to penetrate some state election databases. But Russia was called out and punished for its interference. The group has thus far stopped short of sabotage, but appears to be preparing for some future attack.

Considering the importance of the examination in admitting post-graduates in their respective subjects for further training, it is in the best interest of candidates to continue to hold this examination on the announced date. Therefore, it has been decided to add further protective measures for the candidates, towards the safe conduct of this examination.\" Candidates are advised to refrain from attending the examination if they are unwell and have COVID-like symptoms or are proven COVID-19 for their own well-being and for the safety of others.It will be mandatory for all candidates to adhere to these instructions as part of COVID Appropriate Behaviour. Same State Centre: In the wake of the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, NBE has increased the number of test centres and testing seats across the country such that candidates who had chosen the option “OTHERS” have been allotted test centres within the state of their correspondence address, thus avoiding any inter-state travel. COVID e-pass: Admit cards being issued to the candidates will bear a COVID e-pass for perusal of police & administrative authorities to facilitate the movement of the candidates in case of any travel-related restrictions. All state departments have been informed regarding the same. Staggered entry of candidates at test centres: To avoid crowding at the test venue entry, there will be staggered time slots for candidates to report. Candidates are required to respect the allotted time slots as communicated individually through emails and SMS. Isolation labs: All candidates will be checked at the entry point for recording of temperature using thermo guns. Candidates detected with above normal temperature or displaying any symptoms of COVID-19 infection will be allowed to take the examination in a separate isolation lab created for this purpose. Compulsory use of face mask: Candidates will not be permitted entry at test centres without an appropriate protective face mask. Candidates will not be allowed to carry any articles with them (such as water bottles, gloves etc) other than the admit card and entry-related documents required for verification purposes.

It will be mandatory for all candidates to wear the face shield at all times and during entry & exit where crowding is anticipated. Face shield will be required to be taken off during registration process and whenever face ID is verified during the exam.

Authorities in the central Chinese province of Hunan are believed to have secretly tried and jailed three non-governmental organization (NGO) workers, Cheng Yuan, Liu Dazhi, and Wuge Jianxiong, for \"subversion of state power\" in September after holding them incommunicado for nearly 18 months. Cheng's wife Shi Minglei arrived in the U.S. with the couple's daughter on April 7, with the help of the Christian rights group ChinaAid.  Shortly after landing, Shi tweeted: \"Cheng Yuan's wife and daughter are free!\" \"Easter has just ended, and we have said goodbye to darkness ... and brought me and our five-year-old daughter to freedom, with the help of ChinaAid,\" she wrote. Shi told RFA after her arrival that she still has no documentation to show that Cheng and the others have indeed been tried or sentenced. \"They acted illegally at every stage of the case,\" she said. \"From the persecution of the family members following Cheng's arrest, to the later stages when the case had been sent to court.\" \"That has to be the reason that the authorities haven't made any details of the case public so far.\" The three defendants have been denied meetings with attorneys hired by their families since being detained on July 22, 2019. The lawyers were told in March 2020 that the defenders had \"dismissed\" them and that the government had assigned them government-funded lawyers. But the families said they believe that the lawyers were fired under duress, and said they have had no contact with the government-appointed lawyers. For now, Shi said she was relieved to be beyond the reach of the state security police. \"It wasn't easy for us to get to the United States,\" she said. \"I am very grateful that my daughter is now free, and that we can't be used as hostages, or as a way to threaten Cheng Yuan.\" Changsha Funeng co-founder Yang Zhanqing, who now lives in the U.S., said the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) often uses political cases involving public dissent or rights activism to make an example of its critics. The fact that they are not doing that in this case suggests that even the authorities can't believe in the charges against the Changsha Three. \"I'm guessing there is no evidence at all, and no legal basis at all [for bringing this case],\" Yang told RFA. \"It's purely a form of official retaliation.\" Yang had earlier said that the three men were targeted because their rights work had received overseas funding, which the ruling Chinese Communist Party regards as \"collusion with hostile foreign forces,\" and a threat to its national security. Last year, San Francisco district supervisor Gordon Mar called in a letter to the city's mayor for the city administration to rethink its twinning ties to Changsha following the treatment meted out to the Changsha Three. In a Dec. 24 letter to San Francisco mayor London Breed, Mar called on the city authorities to reconsider the twinning arrangement with Changsha, and for a letter to be sent to her Chinese counterpart Zheng Jianxin calling for the trio's release.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162943", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12031", "source": "scrapy"},

The idea of SportVolt was introduced and implemented in the year 2016 by  . The fundamental concept behind SportVolt was to make India a sports superpower. “The aim was to focus on the grassroots level and identify and harness the talent that is currently overlooked’ tells Mr.Tewari. Kshitij was turned down by numerous investors before finally deciding to go ahead with the project based of a small family loan of 500 USD. Chasing the vision and not the money, Kshitij led SportVolt into being a profitable enterprise since the year of its inception with a projected revenue of 3 Million USD in FY20-21 and has already secured a revenue of 1 Million USD in the first two quarter. Under the guidance of his father, Col  , an army veteran and a UNESCO awardee, the team then decided to expand operations with the establishment of   an organisation dedicated towards trading and promoting locally made products. “We wanted to take the same sentiment and work ethic and leverage our grassroots network to identify and promote industries with local ownerships” states Mr. Raghav Sharma, Director at RushKash. Both ventures soon saw various additions came in their respective portfolios. SportVolt entered the healthcare, manpower and capacity building sectors. ‘With a core competency in personnel training, manpower and capacity building seemed like an obvious choice, and being involved with sports and wellness, healthcare was a sector we always had an inkling towards’ says Kshitij. RushKash has also observed the addition of realty services in its project operations. Kshitij and his team were all set to enter a new phase of expansion with plans to enter the defense sector but due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, those plans were derailed. The team decided to regroup and design a fresh strategy. This led towards the advent of Tewari Enterprises, with Col Prakash Tewari at the helm. In no time   came to fruition and is now moulding its way in GIS and GPS based tech and bulletproofing solutions. “Our aim through the Tewari Group is to consolidate all our operations and have them working in synchronicity and deliver bundled experiences as opposed to a single point deliverable” expresses Col Tewari, who has previously served as the Executive Director – CSR for DLF Ltd, prior to which he had served in identical roles at Jindal Steel and Power and Tata Power Company. The Tewari group has currently decided to not seek any outside investment in the near future, a decision that can be considered a feat in its own.", "image_url": "<img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201106-WA0007.jpg\" class=\"attachment- size- wp-post-image\" alt=\"Tewari\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201106-WA0007.jpg 960w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201106-WA0007-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201106-WA0007-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162947", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

This implies that kids remain active carriers of coronavirus even if their symptoms have subsided or even if they're simply asymptomatic. The study was published in Nature Medicine on March 13 and further reaffirmed the need to shut down schools globally in order to limit the contact of infected children with others. In the United States, local school districts have suspended all classroom activity. This has been replaced by the online model of schooling. According to this study, shutting down schools is in the best interests of the society for there's no clarity on whether children could pass the virus to others in the community. The study was led by Huimin Xia, of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, in Guangzhou, China. All 745 subjects were babies and children. The age-range stood between two months to 15 years, and the children were selected based on their \"close contact with diagnosed [COVID-19] patients or were members of families with reported familial outbreaks\". \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nOut of the 745, only 10 tested positive for the virus and were admitted to a treatment facility, simply with the aim to protect others around them. It's imperative to note here that none of them showed any significant illness. Additionally, none of the ten kids showed any severe symptoms. Even in the seven cases that developed fever, nobody exhibited a temperature of over 29 degrees Celsius. \"There were some instances of coughing, sore throat and nasal congestion,\" the journal news release noted, but \"none of the other symptoms commonly seen in adult patients, such as muscle ache and headache.\"  Further tests like x-rays displayed no signs of pneumonia among the children. However, children with mild symptoms or no symptoms may still be able to transfer the virus to vulnerable adults. The worst part is that the kids may sustain the virus for way longer than expected, which makes them a harmful carrier group, especially towards the susceptible groups of populations.   This was ascertained by the researchers based on the swab results of the kids, which had come out negative. However, their stool still tested positive for the virus, suggesting that a minimal amount of virus might be able to sustain itself for longer inside children. A peculiar case involved a child's stool testing positive 13 days after they were discharged from the hospital. The kid had tested negative for throat/nose swabs twice. This brings into question the protocols in place for isolation. Most institutions suggest 14 days of the quarantine period.  \r\n \r\n\"Quarantine timings are currently assessed through the use of nose or throat swabs; however, these results suggest that gastrointestinal-tract testing may help to provide more accurate assessments of treatment effectiveness and recovery\", the news release said.   \"It's important to understand that viral shedding [in stool samples] seen in this small study does not equate with the transmission,\" Glatter said. \"While children may still shed virus in their stool, we don't know whether they may still be infectious and serve as a reservoir of ongoing transmission.\" Still, \"the report suggests that rectal swab testing may be a more sensitive indicator compared to nasal sampling regarding the effectiveness of treatment and when to end quarantine,\" Glatter added.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/17/133396-untitled-design-3.jpg?itok=PA8bJRPj\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162943", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22396", "source": "scrapy"},

The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to prepare for the launch of such workplace vaccination. According to news agency  , Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries said a substantial proportion of the population aged 45 years and above is in the organised sector of the economy and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private) or manufacturing and services. \"In order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations,   vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing COVID vaccination centre,\" Bhushan said in the letter . He said the states can initiate due consultations with private/public sector employers and management to prepare for launch of workplace vaccination. \"Such workplace vaccination centres may be launched across states/Union Territories from 11 April, 2021,\" he said. The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to make adequate preparations and issued guidelines in this regard. According to the government's guidance note, workplace vaccination sessions may be organised to facilitate optimal utilization of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage. \"Organizing vaccination at the workplace will not only be convenient to the staff at workplaces but also help to avoid travel and hence reducing the risk of exposure to   virus,\" it said. According to the guidelines, only employees aged 45 years or more will be eligible for vaccination at workplaces and no outsiders including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination. One of the senior staff of the organisation will be assigned to work as nodal officer to coordinate with district health authorities/ private COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) and support vaccination activities. The beneficiaries will be required to register in Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination and CVC nodal officer will ensure registration of all targeted beneficiaries and facility of on-the-spot registration will also be available but only to employees of the workplace, the guidelines said. Once identified, the workplace   vaccination centres will also have to register on the Co-WIN portal as government or private CVC at workplace. For optimal utilisation of resources, vaccination sessions will be planned at workplace CVC once at least 50 beneficiaries get registered for vaccination. \"The schedule of vaccination sessions can be made up to 15 days in advance and intimated to the workplaces so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of vaccination. In most of the workplaces vaccination schedules may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,\" the Centre told states and union territories in the guidelines. The District Task Force chaired by district magistrate and Urban Task Force chaired by municipal commissioner will identify such government and private workplaces after due deliberations with relevant employers. Every CVC in a government workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the government medical facility while every CVC in a private workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the private medical facility. The designated government and private CVC to whom the workplace CVC has been tagged will be responsible for the deployment of the vaccination team at workplace CVCs. All government and private CVCs are already linked to some cold chain points for receiving vaccines. \"These CVCs will continue to use the same mechanism to receive the vaccine needed for vaccination at tagged workplace CVC,\" the guidelines said. \"Some of the work places may have health infrastructure in form of hospitals, health clinics, nursing centers, etc. This infrastructure may be utilized to set-up vaccination site in case sufficient space for waiting, vaccination and observation rooms are available,\" the guidelines stated. The healthcare workers of this health infrastructure of the workplace CVCs (such as doctors, nurses and other staff) may be deployed for the   vaccination activities at workplaces as vaccination team members, it said. The workplace CVCs staff engaged in   vaccination activities will follow the same SOPs for vaccination and reporting including management and reporting of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The government has also spelled out the requirements for AEFI management at the workplace CVCs. In order to avoid mixing of vaccine types in first and second dose, only one type of vaccine will be provided at such sessions that are conducted at the workplaces.

Its UK counterpart, however, said it would offer people under 30 the choice of another product. The European Medicines Agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. It said most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination — but based on the currently available evidence, it was not able to identify specific risk factors. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the United Kingdom, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. “The reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine,” said Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director. But it placed no new age restrictions on using the vaccine in people 18 and over, as some countries have done. “The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects.,” Cooke said. Dr. June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, echoed that sentiment, saying that the benefits “continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.” She called the unusual clots a “potential side effect” of the vaccine and said the evidence was “firming up,” but more study was needed to be sure. The EMA, the World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against   outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots. The announcements could have far-reaching effects on the use of the shot that is key to global efforts to end the pandemic. The EMA's investigation was particularly focused on two types of rare blood clots: one that appears in multiple blood vessels and another that occurs in a vein that drains blood from the brain. It also evaluated reports of people who had low levels of blood platelets, which puts them at risk of severe bleeding. As recently as last week, the EMA said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population” — a response to several countries doing just that — though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected. In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine. Meanwhile, Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, never suspended use of the vaccine. The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic. Dr Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine globally could have serious consequences. “We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said. That’s because the vaccine is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries. It has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine. The governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region had said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot. “If they do like Germany, and allow Astra Zeneca only to people over 65, that would be absurd. Before it was only for people under 55. Put yourself in the place of citizens, it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters on Wednesday. The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary. “If there are in fact individuals of a certain age group that could have a higher risk (of clotting) then we need to adjust its use,” Casado told Spanish public radio. “We are not questioning AstraZeneca. We need all the vaccines possible to reach the goal of 70% of the adult population.” French health authorities said they, too, were awaiting EMA’s conclusions and would follow the agency’s recommendations, especially for the 500,000 people who have received the first dose of AstraZeneca. Even officials in Asia said they were keen to hear the EMA's decision. On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said it would also pause a vaccine rollout to school nurses and teachers that was to begin on Thursday while awaiting the outcome of the EMA’s review. English, the former chair of a British Medical Association committee, said that even rare, serious side effects are seen with established vaccines and that policymakers often decide that bigger public health goals warrant their use, citing the polio vaccine as an example. For every million doses that are given of the oral polio vaccine, about one child is paralyzed from the live virus contained in the vaccine. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which developed the vaccine, paused a study of the shot in children while the U.K. regulator evaluates the link between the shot and rare blood clots in adults.", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\" alt=\"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/astrazeneca-AP.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162949", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "39845", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the second time that regulator has extended the deadline as several players have failed to implement the framework which could have impacted recurring payments of customers such as of utility bills, recharge of phone, DTH among others, post March 31 and led to large scale defaults. To make digital payments in India \"safe and secure\", the banking regulator introduced Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) and directed all banks including Regional Rural Banks, Non Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) and payment gateways to comply with AFA for automatic recurring payment by March 31, 2021, in order to make digital transaction safe and protect customers from fraudulent transactions.However, some of the players failed to meet the deadline and approached the RBI seeking extension of the deadline.   \"It is, however, noted that the framework has not been fully implemented even after the extended timeline. This non-compliance is noted with serious concern and will be dealt with separately. The delay in implementation by some stakeholders has given rise to a situation of possible large-scale customer inconvenience and default,\" RBI said in its statement. \"To prevent any inconvenience to the customers, Reserve Bank of India has decided to extend the timeline for the stakeholders to migrate to the framework by six months, i.e., till September 30, 2021,\" it said. \"Any further delay in ensuring complete adherence to the framework beyond the extended timeline will attract stringent supervisory action,\" the RBI warned.   In August 2019, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued a framework for processing of e-mandates on recurring online transactions. Initially applicable to cards and wallets, the framework was extended in January 2020 to cover Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions as well. In the interest of customer convenience and safety in the use of recurring online payments, the framework mandated use of AFA during registration and first transaction (with relaxation for subsequent transactions up to a limit of Rs 2,000, since enhanced to Rs 5,000), as well as pre-transaction notification, facility to withdraw the mandate, etc, it said. \"The primary objective of the framework was to protect customers from fraudulent transactions and enhance customer convenience. Based on a request from Indian Banks' Association (IBA) for an extension of time till March 31, 2021, to enable the banks to complete the migration, Reserve Bank had advised the \r\nstakeholders in December 2020 to migrate to the framework by March 31, 2021.

Their stupendous performance in last year’s IPL earned them a ticket to Team India. Their inclusion has once accentuated the significance of playing well in the IPL. But unfortunately, the competition was so intense that neither of them could find a place in the playing X1 in the ODI team. Krunal Pandya replaced Suryakumar Yadav for the ODIs; in fact, the latter made his ODI debut against England last Tuesday and scored a record 26-ball 50. \r\nSimilarly, despite some good performances, K.L. Rahul is facing stiff competition from Rishab Pant as a wicket-keeping batsman.   And with the next edition of IPL set to happen next month, more new faces are likely to emerge, putting existing performers in trouble. Ishan and Suryakumar were among the 12 batsmen who scored 350-plus runs in last year’s IPL. Naturally, they were drafted into the National side for the recent T-20 series against England. Cricket administrator and former Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) for Kolkata Knight Riders Makarand Waingankar agrees that IPL has helped many cricketers to play for Team India. He adds that the format has given the players a great opportunity to play against international cricketers much before they make their international debut.   “Youngsters have become fearless because of their IPL stints. The situation is so dynamic that it has become challenging for players to retain their spots in the team,” points out Makarand, and adds that sometimes even top performers have to be dropped because of the competition. “Team India won matches in Australia even without Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, etc. But now if they come back, where do you slot them?” he asks. While former greats like Sachin Tendulkar, M.S. Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, etc., had the luxury of playing the game almost till their 40s, the situation for the current crop looks grim. At a time where even performers are being left out due to high competition, cricketers’ longevity on the field is in jeopardy.   Sports analyst and historian Sunil Yashkalra describes the current situation as a ‘problem of plenty’. Commenting that league tournaments are the germination points of talent, he feels having a long stint like Dhoni, Sachin and Yuvraj could be difficult these days. “Today, longevity depends on not just skill but on temperament and fitness,” shares Sunil. He feels intense fitness will be the key differentiator for longevity in the game. “Vihari has done so well, but just one injury, and he is out of the team. And with the IPL taking place next month, the competition is even more intense, it makes things even tougher. Hence it is significant that a player stays injury-free,” he stresses.   Former Indian cricketer and former coach of the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, Lalchand Rajput, reminisces that during his tenure, fitness was never a parameter. During the ’80s there wasn’t much emphasis on fitness, but only skill, he explains, adding that today, a player first needs to be an athlete to make the cut. Observers feel that while Team India may not soon see the likes of Sachin, Sehwag and Dhoni who played for several years, the BCCI should follow a strict rotation policy, where a mandatory rest is given to players after taking part in a certain number of matches.   Former cricketer and Chief selector M.S.K. Prasad says that before he took charge, there were only 20 players playing all three formats (Test, ODI and T-20). He had visualized developing sustainable bench strength over a period of time to nurture the team to where it is now. “Bench strength (competition) will certainly challenge senior players’ longevity. With youngsters chipping in, it will also push seniors to perform better, so eventually, it will help Team India,” explains Prasad, who points out that Indian won the test series against Australia despite not having its seven main players.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162949", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17213", "source": "scrapy"},

Huang shot to fame in Taiwan in 2019 after she rolled her eyes at then-Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu as she questioned him during a meeting, earning herself the media nickname \"Goddess of the Eyeroll.\" Huang won plaudits from people concerned about Han's plans for a trade agreement with China for pinning Han down in a bid to figure out exactly what such an agreement would entail. Han, who was elected on a pro-China, pro-business platform for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), went on to lose his job in 2020 to a voter recall campaign, in which more than 97 percent of those who voted wanted him gone. The recall came after Han lost the January 2020 presidential election to Tsai by a margin of two-and-a-half million votes after Tsai campaigned to lessen Chinese influence and attempts to undermine the island's democracy, citing Beijing's treatment of Hong Kong as an example. But in February this year, Han's supporters launched an unsuccessful bid to recall Huang, based on her alleged violation of a draconian national security law imposed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Hong Kong. Huang wept public tears of joy at the time. But her view of the campaign is much more sobering, two months after the event. \"I think it's hard to know whether to laugh or cry, actually,\" Huang told RFA in a recent interview. \"We live in a free society, but they use its privileges to strike a blow for totalitarian rule.\" \"Now I think I can say with much greater certainty that I didn't do anything wrong,\" she said. \"The majority of people stood by me, so we should keep working to promote that philosophy.\" She said the jailing of most of Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp and the banning of speech linked to the 2019 protest movement had woken Taiwan's 23 million people up to the potential dangers of cooperation with China. \"Such huge changes have taken place, not very long after the [1997] handover of Hong Kong,\" Huang said. \"People in Taiwan are much more vigilant.\" \"It's so easy for freedom and democracy to just disappear one day, so we should increase our efforts to guard this last bastion of democracy,\" Huang said. Huang has never been to Hong Kong, and now that she has spoken out against the crackdown, she is unlikely to risk arrest by going there in future. But she is at peace with her decisions, and called on more people to be outspoken about China's human rights violations. \"If everyone is afraid, then nobody will be willing to speak out about such things,\" Huang said. Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was occupied by the 1911 Republic of China under the Kuomintang (KMT) as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal with the allies. It has never been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, nor formed part of the People's Republic of China, but Beijing insists it will reclaim the island, by force if necessary. Public opinion polls have shown that the violent suppression of Hong Kong's anti-government protest movement last year fueled fears for Taiwan's national security and democracy, and that only around 4.5 percent of Taiwan's 23 million people welcome the idea of Chinese rule. The island began a transition to democracy following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162947", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12285", "source": "scrapy"},

Earlier on Wednesday, the Maharashtra government had said that the state was  , especially in urban centres, and urged the Centre to send in additional stocks. The official notification issued by the Panvel Municipal Corporation read: \"Vaccination drive temporarily halted in all government and private inoculation centres in Panvel, due to unavailability of #COVID19 vaccines. Centres will be reopened once vaccines are back in stock.\" Pune also shut over 100 vaccination centres because of vaccine shortage, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule tweeted last night. She also alleged that several people had to return home without getting vaccinated. \"Pune District vaccinated 55,539 persons in 391 vaccination centres today. Several thousand people went back without being vaccinated because the vaccines stock was exhausted,\" tweeted Sule. \"109 centres remained shut today because they had no stock of vaccines. Our momentum may be lost due to lack of stock, we remain determined to vaccinate every consenting person to save lives, to break the chain of infection and to get our economy back on its feet at the earliest. Requesting Honorable Dr Harsh Vardhan ji to kindly help us with the COVID 19 vaccines,\" she said. State health minister   also flagged fast-depleting stocks and said people have to be sent back due to the paucity. Tope said the state government has also demanded from the Centre to inoculate people from the age group of 20-40 years on priority. \"We do not have enough vaccine doses at various vaccination centres, and people have to be sent back due to a shortage of doses. We have demanded from the Centre that people of age group 20-40 years must be vaccinated on priority,\"   had quoted Tope as saying. The health minister said the state currently has 14 lakh vaccine doses which will get consumed in over three days. But Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan launched a scathing attack on the Maharashtra government over vaccine shortage claims and termed it a \"deplorable attempt to distract attention from the failures and spread panic among the people.\" The \"lackadaisical attitude\" of Maharashtra had bogged down the entire country's efforts to fight the virus, he added. Meawhile, Maharashtra continues to report the highest number of daily cases in the country. The state reported 59,907 new   cases and 322 deaths in the last 24 hours. With 1,15,736 new   cases in the past 24 hours, India recorded its daily highest spike on Wednesday. The total count of cases in the country has reached 1,28,01,785. The cumulative toll mounted to 1,66,177 after 630 COVID-related deaths were reported in a day, while the active number of cases stands at 8,43,473, the health ministry said on Wednesday.", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Maharashtra: COVID-19 inoculation drive temporarily halted in Pune, Panvel and Satara due to shortage of doses\" alt=\"Maharashtra: COVID-19 inoculation drive temporarily halted in Pune, Panvel and Satara due to shortage of doses\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/covid19AP-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162949", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "43024", "source": "scrapy"},

The move comes even as India's drug regulator has extended Covishield's shelf life from six to nine months from its manufacturing date. In a recent communique to Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the WHO has also asked the firm to formulate the doses with enough titer and/or implement a higher specification at release so that the minimum specification of= 2.5 x108ifu/dose is fulfilled throughout the shelf life. Shelf life is the length of time for which an item remains fit for use. The DCGI in a letter to SII in February said it has no objection in respect of 'extension of shelf life of Covishield vaccine' in a multi-dose glass vial (10 dose-5ml) from six months to nine months. \"You are permitted to apply the shelf life of nine months to unlabelled vials available on hand, subject to the condition that the details of such stock, batch-wise, shall be submitted to this office and Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli,\" DCGI Dr V G Somani had said in the letter. The DCGI's decision will help health authorities in reducing vaccine wastage. According to an update by the UK drug regulator dated February 22, the shelf-life of the AstraZeneca   vaccine is six months. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the vaccine as the European Union's health agency concluded a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and rare blood clots but stressed that the benefits of the vaccine to protect against   continue to outweigh the risks. The UK's medicines regulator on Wednesday said that under-30s in the country will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to \"evolving evidence\" linking it to rare blood clots.

Li, 30, was among a group of 12 Hong Kong activists intercepted on Aug. 23, 2020 by the China Coast Guard aboard a speedboat that is believed to have been heading for the democratic island of Taiwan. Li and seven other detainees subsequently served seven months in jail for \"illegally crossing a border,\" before being handed over to the Hong Kong police on March 22. According to a report in the   newspaper last month, Li is currently being held in solitary confinement at the maximum-security Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre, which the paper said \"has a history of alleged abuses against its inmates.\" He was arrested by the Hong Kong police soon after arriving back in the city, under a draconian national security law imposed on Hong Kong by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from July 1, 2020. Both the city's police force and the Correctional Services Department (CSD) had told his family they had no record of where he was being held. According to the , Li’s case is being handled by a special unit in the CSD colloquially known as the \"secret unit.\" Five fellow speedboat detainees were remanded in custody on Monday after appearing briefly at Shatin Magistrates' Court at the end of their 14-day quarantine period, government broadcaster RTHK reported. Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, and Yim Man-him face charges of conspiracy to wound with intent and possession of an offensive weapon or other instrument fit for unlawful purpose, the report said. Their cases have been adjourned to May 3 at Eastern Court. Kok Tsz-lun is charged with possession of an instrument fit for unlawful purpose and with intent to use for any unlawful purpose. His case was adjourned to May 5 at Tuen Mun Magistrates' Court, RTHK said, while the next hearing date for Wong Wai-yin, charged with making explosives, has been set for May 3 at Fanling Magistrates' Court. Meanwhile, police stepped up their patrols of a remote hillside cemetery after floral offerings began appearing over the weekend on anonymous graves, marking the Ching Ming festival of grave-tending and the honoring of ancestors, Visitors to Sandy Ridge Cemetery, where unclaimed corpses are buried, burned incense and paper offerings, as well as laying fruit, flowers, and other offerings at unmarked graves. Some of the offerings bore the symbols of the 2019 protest movement, which have largely been banned since the CCP's national security law took effect. One of the visitors, Chan Kei-kau, said he was a member of the Protect the Children group of mostly Christian volunteers supporting young protesters in 2019. Chan said he felt the need to honor \"people who died in unknown circumstances.\" Many of the visitors who left offerings at the unmarked graves wore black clothing, a color typically associated by the 2019 protest movement. There was a strong police presence at the cemetery throughout the holiday weekend, and police were taking the ID card numbers of anyone entering the section containing unmarked graves. Police also closed off a nearby intersection and set up roadblocks to ensure that non-residents couldn't enter the area near the cemetery by vehicle, but only on foot. Throughout the 2019 protest movement, reports continued to circulate on social media citing protester disappearances and deaths reported by the authorities as suicide, prompting recurrent rumors that some protesters had lost their lives far from the public eye. Protesters have repeatedly laid wreaths and other tributes outside Prince Edward MTR station following persistent reports that deaths occurred inside when riot police stormed the station on Aug. 31. The selective release of surveillance footage from cameras inside the station by the Mass Transit Rail Corp. did little to assuage public mistrust in the police, who have been repeatedly accused by protesters, medical personnel, and human rights groups of the mistreatment, torture, and sexual abuse of arrestees since protests escalated in early June. In October 2019, dozens of people paid their respects to Chan Yin-lam, a 15-year-old competitive swimmer who was ruled to have died by drowning after her body was found floating in the sea near Tseung Kwan O. Chan Yin-lam had been enrolled on a youth training course at the Hong Kong Design Institute at the time of her death. Police said there were no marks of violence on her body, although it was found naked, and that her death wasn't being treated as suspicious.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162950", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12944", "source": "scrapy"},

The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to prepare for the launch of such workplace vaccination. According to news agency  , Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries said a substantial proportion of the population aged 45 years and above is in the organised sector of the economy and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private) or manufacturing and services. \"In order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations,   vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing COVID vaccination centre,\" Bhushan said in the letter . He said the states can initiate due consultations with private/public sector employers and management to prepare for launch of workplace vaccination. \"Such workplace vaccination centres may be launched across states/Union Territories from 11 April, 2021,\" he said. The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to make adequate preparations and issued guidelines in this regard. According to the government's guidance note, workplace vaccination sessions may be organised to facilitate optimal utilization of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage. \"Organizing vaccination at the workplace will not only be convenient to the staff at workplaces but also help to avoid travel and hence reducing the risk of exposure to   virus,\" it said. According to the guidelines, only employees aged 45 years or more will be eligible for vaccination at workplaces and no outsiders including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination. One of the senior staff of the organisation will be assigned to work as nodal officer to coordinate with district health authorities/ private COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) and support vaccination activities. The beneficiaries will be required to register in Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination and CVC nodal officer will ensure registration of all targeted beneficiaries and facility of on-the-spot registration will also be available but only to employees of the workplace, the guidelines said. Once identified, the workplace   vaccination centres will also have to register on the Co-WIN portal as government or private CVC at workplace. For optimal utilisation of resources, vaccination sessions will be planned at workplace CVC once at least 50 beneficiaries get registered for vaccination. \"The schedule of vaccination sessions can be made up to 15 days in advance and intimated to the workplaces so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of vaccination. In most of the workplaces vaccination schedules may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,\" the Centre told states and union territories in the guidelines. The District Task Force chaired by district magistrate and Urban Task Force chaired by municipal commissioner will identify such government and private workplaces after due deliberations with relevant employers. Every CVC in a government workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the government medical facility while every CVC in a private workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the private medical facility. The designated government and private CVC to whom the workplace CVC has been tagged will be responsible for the deployment of the vaccination team at workplace CVCs. All government and private CVCs are already linked to some cold chain points for receiving vaccines. \"These CVCs will continue to use the same mechanism to receive the vaccine needed for vaccination at tagged workplace CVC,\" the guidelines said. \"Some of the work places may have health infrastructure in form of hospitals, health clinics, nursing centers, etc. This infrastructure may be utilized to set-up vaccination site in case sufficient space for waiting, vaccination and observation rooms are available,\" the guidelines stated. The healthcare workers of this health infrastructure of the workplace CVCs (such as doctors, nurses and other staff) may be deployed for the   vaccination activities at workplaces as vaccination team members, it said. The workplace CVCs staff engaged in   vaccination activities will follow the same SOPs for vaccination and reporting including management and reporting of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The government has also spelled out the requirements for AEFI management at the workplace CVCs. In order to avoid mixing of vaccine types in first and second dose, only one type of vaccine will be provided at such sessions that are conducted at the workplaces. While the anti-   vaccination at government workplaces organised by district health authorities will be free of cost, inoculation organised by private CVC would be on payment basis and will be charged the same rate as that for vaccination at private health facility (Rs 250 per person per dose).  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Centre to allow COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces having 100 eligible beneficiaries from 11 April\" alt=\"Centre to allow COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces having 100 eligible beneficiaries from 11 April\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Covid-Vaccination_PTI_640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162950", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "43446", "source": "scrapy"},

Its UK counterpart, however, said it would offer people under 30 the choice of another product. The European Medicines Agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. It said most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination — but based on the currently available evidence, it was not able to identify specific risk factors. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the United Kingdom, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. “The reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine,” said Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director. But it placed no new age restrictions on using the vaccine in people 18 and over, as some countries have done. “The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects.,” Cooke said. Dr. June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, echoed that sentiment, saying that the benefits “continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.” She called the unusual clots a “potential side effect” of the vaccine and said the evidence was “firming up,” but more study was needed to be sure. The EMA, the World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against   outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots. The announcements could have far-reaching effects on the use of the shot that is key to global efforts to end the pandemic. The EMA's investigation was particularly focused on two types of rare blood clots: one that appears in multiple blood vessels and another that occurs in a vein that drains blood from the brain. It also evaluated reports of people who had low levels of blood platelets, which puts them at risk of severe bleeding. As recently as last week, the EMA said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population” — a response to several countries doing just that — though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected. In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine. Meanwhile, Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, never suspended use of the vaccine. The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic. Dr Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine globally could have serious consequences. “We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said. That’s because the vaccine is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries. It has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine. The governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region had said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot. “If they do like Germany, and allow Astra Zeneca only to people over 65, that would be absurd. Before it was only for people under 55. Put yourself in the place of citizens, it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters on Wednesday. The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary. “If there are in fact individuals of a certain age group that could have a higher risk (of clotting) then we need to adjust its use,” Casado told Spanish public radio. “We are not questioning AstraZeneca. We need all the vaccines possible to reach the goal of 70% of the adult population.” French health authorities said they, too, were awaiting EMA’s conclusions and would follow the agency’s recommendations, especially for the 500,000 people who have received the first dose of AstraZeneca. Even officials in Asia said they were keen to hear the EMA's decision. On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said it would also pause a vaccine rollout to school nurses and teachers that was to begin on Thursday while awaiting the outcome of the EMA’s review. English, the former chair of a British Medical Association committee, said that even rare, serious side effects are seen with established vaccines and that policymakers often decide that bigger public health goals warrant their use, citing the polio vaccine as an example. For every million doses that are given of the oral polio vaccine, about one child is paralyzed from the live virus contained in the vaccine. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which developed the vaccine, paused a study of the shot in children while the U.K. regulator evaluates the link between the shot and rare blood clots in adults.", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\" alt=\"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/astrazeneca-AP.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162950", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "39845", "source": "scrapy"},

The team is preparing for the forthcoming IPL to be held from 09 April. As part of the protocol, the entire SRH team has been in quarantine and living in a bio bubble since March 28. Incidentally, the players have not been allowed to go out of their hotel rooms to even start practice until they tested negative for the third time too.   In an interaction with Deccan Chronicle, SRH’s mentor V.V.S. Laxman talks about how his players are upbeat and looking forward to an exciting tournament. “The boys just had a go at the nets and it’s been pretty good,” Laxman shares. “Most of the Indian players played domestic cricket (Vijay Hazare tourney) while the foreign players played for their respective national sides. So we are trying to capitalise this entire week for our practice sessions.” Even so, IPL for Laxman has always been such a tournament in which the players have to gel well as a team. “And the good thing is that we [SRH] always played well as a cohesive unit and that’s been our strength,” he states, adding, “In fact, we are one of the most consistent teams in the last few years.”   Having retained their core group for the 2021 season, SRH looks strong in batting with the likes of David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy, Kane Williamson, Manish Padey, etc. So too, Laxman is quite certain that SRH has the potential to beat any side. But added to the confidence in his team members’ performance is his assurance that the team has taken back lessons from IPL’s last season in Dubai. “I think overall it’s important to get a good quick breakthroughs. I believe winning crucial moments is significant,” he states. The franchise has, nevertheless, been criticised for depending heavily on the top order. But Laxman is undeterred by the talk and says that the team has players who can strengthen middle order too.   “This season players such as Kedar Jadhav will boost our depth in the batting; his experience will not only add diversity but also strike a balance in the line-up,” assures the former India cricketer. The batting great further revels in the fact that the team has got players who can perform in any conditions. None of his confidence in his team, however, means he is blinded to their weaknesses, the mark of a true mentor. “An area we need to work on is to maintain the positive frame of mind and attitude of the players when they are part of the bubble for a long time.”   Laxman is also convinced that as the players have been part of the bio bubble in the earlier series too, getting into the groove will not be so difficult. \r\nEven as the IPL time is being held in India this year, the Hyderabadi batsman is aware that the strategy for tourneys of such magnitude keeps changing. “Strategies change according to the situations, conditions, pitch, opposition, etc. But luckily we’ve got players who can execute strategies even in the toughest conditions. So winning the tournament is all about seizing the momentum early and sustaining it. And for this, players have to be consistent and tough — physically and mentally tough.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162950", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16913", "source": "scrapy"},

This was the president’s first direct comment on the issue since Philippine government officials said that Chinese militia ships were spotted moored together at Whitsun Reef in the Spratly Islands last month. “We will continue to resolve the issues on Julian Felipe through diplomatic channels and through peaceful means,” Duterte spokesman Harry Roque said, reading a statement from the president that used the Philippine name for Whitsun Reef. “Whatever differences we have with China will not define our bilateral relations.\" “It will not be an obstacle to the overall positive trajectory of our bilateral friendly relations and our deepening cooperation in pandemic response, including vaccine cooperation and in post-pandemic recovery,” he said. Julian Felipe, or Whitsun Reef, is within the Philippines’ 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In recent days, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana has engaged in a war of words with the Chinese Embassy over the ongoing presence of dozens of Chinese ships in the area. After cancelling a news conference, which he had scheduled for Tuesday on the issue, Lorenzana announced he had tested positive for COVID-19 and would be observing quarantine guidelines. On Monday, the Department of Foreign Affairs threatened to file daily diplomatic protests against China until Beijing removed its ships from the Philippine EEZ. In a Facebook post two days earlier, the Chinese Embassy had said the ships were in Beijing’s territory. “The Niu’e Jiao is part of China’s Nansha Islands. The waters around Niu’e Jiao have been a traditional fishing ground for Chinese fishermen for many years,” the statement said. Niu’e Jiao is the Chinese name for the Whitsun Reef. The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to requests from BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service,  for comment on Tuesday. Beijing claims nearly all of the South China Sea as its own while six other Asian governments – Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam – have their own claims overlapping China’s. While Indonesia does not regard itself as party to the South China Sea dispute, Beijing claims historic rights to parts of the sea that overlap Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. The Philippines began its coronavirus inoculation program in early March, using vaccines donated by a Chinese state-run firm, Sinovac. Doses of British-Swedish AstraZeneca vaccines arrived and have been given out as well.  “China has been giving us everything but never asked anything from us actually,” Duterte had said in February when the Philippines took delivery of 600,000 doses of vaccine developed by Sinovac. The Philippines has received 2.5 million vaccine doses from Sinovac and AstraZeneca and has administered 855,000 vaccinations as of Tuesday, according to a document released by Carlito Galvez, the official who leads the government’s vaccine procurement efforts. Galvez, a former military general, said Chinese vaccines and China’s moves in the South China Sea were separate issues. “The Chinese government is joining us in fighting against COVID-19,” he said. “It’s a fight for humanity. This issue of the West Philippine Sea is separate,” he said, using the Philippine name for the South China Sea. While the Philippines is pushing for China to remove its ships from the region, American navy ships have returned to the South China Sea. A U.S. aircraft carrier strike group entered the waterway on Sunday to carry out maritime strike exercises, anti-submarine operations, coordinated tactical training, and other activities, according to the U.S. Navy. It did not state when the exercises were to end. “It is great to be back in the South China Sea to reassure our allies and partners that we remain committed to freedom of the seas,” said the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group’s commander, Rear Adm. Doug Verissimo. The strike group includes the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, a guided-missile cruiser, and a destroyer squadron. Recent U.S. military maneuvers in the South China Sea have drawn criticism from Beijing. When the same strike group entered the South China Sea in January, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said “it does no good to regional peace and stability for the United States to frequently send military vessels and aircraft to the South China Sea to show off muscles,” BenarNews reported at the time. A month later, the strike group was joined by the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in carrying out dual-carrier operations in the South China Sea. Other countries have been conducting military maneuvers in the region as well. Canada sent the Halifax-class frigate HMCS Calgary through the South China Sea last week while sailing from Brunei to Vietnam, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported. Meanwhile a Vietnamese frigate conducted combat drills with an anti-submarine helicopter in the Spratly Islands, Vietnamese media reported on Tuesday while not releasing the date of the drills.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162950", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12802", "source": "scrapy"},

The board is a global qualification provider that offers international qualifications, which help students apply abroad for their higher education. The qualifications that are meant to jumpstart students’ careers are IGCSE (grade ten), AS (grade eleven), and A2 (grade twelve), also known as the the A Levels. I will be appearing for the exams in June at my school in Pune. Given the high incidence of cases in Maharashtra, and the fact that a majority of us have not been to school since March 2020, it is unfair for our fears to be disregarded. Cambridge has deemed it safe and fair for us to come to sit for an exam after what is now a year of online and unstable learning, and has left it to the discretion of the country in which the exam is to be administered. Other exam boards like Oxford AQA and Pearson Edexcel that offer the same qualifications have cancelled exams globally in view of the coronavirus pandemic. These boards have not opted for a bipartisan route like Cambridge, where certain countries will be graded on coursework, homework, and past papers, while the rest will be writing exams as normal. How are we to be compared fairly? If the basis of assessment is different, how is it fair that we’d be held to the same standards when competing for the same universities, scholarships, and financial aid packages? Not to mention that local boards (Maharashtra Board for me) have got syllabus cuts and modifications, but we’ve got nothing. We are not equipped to write the exams mentally, academically, or physically. It seems as if they don’t recognise the impact this past year has had on us. Rising cases in India, Maharashtra specifically, seem to be uncontrollable. We haven’t heard a peep from the Education Ministry or Cambridge International on how we are to move forward in this environment. It is not safe for anyone to be taking an exam right now. Competing with students who won’t be writing exams as we are is the epitome of disparity. There’s no other way to make this fair, they need to cancel the exams internationally. COBIS, the global organisation of British international schools also released a  , which shows that most schools worldwide don’t feel that exams are a fair way forward at present, but Cambridge International seems to be paying no heed. There is also the   from Ofqual, the regulating body of exams in the UK, which states that a majority of Cambridge International schools want Ofqual to prevent the moving forward of these exams internationally. A   petition makes the same plea, but has not been addressed yet. Cambridge’s updates are made public on their website every Friday but they are hardly so. Most of the time, the content is vague and non-coherent, much like the emails students receive from them whenever we have queries. Even though they do occasionally reply to students’ emails, their answers are never clear, precise, or transparent; most pass the buck to the Indian government. Cambridge says it is in direct contact with schools, but even if have sent any communication regarding exams to our schools, students do not receive anything personally. Phone calls and emails to the Education Ministry have always been a dead end. The one time that I did get a chance to speak to someone, they said they have no autonomy over these exams.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also written to the education minister to consider the demands of students for cancelling the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams. Vadra said that its 'shocking' that the CBSE has decided to go ahead with exams despite parents expressing fears and 'apprehensions' about assembling at exam centres in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. She said these 'apprehensions' are not 'Unreasonable', so exams should be cancelled. She, in her letter said, \"It will be practically impossible to ensure the safety of students at large and at crowded exam centres. Additionally, given the nature and the spread of the virus, it is not just the students who will be at risk but also their teachers, invigilators and family members who are in contact with them. Aside from this, by forcing the children to sit for these exams during a raging pandemic, the Government and the CBSE board will be held responsible in the event that any of the exam centres prove to be hotspots at which large numbers of children become infected with the disease.\" The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has also appealed to the Centre to take a uniform decision on the board exams of Classes 10 and 12 across the country in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A unilateral decision by any state would lead to students of that state being at a disadvantage in terms of career and opportunities, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said in a letter, dated April 10, addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. \"Your intervention would mean national consensus, instead of a unilateral decision by any particular state,\" Sawant said in his letter.

A few days later, the city was placed under a state-imposed lockdown, limiting the movement and daily lives of its 11 million citizens.  Amid the crisis, the Chinese authorities disrupted the flow of information to and from the city, which was cut off from the rest of the world until now. 61 days after the lockdown was imposed, authorities in Wuhan are making claims that the coronavirus pandemic in the city is buried, ie, that it has reached a zero transmission rate. Workers have been instructed to return to factories, businesses are attempting to reboot, and most travel bans have been lifted. Even though China claims that Wuhan has returned to normal, the country has kept mum about what happened in the city during the two-month long lockdown. Multiple reports and videos clearly showed Chinese authorities dragging citizens out of their homes for testing and containment. Additionally, there has been no acknowledgment of the intense control exercised by China over what information is shared with the world. Amid the global outcry against China for withholding initial information and prosecuting medical officials who tried to warn the world, China now claims that the city of Wuhan has recovered. However, the facts and voices from the ground have a different story to tell.   A video posted by Jennifer Zeng on Twitter claims that hospitals in the country are no longer accepting patients to display a zero-case record. Zeng is a prominent Chinese activist who has ardently recorded Beijing’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. With a state-initiated crackdown on independent reporting, China wants to display to the world their medical prowess. Just last week, China expelled American reporters based in the country. The officials have been attempting to plant conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the virus, one of which claimed that the virus was sent to the country by US army. For now, it’s hard to say what’s really happening in the country. As of figures from today, more than 380,000 cases have been registered worldwide. Additionally, over 16,500 have died.

Taiwan's military responded by scrambling planes to monitor the Chinese aircraft, issuing radio warnings and mobilizing air defense systems until the aircraft left the area, its ministry of defense said. Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu warned on Wednesday that the country would fight \"to the very last day,\" if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has never controlled Taiwan, were to invade. \"From my limited understanding of American decision makers watching developments in this region, they clearly see the danger of the possibility of China launching an attack against Taiwan,\" he told reporters. \"We are willing to defend ourselves without any questions and we will fight the war if we need to fight the war. And if we need to defend ourselves to the very last day we will defend ourselves to the very last day,\" Wu said. Meanwhile, the USS John S. McCain (DDG 56), an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, conducted \"a routine Taiwan Strait transit April 7 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law,\" the U.S. 7th Fleet said in a statement. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the move wasn't in response to \"specific events or actions,\" but rather to demonstrate its commitment to the freedom of all nations to \"sail, operate and fly in accordance with international law.\" China hit out at the United States for \"endangering the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.\" CCP leader Xi Jinping has told the country's military and armed police force to get 'combat ready' to defend national sovereignty and security, amid fears that Beijing may be planning an invasion of democratic Taiwan in the next few years. Gaining control over Taiwan has been highlighted as a core goal of Xi's \"national rejuvenation program\" by 2035, with some analysts saying Beijing will likely make its first move in the next few years. The top U.S. military commander in the region has warned that China could be preparing to bring forward plans to invade Taiwan as early as 2027. Admiral Philip Davidson, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Beijing could launch an invasion within the next six years. The PLA has flown multiple aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ since the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20. The ADIZ was created by the United States Armed Forces after World War II, and covers most of the Taiwan Strait, part of the East China Sea, and adjacent airspace. Not mentioned in or regulated by any international agreement, the zones extend far beyond territorial airspace and are designed to give a country more time to respond to potentially hostile aircraft. Taiwan's defense ministry said recent incursions have included bombers and fast-moving fighter jets usually used for offensive purposes. In 2018, the Pentagon warned that the PLA is gradually preparing for a possible invasion of Taiwan, as the CCP \"continued to develop and deploy increasingly advanced military capabilities intended to coerce Taiwan, signal Chinese resolve, and gradually improve capabilities for an invasion.\" Taiwan has never been ruled by Beijing nor formed part of the People's Republic of China, but has been locked out of international diplomacy and agencies at the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s insistence. Washington has said it will no longer seek to \"appease\" China on Taiwan, as the State Department announced an end to a ban on high-level official and diplomatic contact with Taiwanese officials on Jan. 9, at the tail end of the Trump administration. Under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, China has stepped up its rhetoric claiming the island as part of its territory, and has refused to rule out a military invasion. But Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly said that the country's 23 million people have no wish to give up their sovereignty or their democratic way of life.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162953", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12856", "source": "scrapy"},

However, it coincides with one of the biggest pandemics our societies have witnessed: the novel coronavirus COVID-19. As of figures from today, more than 380,000 cases have been registered worldwide. Additionally, over 16,500 have died. The global tally of the recovered patients so far stands at 100,000. Will the rise in temperatures across the globe mean a dip in the number of infected cases? Many Chinese experts claim that high temperature and humidity can significantly reduce the transmission of the virus. The research was undertaken at Beihang and Tsinghua University in China.   The focus of the study was 100 Chinese cities. The scientists realised that the transmission rate varied across cities with different weather conditions. They realised that as the weather became warmer and humid, the rate of transmission fell. For every degree of rise in temperatures (in Celsius), the rate of transmission fell by 0.0383 points. Similarly, for every one per cent increase in relative humidity, the transmission rate fell by 0.0224 points. Even though an important development, the rise in temperature is simply not enough to slow down the spread of the virus. As it turns out, heat weakens all kinds of viruses. The COVID-19 is capable of living on surfaces for many days.  During its initial period, countries that experience lower temperatures and humidity witnessed severe outbreaks. These include South Korea, Japan, and Iran. On the other hand, warmer countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand were able to contain it much quickly. Another study conducted at the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland took a different approach. The researchers mapped the outbreak in different regions and discovered that the most severe outbreaks happened in countries where the temperature ranged between five and 11 degree Celsius. The virus was found to be clustered in a narrow band of consistently similar weather conditions across the northern hemisphere. This zone included countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, Iran , Italy, France and the US Pacific Northwest. The study has also indicated that the coronavirus could be a seasonal respiratory virus. Both studies point out to the same verdict: the forthcoming summers could bring relief, but would it completely stop the virus? The answer remains no! Many doctors have warned of the virus resurfacing during autumn, and reiterate the importance of maintaining personal hygiene and practicing social distancing.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/02/12/128544-untitled-design-15.jpg?itok=ezHHXif8\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162953", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21824", "source": "scrapy"},

Earlier this month, Wuhan’s top party official came up with the idea of a “gratitude education programme”, centred around thanking Xi Jinping and The Communist Party for the efforts they have made to fight the coronavirus. “We must through various channels carry out gratitude education among the citizens of the whole city as well as cadres”, the official had told a local newspaper. The rationale behind this was to extend gratitude to Jinping and to the Communist Party. However, the public reaction to the idea was not very nice. People immediately slammed the idea of this programme, with a local journalist asking the party official to first “educate himself”. To avoid collateral damage, the Chinese authorities covered up the criticism and dropped the idea of the programme itself.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2018/09/11/15469-gettyimages-493919954-20161214052142.jpg?itok=18flu-N7\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162953", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21696", "source": "scrapy"},

For weeks, the Philippine government has engaged in a verbal tussle with Beijing and lodged diplomatic protests over the presence of dozens of Chinese ships in contested waters of the sea, but China has denied the allegations and said these are fishing vessels. “The U.S. admonition to China against the use of force on Philippine public vessels and aircraft, which are performing their constitutional mandate to protect and defend Philippine rights in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, is an additional affirmation of the long-standing partnership between our two countries,” said Arsenio Andolong, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of National Defense.  “As the situation in the West Philippine Sea evolves, we keep all our options open in managing the situation, including leveraging our partnerships with other nations such as the United States,” Andolong said, referring to the section of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines.  A day earlier, the U.S. State Department reiterated that Washington was backing its longtime Asian ally – a former American colony – in the ongoing dispute over the Chinese ships moored at Whitsun Reef, which lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and other disputed waters in the Spratly Islands. “As we have stated before, an armed attack against the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, will trigger our obligations under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty,” Ned Price, the department’s spokesman, told a daily press briefing in response to a reporter’s question. Under the auspices of the 70-year-old treaty, the armed forces of the United States and the Philippines will come to each other’s military aid in the event of an external attack on one of them.  Despite repeated calls by Manila for the ships to leave the area and the filing of diplomatic protests, the Chinese vessels have lingered there.  Last week, the Philippine military said dozens of Chinese militia ships were scattered among contested reefs and islets in the Philippine EEZ.  China’s foreign ministry has insisted the area around Whitsun Reef belongs to Beijing. “The Philippines attempts to use an illegal, null-and-void award to negate China’s sovereignty, rights and interests, negate Chinese fishermen’s fishing history and rights in their traditional fishing grounds,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a press briefing on Tuesday. “We hope the Philippines will look at this objectively and correctly, immediately stop wanton hype … and avoid casting negative influence on bilateral relations and the overall peace and stability in the South China Sea,” he said. The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond on Thursday to the Philippine and U.S. statements. Beijing insists much of the South China Sea is its territory, despite a July 2016 international arbitral ruling by a United Nations-backed tribunal that affirmed the Philippines’ EEZ. Other governments claiming parts of the South China Sea are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Although Indonesia does not consider itself a claimant in the territorial disputes, China claims historic rights that overlap with Indonesia’s EEZ.  Since Monday the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has filed daily protests against China about the ships in its EEZ. On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. again demanded that all the Chinese ships move out.  “Nobody fishes by lashing ships together. Last time that was done was the Persian invasion of Greece recorded by Herodotus,” Locsin said in a Twitter post late Wednesday. “We’ve seen that movie.” The Chinese presence in the Philippine EEZ also has Manila counting on its Visiting Forces Agreement with Washington, which President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to terminate. In February, Lloyd Austin, the defense chief in the new Biden Administration, reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to the 1999 VFA and the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty during his first official phone call with his Philippine counterpart, Delfin Lorenzana. The VFA, which allows the presence of U.S. troops in the Philippines, has remained in effect since Manila deferred its termination.  The pact is also the basis for another defense cooperation agreement, which allows U.S. troops to pre-position assets at certain Philippine military bases.  “We are continuously in talks with the U.S. on the matter of mutual defense,” Andolong said Thursday.  “Both parties are committed to undertake their obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty so that neither stands alone in these issues involving the two states’ inherent right of self-defense, individually and collectively,” he said.  The U.S., meanwhile, has maintained naval patrols in the South China Sea. On Sunday, the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group entered the waterway to carry out maritime strike exercises, anti-submarine operations, coordinated tactical training, and other activities, according to the U.S. Navy.  On Wednesday, the Royal Malaysian Air Force announced it had completed a two-day bilateral military exercise in the sea with the Roosevelt strike group.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"210408-PH-CH-US-defense-inside.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/philippine/210408-ph-ch-us-defense-inside.jpg\" title=\"210408-PH-CH-US-defense-inside.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162953", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13170", "source": "scrapy"},

Law, 27, tweeted earlier this week that he had been approved as a political asylum-seeker by the Home Office following a series of intervies over four months. The Hong Kong government said on Friday that it opposed the \"harboring of criminals\" by other countries, regions, organizations, or individuals. Apparently dispensing with Hong Kong's rule-of-law principle that the accused are presumed innocent until proven guilty, it said \"criminals [were alleging] that they were prosecuted for political reasons to deliberately escape justice.\" \"Any country, region, organisation or individual that harbours Hong Kong criminals in any form shows contempt for the rule of law, grossly disrespects Hong Kong's legal systems and barbarically interferes in the affairs of Hong Kong,\" it said, in comments closely resembling those made by a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing on Thursday.  \"They shall eventually bear the consequences of what they have done,\" it said. Beijing on Thursday accused the U.K. of \"harboring criminals\" after Law's asylum status was confirmed. \"The UK is clearly a platform for Hong Kong independence agitators, and provides so-called shelter for wanted criminals,\" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing in Beijing. \"The UK should immediately correct its mistake, and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs,\" Zhao said. Law said it was precisely the fact that he was wanted under the draconian national security law, that was imposed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Hong Kong from July 1, 2020, that led to his being considered at risk by the British government. \"The fact that I am wanted under the National Security Law shows that I am exposed to severe political persecution and am unlikely to return to Hong Kong without risk,\" Law wrote, citing the decision letter he received from the Home Office. He also called on the Home Office to consider accepting a broader range of evidence for Hong Kong applications. Amnesty International said the national security law had \"greatly restrict[ed] freedom of expression and other human rights in the city.\" \"The chilling effect of the NSL on Hong Kong civil society has been rapid and deeply disturbing,\" the report, issued by the Hong Kong branch of the London-based rights group, said. Two days after the law was passed, the Hong Kong government declared that the 2019 protest slogan 'Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!\" constituted an offense under clauses in the law banning pro-secessionist words and deeds, the report said. \"Individuals and businesses that had shown support for the 2019 protest movement deleted their social media posts and accounts for fear of retaliation from the authorities,\" it said. The law granted sweeping new investigatory powers to police, including the power to impose travel bans, to search people's homes, to freeze or seize their assets, and to place them under surveillance without a court order, the report said. Authorities in Hong Kong ruled on Friday that Tam Tak-chi, the detained vice chairman of the opposition party People Power, could be tried for sedition in the District Court, with no jury, despite arguments from his defense team that the court would have no jurisdiction in national security cases. Tam was arrested in September 2020 for using the protest slogans \"Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!\" and \"Five demands, not one less!\" while giving speeches on the streets of Kowloon between March and July.  Tam is also accused of shouting: \"Dirty cops, hope your family members all die!\" and of making complaints relating to police inaction during a July 21, 2019 mob attack on train passengers in Yuen Long, and to riot police attacks on passengers in Prince Edward MTR station on Aug. 31, 2019.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162954", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12529", "source": "scrapy"},

I have lived in Chauras, Srinagar Garhwal for most of my life, but forest fires have frequently been recurring only in the last few years. A couple of months back, around mid-October, I had reported the fire around my locality. The forest has been burning since, over and over again. People would normally assume that those living in the mountains are habituated with fire, but are we really? Having witnessed several forest fires, I can say that the fires this year are unusual, because we had less rain this season and the winter was extremely dry. The situation will get worse in peak summer months. This should be a wake up call – the Himalayas need saving. I am a wildlife researcher and for the past seven years, I have been working in the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttarakhand. During my research, I hadn’t witnessed a single forest fire but this year, this part of the state is also burning. Be it reserved forest land or community land, the state government has received reports on fires from everywhere. In a forest area a couple of minutes away from my home that I visited on 7 April, I could only see dry forest road covered with ash. The fire started near the human settlement and went up to the forest, having a drastic effect on the entire ecosystem and the condition of animals and plants. Moreover, the smoke here is toxic and harmful for human health. I have personally faced health issues because of prolonged smoke and decided to leave the town. People around my area are also reporting respiratory illness and burning in their eyes due to the smoke. Health consequences of the fires figure a lot in local conversations, but there is little attention paid to them. Besides environmental or natural reasons, there are two other reasons I can propose as a native here. First, accidental reasons, like people who throw small parties or have a bonfire inside the forest and leave the fire unattended, or it can be due to the burning of crops by villagers at the edge of the forest. These accidental reasons can be a cause for a one-time fire. However, the reasons for periodic fires must be investigated from a human angle. Most of the time there are people who intentionally start a fire for mental satisfaction. People here usually know there is one person responsible but villagers don’t want to disclose it. That person could even be a patient of pyromania, a disorder where the affected sets fire to things deliberately. Therefore, other than traditional reasons for a forest fire, we need to pay attention to deliberate fires to understand this deep down and remove it from the root. Though the government has additional penalties for miscreants now, people are not aware of it. I believe more awareness and strong punishment is an imperative need. While I have witnessed fires in a tiny part of the Himalayas, there are hundreds of fires in other parts of the state that are burning, and this is the saddest part – it could burn once again.

Pandey anchored the innings for the Sunrisers with a 44-ball 61* with a strike rate of 138, but the target needed for him to play a little bit quicker as it put too much pressure on the other batsmen to get going from the outset.

Tech experts say the move to bring the country more in step with the rest of the digital world is crucial, but will cause \"chaos\" in a rocky transition period. Myanmar is the   to embrace unicode that has significant numbers of people online. Without it, most users see international content -- and a lot from within the country -- as lines of meaningless symbols. Household name websites can be impossible to read while translation and voice recognition software do not work. October 1 is \"U-Day\", when Myanmar officially adopts the new system. From then on, all electronic communication from government offices, telecoms companies, banks and media must be in Unicode by law. Myanmar became a global code anomaly due to isolation under its former military junta. Microsoft and Apple helped other countries standardise years ago, but Western sanctions meant Myanmar lost out. IT pioneer Zaw Htut, 47, describes this as the final battle won in a decades-long code \"war\". \"This is like changing to democracy,\" he enthuses. However, making the switch to Unicode will be a turbulent ride, and he warned that initially there will be \"chaos\". Facebook -- the main social media platform in the country -- has developed automatic conversion software to give users a \"seamless experience\", says strategic response team member Sarah Oh. But many will suddenly be unable to read messages on other apps and from banks or phone operators, while those who switch will no longer be able to communicate with friends still using the old system. A homegrown rival to Unicode called \"Zawgyi\" (pronounced: zaw-jee) -- meaning wizard -- evolved in Myanmar's detached digital ecosystem. Its popularity exploded as the country opened up from 2011 and smartphone use soared. Today around 90 per cent of people use Zawgyi instead of Unicode. Incompatible without fiddly plug-ins, it only allows people to communicate in Burmese with other Zawgyi users, excluding the nation's minority languages. Its clunkiness also means search functions do not work, crippling data storage systems. According to tech experts, it could take years to achieve full migration. Zaw Htut compares the abrupt switch to Unicode with the former junta's overnight decision for   to drive on the right instead of the left. \"But we're digitally empowering the nation,\" he said. Joox, a regional version of Spotify, said it is impossible to convert the millions of Burmese language songs on its app. With the deadline looming, celebrities and influencers are hammering home the need to convert while technicians prepare for a deluge of queries. An army of volunteers are helping in online forums and offline at teashops. \"There's a lot of confusion,\" explains computer science student Tin Lat Nandar, 23, as she updates retirees' phones at a Sunday drop-in session. Yangon street vendor Mi Mi, 35, says she has heard about the switch but does not want to change.  \"I don't know how to do it\", she said. An estimated 10 to 15 per cent of mainly older phones will not be advanced enough to convert. Many cheaper, illegally imported devices even come pre-installed with the old system -- putting those too poor to buy newer models at a clear disadvantage. Still others are excited at the wealth of information now at their fingertips. \"I'll be able to read Wikipedia in Burmese,\" says a beaming Aung Kyaw Oo, 62, as he leaves a drop-in session.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/09/27/111489-untitled-design-9.jpg?itok=-0gRDYRB\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162954", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22190", "source": "scrapy"},

In today’s post-COVID-19 world, the visitor figures are about 60 per cent of monthly capacity. Some things have not changed, however; for instance, a number of people think it is acceptable not to shower before entering the pool, the programme   finds out in a series of vox pops. Others may even pee in the pool, thinking that chlorine is used to disinfect the water. The problem, however, is that urine and sweat contain ammonia, which reduces the effect that chlorine has on the water. So what is being done to keep the pools sufficiently clean to protect swimmers from bacteria and viruses, which can enter the water? And what is the principal reason why one should shower before swimming? Marchwood Laboratory Services technical manager Tan Thuan Piang, who has sampled Singapore’s pool waters with his team for over 15 years, noted that ammonia in pools, though mainly from sweat and urine, also comes from sunscreen lotion and cosmetics. While the amount of ammonia in Singapore’s pools is usually “minute” — low enough to escape detection — a possible reason for this is that ammonia “reacts very fast” with chlorine in the water to form the by-product chloramine, he said. When there is a “heavy chlorine smell”, it is usually tri-chloramine, a type of chloramine formed as the ammonia level rises and “not the chlorine we really want”, cited Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder. “It’s a nuisance,” said the professor, who has studied water quality and safety for more than 20 years. “As the chlorine forms chloramine, there’s less chlorine there. So we have to … add more chlorine to keep the level safe. “If we don’t practise good hygiene, the amount of chlorine in a swimming pool will drop quickly and make it less safe … The more hygiene we have, the less ammonia there’ll be and the cleaner the pools stay.” This is why he “always” advocates showering before entering the pool — to minimise the amount of chemicals it needs. Chloramine can also have a more direct effect on swimmers. National Skin Centre consultant dermatologist Lucinda Tan, who handles two to three patients a month for swimming-related conditions, said chloramines can “irritate and dry the skin” by stripping away the skin’s natural protective oil. “This allows dust, bacteria (and) allergens to enter and cause irritation. A normal person with normal skin … may get away with that,” she said. “You break a lot of the skin barrier, and you allow a lot of germs to enter, and then you can get bad infections,\" she added. “If your immune system is compromised … and (you have) a small cut and whatnot, you can still pick up an infection that can potentially worsen with time.” She noted that all exposed parts of the body, including the hair and eyes, can be affected. People may also end up with a dry and itchy throat if they swallow “a little bit more” pool water. And some children may be more susceptible to dry, irritating skin than adults. To maintain safety, there are national standards for the chlorine level in Singapore’s swimming pools: It must be between one to three parts per million. “Too little chlorine (and) it’d encourage algae to form. Too much chlorine (and) you’d feel the itch and discomfort on (your) skin,” said Jonas Su, operations director of pool maintenance company Anwill. Normally, at the end of a servicing, his team adds chlorine even if the pool passes muster, as the reading would drop. “By adding a little bit more, probably it’ll shoot up … still within the ideal range,” he said. “It’ll last for a few days before we come again.” Other parameters for testing pool cleanliness include the pH value, colour and turbidity (cloudiness) of the water. By regulation, the pH value — which shows the level of acidity or alkalinity — should be between 7.2 and 7.8. But when Talking Point submitted samples from 10 public pools — in Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bishan, Clementi, Jalan Besar, Jurong East, Kallang Basin, Queenstown, Tampines and Yishun — to Marchwood for testing, half of them were not within this range. “It’s not a concern,” said Marchwood’s Tan, who described the readings of 8.1 to 8.3 as “slightly higher”. “But any pH that’s above nine will cause some skin irritation.” Marchwood also tested the samples for faecal bacteria, namely E. coli and the coliform count. By the National Environment Agency’s standards, there should not be more than 200 bacteria per millilitre of water. And all the samples met this standard as well as the other test parameters. Besides adding chlorine to pools, the cleaning process includes scooping up debris and vacuuming the bottom of the pools. This can be a laborious task. What swimmers can do for personal hygiene on their part is relatively simple, however, like having a quick rinse before entering the pool to get rid of dirt, as well as applying moisturiser and sunblock if needed. Although moisturisers would contribute to the formation of chloramine, Tan the dermatologist said their use would help buffer the effects of chlorine or chloramine on skin. There are “two broad groups” of moisturisers: One has the “building blocks” of skin to repair the skin; the other acts as a protective barrier. “So it depends on a patient’s preference and the skin conditions,” she said. “Generally, you’d want something slightly oilier because you want the moisturiser to last for the duration of the swim … The ones that are more water-resistant would help as well.\" She also recommended having a rinse immediately after leaving the pool to “get rid of all the chlorine”. She added: “If possible, use a gentle cleanser (for) a more complete removal.” For extra assurance, swimmers can even get a test strip online that shows the pH and chlorine levels of the water on the spot.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162949", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47538", "source": "scrapy"},

She was 59. After fighting Covid-19, she had tested negative for it five days ago. However, her condition worsened and she was taken to hospital again. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Abdul Hamid expressed grief and sent heartfelt condolences to Mita Huq's family. \"We will remember her role in popularising Rabindra Sangeet among the masses\", said the President in his message. She was taken to Chhayanaut Sangeet Bidyayatan at 11:00am yesterday for her colleagues and well-wishers to pay their last respects. She was buried next to her father at Keraniganj's Boromonoharia. \"I am shocked,\" said eminent Rabindra Sangeet exponent, Rezwana Chowdhury Bannya. \"This is an irrevocable loss for Rabindra Sangeet. We always kept in touch and her premature demise really hurts me. May she rest in peace.\" Sadi Mohammad, one of the most revered Rabindra Sangeet artistes in the country, said that he saw Mita as his younger sister. \"I have done so many shows with her both at home and abroad… She would visit me whenever she felt better and would be really happy whenever we visited her. I would often cook and take food for her. My heart is filled with sorrow now.\" Renowned Nazrul Sangeet artiste Sujit Mustafa also shared his grief. \"She was a rare talent -- a top tier artiste. There are many singers who can sing commercially today but very few have the calibre of Mita Huq. She wanted to get well and return to music. Unfortunately, this will not happen anymore.\" \"I am at a loss,\" said National Award winning singer-composer Bappa Mazumder. \"It is difficult to accept that Mita di left us.\" Famed classical exponent and guru Asit Dey considers Mita Huq to be an example for the next generation to follow. \"She was an artiste's artiste -- a role model. I have never seen her without a smile on her face. She used to come to our classical music ashor and would listen to music all night, such was her love towards music.\" Noted actor Runa Khan said, \"I lost someone so dear to me. This void is never to be filled. I just pray that she found peace in her passing.\" Her passing is indeed a huge loss to Rabindra Sangeet. The artiste, who had carved her own niche in the art, was unique in her presentation. In both West Bengal and Bangladesh, she was seen as a pioneer with a inimitable style, never likening herself to anyone else's pattern. Born into a musical family, the noted artiste received her training from maestros such as the late Wahidul Huq, Sanjida Khatun and Ustad Mohammad Hossain Khan. She was a regular performer in the Bangladesh TV and radio since 1977. She participated in the Berlin International Youth Festival in 1974, and since then, travelled all over the world for performances. The singer rose to prominence in the 90's with her first album \"Amar Mon Mane Na\". With her mellifluous voice, she won over the hearts of all Bangladeshi listeners. She voiced over 200 albums throughout her illustrious career. Mita Huq was also the founder director and teacher of the Music Training and Performance Group -- Surtirtha -- and served as the head of the department of Rabindra Sangeet at Chhayanaut Institute in Dhaka. She was also the former general secretary and incumbent vice-president of the Rabindra Sangeet Shommelon Parishad. In 2017, she and writer Hayat Mamud received the Rabindra Puraskar from Bangla Academy. The legendary artiste was awarded the coveted Ekushey Padak in 2020 for her contributions to music. She was outspoken about the divisiveness, moral corruption and violence in a world where Tagore had spoken of unconditional peace and urged everyone to be kinder to one another. For the last five years,  Mita Huq had been battling various kidney-related diseases and underwent dialysis. The singer was married to actor-director Khaled Khan, who passed away in December 2013. Farhin Khan Joyita, a renowned singer, is their only daughter.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-6\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/2021/04/12/mita-hoq.jpg?itok=VVLFzJDX&amp;c=29223f11a4d920b900224e2d6bfdfc69\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162949", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "18212", "source": "scrapy"},

Authorities in the central Chinese province of Hunan are believed to have secretly tried and jailed three non-governmental organization (NGO) workers, Cheng Yuan, Liu Dazhi, and Wuge Jianxiong, for \"subversion of state power\" in September after holding them incommunicado for nearly 18 months. Cheng's wife Shi Minglei arrived in the U.S. with the couple's daughter on April 7, with the help of the Christian rights group ChinaAid.  Shortly after landing, Shi tweeted: \"Cheng Yuan's wife and daughter are free!\" \"Easter has just ended, and we have said goodbye to darkness ... and brought me and our five-year-old daughter to freedom, with the help of ChinaAid,\" she wrote. Shi told RFA after her arrival that she still has no documentation to show that Cheng and the others have indeed been tried or sentenced. \"They acted illegally at every stage of the case,\" she said. \"From the persecution of the family members following Cheng's arrest, to the later stages when the case had been sent to court.\" \"That has to be the reason that the authorities haven't made any details of the case public so far.\" The three defendants have been denied meetings with attorneys hired by their families since being detained on July 22, 2019. The lawyers were told in March 2020 that the defenders had \"dismissed\" them and that the government had assigned them government-funded lawyers. But the families said they believe that the lawyers were fired under duress, and said they have had no contact with the government-appointed lawyers. For now, Shi said she was relieved to be beyond the reach of the state security police. \"It wasn't easy for us to get to the United States,\" she said. \"I am very grateful that my daughter is now free, and that we can't be used as hostages, or as a way to threaten Cheng Yuan.\" Changsha Funeng co-founder Yang Zhanqing, who now lives in the U.S., said the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) often uses political cases involving public dissent or rights activism to make an example of its critics. The fact that they are not doing that in this case suggests that even the authorities can't believe in the charges against the Changsha Three. \"I'm guessing there is no evidence at all, and no legal basis at all [for bringing this case],\" Yang told RFA. \"It's purely a form of official retaliation.\" Yang had earlier said that the three men were targeted because their rights work had received overseas funding, which the ruling Chinese Communist Party regards as \"collusion with hostile foreign forces,\" and a threat to its national security.

Koshyari was scheduled to travel by a state government aircraft to Dehradun, but the permission to use the plane was not granted even as the governor had boarded the aircraft, sources said.   The governor later took a commercial flight to travel to the capital of his home state of Uttarakhand, a statement from the Raj Bhavan said. The Raj Bhavan secretariat and the state government sought to blame each other for the incident, which added a new chapter in the uneasy ties between the ruling coalition, comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP, Congress, and the governor. The Raj Bhavan statement said the governor's secretariat had written to the government authorities seeking permission for the use of the aircraft \"well in advance\" on February 2. The office of the chief minister was also informed about it, the statement said. However, the Maharashtra government said the Raj Bhavan secretariat had been informed a day earlier bythe Chief Minister's Office (CMO) that approval for use of the official aircraft has not been given.   A statement from the CMO said the state government had taken serious cognisance that the official concerned at Raj Bhavan did not apprise the governor about the communication from the government (denying nod to use the aircraft). \"The Raj Bhavan official did not confirm about the approval for use of official plane and plan the Governor's travel schedule. \"The Chief Minister has issued directives that responsibility be fixed on the Raj Bhavan official concerned after taking serious cognisance of the developments,\" the CMO statement said. It said the Raj Bhavan secretariat should have confirmed about availability of the official plane since non- approval for same was communicated a day earlier.   \"Due to this the Governor had to face inconvenience. The state government is not to be blamed ,\" the CMO said. It admitted that the Raj Bhavan secretariat had sought permission for use of the official plane. \"On February 10, the CMO communicated that no permission was given for use of the plane. The Raj Bhavan secretariat was expected to check on the permission and then bring the governor to the airport,\" the CMO statement said. According to the Raj Bhavan statement, Koshyari is scheduled to preside over valedictory function of the 122nd Induction Training Programme of IAS officers at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration at Mussoorie in Uttarakhand on Friday.   He was scheduled to depart from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai for Dehradun at 10 am on Thursday, the statement said. Koshyari will travel to Mussoorie from Dehradun. \"Today, on 11th February 2021, the Honble Governor reached the CSIM Airport at 1000 hrs and boarded the government plane. However, the Honble Governor was informed that the permission for the use of Government Aircraft had not been received,\" the statement said. As directed by the governor, tickets for Dehradun were booked for the governor on a commercial aircraft leaving Mumbai at 12.15 pm immediately and accordingly, he left for Dehradun, it said.   While the Shiv Sena said the government had followed all laid-down norms in disallowing the governor to use the state-owned plane, the opposition BJP demanded an apology from the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) over the incident. The BJP accused the MVA government of being \"egoistic\" and indulging in \"childish acts\". Earlier, a source told PTI, \"Normally, governors do not wait for the permission to come. He sat in the aircraft. The pilot then said the permission was not given yet.\" When asked about the incident, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said he had no clue. \"I will take details on reaching the Mantralaya (state secretariat) and only then will be able to say anything,\" the deputy chief minister said.   Meanwhile, former Maharashtra minister and senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said the MVA government should apologise for \"insulting\" the governor. If the state government has purposefully denied permission, it is a \"blot\" on the state's reputation, he said. \"If this embarrassment is not intentional, then the state government should suspend the official who failed to issue the flying permission in time to the governor,\" he said. The government should apologise and avoid further escalation of the issue, Mungantiwar said. BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis accused the state government of being \"egoistic\" and indulging in \"childish acts\".   He also alleged that the state government has insulted the constitutional post of governor. \"It is an unfortunate incident. Such an incident had never happened in the state earlier. Governor is not a person, it is a designation. People come and go, but the designation stays,\" he said. The governor is the head of the state. In fact, it is the governor who appoints the chief minister and his cabinet, Fadnavis pointed out. \"The government should understand that it is insulting a constitutional post,\" he said. Defending the government, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said it had followed all norms in disallowing Koshyari to use the state plane for his visit to Dehradun.   Rejecting the BJP's charge that the government has insulted the governor, Raut told reporters in Delhi that there was no politics involved in the incident. \"We respect the governor. The government has upheld the Constitution...This is what I gather from my conversation with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray,\" he said. \"If the governor wants to use the government plane for private work, then there are some rules and had the government violated those rules, it would have been in the dock,\" the Sena MP said. Notably, state Congress chief Nana Patole on Wednesday said the MVA government has decided to move court over the 'delay' by the governor in the appointment of nominated members to the Legislative Council.   The state government recommended 12 names for appointment to the Council under the governor's quota to Koshyari in the first week of November last year. In October last year, during the coronavirus lockdown, Koshyari wrote a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, asking if the latter had turned \"secular\" since he denied permission at that time to reopen temples in the state. The CM later said he does need a \"Hindutva certificate\" from anyone. During the pandemic last year, Koshyari also insisted on holding the final year exams of degree students in the state, but Thackeray at that time rejected the demand.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162955", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18038", "source": "scrapy"},

Activists are determined to overshadow  , using the anniversary to step up their nearly four months of protests pushing for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability. Thousands marched through the streets of Hong Kong island on Tuesday afternoon, despite authorities rejecting an application to hold a rally there as police warned people \"to leave the scene as soon as possible\". Smaller crowds rallied in a number of other districts with clashes quickly breaking out. In Tsuen Wan, masked protesters used umbrellas and sticks to beat riot officers after they made a series of arrests. The officers retreated into a nearby town hall after they came under a barrage of projectiles. In Wong Tai Sin, police fired brief volleys of tear gas against protesters who had blocked nearby roads. The biggest march remained on Hong Kong island, a frequent battlefield between police and protesters where multiple malls and shops remained shuttered for the public holiday. \"Three months on and our five demands have yet to be achieved. We need to continue our fight,\" a protester, wearing a mask from the cult film and comic book \"V for Vendetta\", said. The protests came as lavish celebrations were taking place in Beijing, including a huge military parade through Tiananmen Square under the gaze of China's strongman President Xi Jinping. Among those watching the parade was Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who has historically low approval ratings at home as public anger boils over Beijing's increased control of the semi-autonomous city. Millions have hit the streets in record-breaking numbers while hardcore activists have repeatedly clashed with police, in the biggest challenge to China's rule since the city's 1997 handover by Britain. In a vivid illustration of the political insecurity now coursing through Hong Kong, city officials watched a morning harbourside flag-raising ceremony from the safety of the nearby convention centre. Since the 1997 handover, officials had always attended the ceremony outside, even during torrential downpours. But popular protests that erupted in June have made it increasingly risky for officials to appear in public. A flag-raising ceremony on July 1 -- the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover -- was also watched from indoors as protesters flooded the streets and later laid siege to the city's legislature. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung delivered an address in which he praised China's development over the last 70 years. But he said officials recognised they needed \"new thinking to try to address deep-rooted problems\" in Hong Kong. Throughout the morning police ramped up security checks and conducted frequent stop and searches while authorities announced the closure of a dozen subway stations. But the measures did little to halt crowds appearing in the afternoon. Rival pro-China rallies were also held. In the morning, a crowd of some 50 people waved flags and chanted \"Long live the motherland!\" \"We are Chinese and the whole nation is celebrating,\" Kitty Chan, 30, told AFP. Hong Kong's protests were initially sparked by a now scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland but have since snowballed into a much wider movement of popular anger against city leaders and Beijing.  Among the demands made by protesters is an inquiry into the police, an amnesty for the more than 1,500 people arrested and universal suffrage -- all of which have been rejected by Beijing and Lam.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/01/111854-untitled-design-7.jpg?itok=C87MYAci\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163000", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22154", "source": "scrapy"},

In today’s post-COVID-19 world, the visitor figures are about 60 per cent of monthly capacity. Some things have not changed, however; for instance, a number of people think it is acceptable not to shower before entering the pool, the programme   finds out in a series of vox pops. Others may even pee in the pool, thinking that chlorine is used to disinfect the water. The problem, however, is that urine and sweat contain ammonia, which reduces the effect that chlorine has on the water. So what is being done to keep the pools sufficiently clean to protect swimmers from bacteria and viruses, which can enter the water? And what is the principal reason why one should shower before swimming? Marchwood Laboratory Services technical manager Tan Thuan Piang, who has sampled Singapore’s pool waters with his team for over 15 years, noted that ammonia in pools, though mainly from sweat and urine, also comes from sunscreen lotion and cosmetics. While the amount of ammonia in Singapore’s pools is usually “minute” — low enough to escape detection — a possible reason for this is that ammonia “reacts very fast” with chlorine in the water to form the by-product chloramine, he said. When there is a “heavy chlorine smell”, it is usually tri-chloramine, a type of chloramine formed as the ammonia level rises and “not the chlorine we really want”, cited Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder. “It’s a nuisance,” said the professor, who has studied water quality and safety for more than 20 years. “As the chlorine forms chloramine, there’s less chlorine there. So we have to … add more chlorine to keep the level safe. “If we don’t practise good hygiene, the amount of chlorine in a swimming pool will drop quickly and make it less safe … The more hygiene we have, the less ammonia there’ll be and the cleaner the pools stay.” This is why he “always” advocates showering before entering the pool — to minimise the amount of chemicals it needs. Chloramine can also have a more direct effect on swimmers. National Skin Centre consultant dermatologist Lucinda Tan, who handles two to three patients a month for swimming-related conditions, said chloramines can “irritate and dry the skin” by stripping away the skin’s natural protective oil. “This allows dust, bacteria (and) allergens to enter and cause irritation. A normal person with normal skin … may get away with that,” she said. “You break a lot of the skin barrier, and you allow a lot of germs to enter, and then you can get bad infections,\" she added. “If your immune system is compromised … and (you have) a small cut and whatnot, you can still pick up an infection that can potentially worsen with time.” She noted that all exposed parts of the body, including the hair and eyes, can be affected. People may also end up with a dry and itchy throat if they swallow “a little bit more” pool water. And some children may be more susceptible to dry, irritating skin than adults. To maintain safety, there are national standards for the chlorine level in Singapore’s swimming pools: It must be between one to three parts per million. “Too little chlorine (and) it’d encourage algae to form. Too much chlorine (and) you’d feel the itch and discomfort on (your) skin,” said Jonas Su, operations director of pool maintenance company Anwill. Normally, at the end of a servicing, his team adds chlorine even if the pool passes muster, as the reading would drop. “By adding a little bit more, probably it’ll shoot up … still within the ideal range,” he said. “It’ll last for a few days before we come again.” Other parameters for testing pool cleanliness include the pH value, colour and turbidity (cloudiness) of the water. By regulation, the pH value — which shows the level of acidity or alkalinity — should be between 7.2 and 7.8. But when Talking Point submitted samples from 10 public pools — in Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bishan, Clementi, Jalan Besar, Jurong East, Kallang Basin, Queenstown, Tampines and Yishun — to Marchwood for testing, half of them were not within this range. “It’s not a concern,” said Marchwood’s Tan, who described the readings of 8.1 to 8.3 as “slightly higher”. “But any pH that’s above nine will cause some skin irritation.” Marchwood also tested the samples for faecal bacteria, namely E. coli and the coliform count. By the National Environment Agency’s standards, there should not be more than 200 bacteria per millilitre of water. And all the samples met this standard as well as the other test parameters. Besides adding chlorine to pools, the cleaning process includes scooping up debris and vacuuming the bottom of the pools. This can be a laborious task. What swimmers can do for personal hygiene on their part is relatively simple, however, like having a quick rinse before entering the pool to get rid of dirt, as well as applying moisturiser and sunblock if needed. Although moisturisers would contribute to the formation of chloramine, Tan the dermatologist said their use would help buffer the effects of chlorine or chloramine on skin. There are “two broad groups” of moisturisers: One has the “building blocks” of skin to repair the skin; the other acts as a protective barrier. “So it depends on a patient’s preference and the skin conditions,” she said. “Generally, you’d want something slightly oilier because you want the moisturiser to last for the duration of the swim … The ones that are more water-resistant would help as well.\" She also recommended having a rinse immediately after leaving the pool to “get rid of all the chlorine”. She added: “If possible, use a gentle cleanser (for) a more complete removal.” For extra assurance, swimmers can even get a test strip online that shows the pH and chlorine levels of the water on the spot.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162955", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47538", "source": "scrapy"},

The board is a global qualification provider that offers international qualifications, which help students apply abroad for their higher education. The qualifications that are meant to jumpstart students’ careers are IGCSE (grade ten), AS (grade eleven), and A2 (grade twelve), also known as the the A Levels. I will be appearing for the exams in June at my school in Pune. Given the high incidence of cases in Maharashtra, and the fact that a majority of us have not been to school since March 2020, it is unfair for our fears to be disregarded. Cambridge has deemed it safe and fair for us to come to sit for an exam after what is now a year of online and unstable learning, and has left it to the discretion of the country in which the exam is to be administered. Other exam boards like Oxford AQA and Pearson Edexcel that offer the same qualifications have cancelled exams globally in view of the coronavirus pandemic. These boards have not opted for a bipartisan route like Cambridge, where certain countries will be graded on coursework, homework, and past papers, while the rest will be writing exams as normal. How are we to be compared fairly? If the basis of assessment is different, how is it fair that we’d be held to the same standards when competing for the same universities, scholarships, and financial aid packages? Not to mention that local boards (Maharashtra Board for me) have got syllabus cuts and modifications, but we’ve got nothing. We are not equipped to write the exams mentally, academically, or physically. It seems as if they don’t recognise the impact this past year has had on us. Rising cases in India, Maharashtra specifically, seem to be uncontrollable. We haven’t heard a peep from the Education Ministry or Cambridge International on how we are to move forward in this environment. It is not safe for anyone to be taking an exam right now. Competing with students who won’t be writing exams as we are is the epitome of disparity. There’s no other way to make this fair, they need to cancel the exams internationally. COBIS, the global organisation of British international schools also released a  , which shows that most schools worldwide don’t feel that exams are a fair way forward at present, but Cambridge International seems to be paying no heed. There is also the   from Ofqual, the regulating body of exams in the UK, which states that a majority of Cambridge International schools want Ofqual to prevent the moving forward of these exams internationally. A   petition makes the same plea, but has not been addressed yet. Cambridge’s updates are made public on their website every Friday but they are hardly so. Most of the time, the content is vague and non-coherent, much like the emails students receive from them whenever we have queries. Even though they do occasionally reply to students’ emails, their answers are never clear, precise, or transparent; most pass the buck to the Indian government. Cambridge says it is in direct contact with schools, but even if have sent any communication regarding exams to our schools, students do not receive anything personally. Phone calls and emails to the Education Ministry have always been a dead end. The one time that I did get a chance to speak to someone, they said they have no autonomy over these exams.

Days later, on April 10, 1971 the US team became the first Americans to step foot in China for nearly a quarter of a century when they were invited to play friendly matches in the country. The thaw saw President Richard Nixon visit China in February 1972, and a Chinese table tennis squad visit the US. In 1979 formal relations were established between the two countries. Yao Zhenxu played Cowan, who died in 2004, during the Americans' ground-breaking trip. Yao still remembers the score, he won 21-12, 21-14, and says that Cowan thanked him afterwards for \"a serious game\". The American team were vastly inferior to the Chinese, so the hosts sometimes let their visitors win points in the spirit of sportsmanship and goodwill. Now 74, Yao says that it was only afterwards that he realised that he had played a part in something historic. \"Because of ping-pong diplomacy we changed the world order, and the people of China and the United States started friendly exchanges,\" he said. Yao appeared alongside Zhang in Shanghai on Saturday to mark 50 years of ping-pong diplomacy, with the city authorities hosting an event with speeches and friendly amateur matches. But the anniversary comes at a time when relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated markedly over a number of issues, notably trade, the fate of China's Uyghur minority and a clampdown in Hong Kong. In a recorded speech to mark the 50th anniversary, China's ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, accused some in the US of \"ideological bias and zero-sum thinking\". But he and Chinese state media took a largely positive tone, with Xinhua news agency hailing ping-pong diplomacy's \"wonderful legacy\". Yao and Zhang hope that the spirit of 1971 can help shape future relations between the world's top two economies for the better. \"Everyone knows that the relationship between China and the United States is a bit tense nowadays,\" said Yao. \"We hope that we can agree to disagree and keep friendly relations. \"Don't be afraid of competition, we can compete peacefully.\"", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-very-big-1\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/feature/images/2021/04/12/ice.jpg?itok=8GH7YHYw\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17806", "source": "scrapy"},

The WHO has also sought a meeting with the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to discuss the matter, they said. The move comes even as India's drug regulator has extended Covishield's shelf life from six to nine months from its manufacturing date. In a recent communique to Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the WHO has also asked the firm to formulate the doses with enough titer and/or implement a higher specification at release so that the minimum specification of= 2.5 x108ifu/dose is fulfilled throughout the shelf life. Shelf life is the length of time for which an item remains fit for use. The DCGI in a letter to SII in February said it has no objection in respect of 'extension of shelf life of Covishield vaccine' in a multi-dose glass vial (10 dose-5ml) from six months to nine months. \"You are permitted to apply the shelf life of nine months to unlabelled vials available on hand, subject to the condition that the details of such stock, batch-wise, shall be submitted to this office and Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli,\" DCGI Dr V G Somani had said in the letter. The DCGI's decision will help health authorities in reducing vaccine wastage. According to an update by the UK drug regulator dated February 22, the shelf-life of the AstraZeneca   vaccine is six months. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the vaccine as the European Union's health agency concluded a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and rare blood clots but stressed that the benefits of the vaccine to protect against   continue to outweigh the risks. The UK's medicines regulator on Wednesday said that under-30s in the country will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to \"evolving evidence\" linking it to rare blood clots.

He was 93. Clark, whose father, Tom Clark, was attorney general and U.S. Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his Manhattan home, a family member, Sharon Welch, announced to media outlets   After serving in President Lyndon Johnson’s Cabinet in 1967 and ’68, Clark set up a private law practice in New York in which he championed civil rights, fought racism and the death penalty, and represented declared foes of the United States including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. “If you don’t insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others?” he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedy’s Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever — Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Truman’s attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty  , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clark’s client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers. There were usually two to three dozen active cases on Clark’s legal calendar, and about 100 more in the background.

Then-27-year-old Chantel Giacalone went into anaphylactic shock after biting into a pretzel infused with peanut butter while in Las Vegas for a convention, the Las Vegas Review-Journal  Friday. Giacalone, an aspiring actor, had roles in “The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations” and the web series “Hollow Walls.” Giacalone’s lawyer, Christian Morris, said she lost oxygen to her brain for a period of minutes after seeking treatment from MedicWest Ambulance, which was running the medic station that day. Morris argued in a civil lawsuit that MedicWest Ambulance negligently treated her allergic reaction. He argued that neither of the two medics on-site that day had IV epinephrine, an adrenaline treatment for severe allergic reactions that is required by the Southern Nevada Health District. According to testimony during a three-week trial, the requirement was established by a task force the company sits on. Morris said the medics instead deployed intramuscular epinephrine, but IVs are required for full anaphylaxis. He argued the cost of the drug was only $2.42. The lawsuit was seeking more than $60 million in damages for medical expenses and emotional suffering. MedicWest denied any wrongdoing and said the outcome was inevitable because of Giacalone’s heightened sensitivity to peanuts. Attorney William Drury argued Giacalone never lost consciousness. “At least my daughter will be taken care of. I’m happy about that,” father Jack Giacalone said after the verdict was read on Friday. “All the anguish that we’ve been through for the last eight years, I’m not happy about. I just hope MedicWest changes their ways.” Jack Giacalone and his wife provide 24-hour care to their quadriplegic daughter, who has to be fed through a tube and can only communicate with her eyes, according to the Review-Journal.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "57513", "source": "scrapy"},

She says there was no widespread fraud and that her own party is attacking her for refusing to “put my thumb on the scale of democracy.” Barbara Cegavske, the only Republican statewide office holder in Nevada, said members of her party are disappointed with the election results and believe fraud occurred “despite a complete lack of evidence to support that belief.” Cegavske, who has overseen elections in the state since 2014, has repeatedly defended the results as reliable and accurate despite attacks from   and other Republicans. Nevada is among the states where former President Trump sought to subvert results from the   and conspiracy theories. President Joe Biden defeated Trump in the Western swing state by 2 percentage points, or nearly 34,000 votes. “Regrettably, members of my own political party have decided to censure me simply because they are disappointed with the outcome of the 2020 election. While I have been loyal to the Nevada Republican Party during my over two decades as an elected official, I have been unwavering in my commitment to oversee elections and administer Nevada’s election laws in a neutral, nonpartisan manner,” Cegavske said in a statement Sunday. “My job is to carry out the duties of my office as enacted by the Nevada Legislature, not carry water for the state GOP or put my thumb on the scale of democracy. Unfortunately, members of my own party continue to believe the 2020 general election was wrought with fraud — and that somehow I had a part in it — despite a complete lack of evidence to support that belief.” A GOP official who was unauthorized to speak publicly confirmed to The Associated Press that the measure passed on a 126-112 vote by the party’s governing members at a meeting in the state capital, Carson City. Jessica Hanson, the executive director of the state GOP, sent a statement from the party noting that the censure vote on Saturday “passed narrowly” and said it occurred following “a healthy debate” over the election. “The Nevada Republican Party holds our elected officials to a high standard. As such, this weekend the party sent a clear message that our officials must work for the people and we demand that our representatives at all levels of government uphold their Oath of Office,” the party said. It wasn’t clear from a copy of the censure resolution what punishment the censure entailed. Hanson did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the punishment. In March, Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald presented four boxes to Cegavske’s office that he and other Republican leaders said contained proof of more than 120,000 instances of voter fraud. But Cegavske   Election Integrity Violation reports submitted. Her office said a number of those reports were already under investigation by her office and it was reviewing the others reports to determine if an investigation was warranted. The secretary of state allows people to fill out the two-page Election Integrity Violation forms when they believe they have witnessed people breaking election laws, which staff subsequently investigate.

Five people died on Friday, and another six the next day, after police shot at demonstrators in several major districts across the Muslim-majority nation of 168 million people.   The protesters -- mostly from the hardline Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam -- were angry at the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Bangladesh marked 50 years of independence, accusing him of stoking communal violence against Muslims in his country. At one new protest in Narayanganj just outside the capital Dhaka, Hefazat supporters chanted \"action, action, direct action\" as they blocked the key highway linking Dhaka with the port city of Chittagong. Hundreds of demonstrators burnt furniture and tyres on the roads as they chanted anti-Modi slogans and called on authorities to investigate the shootings. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets after the protesters barricaded parts of the highway. A police spokesman told AFP they had since left the road.   Prothom Alo, the country's biggest Bengali-language daily, said at least 15 people were injured in the Narayanganj clashes.

Protests were also held in the northeastern city of Sylhet, the eastern district of Brahmanbaria and in Bosila, a Dhaka suburb, but there were no reports of violence, local media reported.   As Bangladesh celebrated independence, human rights groups criticised the government for what they described as growing authoritarianism, including forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.

Under-60s can still decide to take the vaccine but only following \"consultation with the doctor carrying out the vaccination ... and with an individual risk analysis,\" said ministers of Germany's 16 states as well as the federal health minister in a policy statement.   The World Health Organization and the EU's health watchdog have both deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine safe, but several countries have restricted its use over clotting fears. Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that experts have recorded in recent weeks \"very rare but very serious cases of thrombosis\" in people vaccinated with AstraZeneca. \"They are findings that (Germany's vaccine commission) and finally us, cannot ignore,\" she said. Germany's vaccine commission known as STIKO earlier Tuesday recommended that use of the jabs be halted for under-60s because of \"currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects\" in younger vaccinated people.   It intends to make another recommendation by the end of April on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received a first dose of the vaccine, it said. Pending this decision, ministers said people who are due for their second jab can either choose to take it if cleared by their attending doctor, or they can opt to wait for the commission to make its recommendation. The latest restrictions amounted to a new setback for the vaccine developed by the Anglo-Swedish laboratory. Nevertheless Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany would be able to meet its goal of offering every adult a coronavirus jab by the end of the summer.   Just after it received approval from European regulator EMA for use in the bloc, Germany restricted the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s because of insufficient data. After clearing it for older people subsequently, Germany along with several EU nations suspended its use again in mid-March because of clotting fears. Just over a week after allowing its use again, German authorities have now again halted its use among younger people. Merkel insisted however that it is such careful consideration and transparency that can keep the public's confidence in the vaccine. \"Trust stems from the knowledge that every suspicion, every individual case will be examined,\" she said.   The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people. Germany's medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday. Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week. On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s \"pending further analysis\". The AstraZeneca vaccine has had something of a rollercoaster ride.   Britain, which developed it, staunchly supports its use, South Africa has rejected it outright.

He was 93. Clark, whose father, Tom Clark, was attorney general and U.S. Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his Manhattan home, a family member, Sharon Welch, announced to media outlets   After serving in President Lyndon Johnson’s Cabinet in 1967 and ’68, Clark set up a private law practice in New York in which he championed civil rights, fought racism and the death penalty, and represented declared foes of the United States including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. “If you don’t insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others?” he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedy’s Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever — Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Truman’s attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty  , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clark’s client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers. There were usually two to three dozen active cases on Clark’s legal calendar, and about 100 more in the background.

Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed.\"", "text": "Brandon Bernard called and emailed me daily in the two months before his execution. We spoke a few hours before he was executed and some of our last words were spent discussing his last words. For the first time, his optimism was gone. Even the day before, he sounded hopeful because he had heard that the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney  .  Brandon read his speech to the Pardon Office to me before presenting it, and the profound level of remorse he expressed brought me to tears. He was a different person from the teenager arrested over 20 years earlier. Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed. I began writing to death row prisoners after reading Bryan Stevenson’s book   about an innocent man condemned to death row. Books often change my course; I read   a few years ago and haven’t eaten meat since. After reading “Just Mercy,” I sent out postcards to about a dozen death row inmates across the U.S. When I started what my husband, family and friends universally consider an odd hobby, I had no idea how gratifying and life-altering writing death row prisoners would become.   When we first began exchanging letters a year ago, I warned Brandon that I had one other pen pal at Terre Haute federal penitentiary. In my experience, inmates do not want to write someone with multiple pen pals at the same facility out of legitimate concerns over privacy and safety. Brandon’s immediate response was, “Well, then that makes me one of the two luckiest men at Terre Haute.” To call himself lucky after over   23 hours a day in a six-by-eight-foot cell was the first of many lessons in gratitude Brandon taught me. Brandon was 18 when he took part in a robbery gone wrong. He had no prior history of violence. Brandon’s friends carjacked a white couple, Todd and Stacey Bagley, youth ministers innocently offering a ride to kids purportedly in need. Later, Brandon rejoined the group only to see Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the crime, fatally shoot Todd and Stacey in the head at close range. The man who had just shot two people in the head and still had a gun in his hand then ordered Brandon and three other teens to set the car on fire with the couple’s bodies inside.    At trial,  , meaning he offered the jury no alternative perspective on the charges. Brandon was the only accomplice not given an opportunity to plead guilty. The other accomplices pleaded out and received prison sentences; two are home with their families now.  Brandon was falsely portrayed as a hardened high-level gang member. Prosecutors suppressed evidence by their own gang expert that the gang had a 13-tier hierarchy with  . Brandon never got the chance to clarify his case in court — it remained the story poorly told at trial two decades earlier. Five of the nine surviving jurors  , stating that they would not have voted for the death penalty had prosecutors disclosed all facts at trial and had Brandon’s own lawyer competently defended him.   In her dissent written hours before Brandon’s execution, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor   “despite troubling allegations that the Government secured his death sentence by withholding exculpatory evidence and knowingly eliciting false testimony against him. [He] has never had the opportunity to test the merits of those claims in court. Now he never will.” Brandon became the youngest person, based on age when the offense occurred, to be put to death by the federal government in nearly 70 years,  . He was 40 when he died.  Brandon loved his life, even in its limited capacity on death row.   in his decades behind bars. This is no small feat given that death row is like a prison within a prison, with countless oppressive rules and ensuing frustrations.  Brandon mainly spent his time mentoring at-risk youth, reading, crocheting and playing the guitar. Brandon was calmer and more patient than most people I’ve come across; he spoke slowly and thoughtfully and was an avid listener. He never cursed and when I asked if that was for religious reasons, he said, “No, cursing just feels too aggressive to me.” A few days before his execution, Brandon’s family visited him for the last time.  After the visit, Brandon told me there was a hole in the pane of glass. I naively said, “Oh, so you were able to hold hands.” He explained it was an air hole to speak through, not large enough for hands, “But,” he said, “I could smell my mom.” In 20 years, including in his final days, Brandon was never allowed to physically touch a loved one. Never having physical contact is an inhumane daily assault on the soul. Brandon’s case fits the death row profile: His crime and trial took place in Texas, a state that has   of the national total. Brandon’s jury consisted of  . Brandon was Black — despite being 13% of the U.S. population, Blacks   of death row inmates. The victims are white in   of homicide death penalty cases. A recent   found that in executions involving interracial murders since 1976, 295 Black defendants were executed for killing white victims, while only 21 white defendants were executed for killing Black victims. Death row is riddled with racial bias and is disproportionately home to Black men   against a white person. Fairness cannot be achieved. Executions in our country, whether with rope or needle, have always been about race. President Joe Biden has   and to give incentives for states to do the same. There is a simple alternative to government executions: Keep people behind bars without resorting to killing them.   worldwide have abolished the death penalty. Italy abolished the death penalty in 1948;  . In the Netherlands, the last execution took place in 1952; Australia in 1967. Since ending the death penalty in 1976,  . The U.S. is the   to conduct executions. Even Russia stopped executions in 1996. Our country   with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt and Pakistan. We are very late in ending state-sponsored executions. It can be done; last month  . Brandon, with his typical positivity, would say now is the time. Friends sitting on death row for years have taught me many lessons: patience, keeping the conversation real and meaningful, and appreciating what I have.  The hassle of driving my daughter to school is now about holding her hand at stoplights and rolling the windows down so I can feel the air. The freedom. During our daily talks, I never had anything to offer Brandon other than my love and support. He never asked me for a single thing besides friendship. Brandon was religious, but since I’m not, I couldn’t offer him prayers or talk about how heaven is a better place. I could only helplessly listen and tell him that I love him.    were his deep regret to the victims’ families, his love for his own family and, true to his thoughtful nature, he told the prison guards not to let his execution upset them. Our final words to each other were about what he would visualize on the gurney to stay calm. I told him to imagine my arms holding him down instead of straps and he promised he would. I was crying and told him I was sorry I couldn’t save him. He said I saved him with my love.

Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a military crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup.   The junta's violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar's myriad ethnic armed groups. The US State Department said it was ordering the departure of \"non-emergency US government employees and their family members\". The decision was taken to protect the safety and security of staff and their families, the State Department said. World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta cadres with sanctions. But the pressure has not swayed the generals. Saturday, the annual Armed Forces Day, saw the biggest loss of life so far, with at least 107 people killed.   The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar's 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions. Three of them -- the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army (AA) -- on Tuesday threatened to join protesters' fight unless the military reined in its crackdown. While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days. A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible.   The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes. Further strikes were launched on Tuesday, but Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU's head of foreign affairs, said the group would continue its position of \"strongly supporting people's movement against (the) military coup\". The KNU's Fifth Brigade put out a statement on Tuesday condemning the air strikes and warning it had no option but to \"confront these serious threats\" posed by the military. Around 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes.   The Thai foreign ministry said late Tuesday about 2,300 have returned to Myanmar, while about 550 remain in Thailand. Karen activists have accused the Thai authorities of pushing people back and accused them of blocking UN refugee officials from the area. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha insisted that there was \"no influx\" of refugees and that the kingdom's authorities had not \"scared them off with guns or sticks\".

Huang shot to fame in Taiwan in 2019 after she rolled her eyes at then-Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu as she questioned him during a meeting, earning herself the media nickname \"Goddess of the Eyeroll.\" Huang won plaudits from people concerned about Han's plans for a trade agreement with China for pinning Han down in a bid to figure out exactly what such an agreement would entail. Han, who was elected on a pro-China, pro-business platform for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), went on to lose his job in 2020 to a voter recall campaign, in which more than 97 percent of those who voted wanted him gone. The recall came after Han lost the January 2020 presidential election to Tsai by a margin of two-and-a-half million votes after Tsai campaigned to lessen Chinese influence and attempts to undermine the island's democracy, citing Beijing's treatment of Hong Kong as an example. But in February this year, Han's supporters launched an unsuccessful bid to recall Huang, based on her alleged violation of a draconian national security law imposed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Hong Kong. Huang wept public tears of joy at the time. But her view of the campaign is much more sobering, two months after the event. \"I think it's hard to know whether to laugh or cry, actually,\" Huang told RFA in a recent interview. \"We live in a free society, but they use its privileges to strike a blow for totalitarian rule.\" \"Now I think I can say with much greater certainty that I didn't do anything wrong,\" she said. \"The majority of people stood by me, so we should keep working to promote that philosophy.\" She said the jailing of most of Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp and the banning of speech linked to the 2019 protest movement had woken Taiwan's 23 million people up to the potential dangers of cooperation with China. \"Such huge changes have taken place, not very long after the [1997] handover of Hong Kong,\" Huang said. \"People in Taiwan are much more vigilant.\" \"It's so easy for freedom and democracy to just disappear one day, so we should increase our efforts to guard this last bastion of democracy,\" Huang said. Huang has never been to Hong Kong, and now that she has spoken out against the crackdown, she is unlikely to risk arrest by going there in future. But she is at peace with her decisions, and called on more people to be outspoken about China's human rights violations. \"If everyone is afraid, then nobody will be willing to speak out about such things,\" Huang said. Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was occupied by the 1911 Republic of China under the Kuomintang (KMT) as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal with the allies. It has never been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, nor formed part of the People's Republic of China, but Beijing insists it will reclaim the island, by force if necessary. Public opinion polls have shown that the violent suppression of Hong Kong's anti-government protest movement last year fueled fears for Taiwan's national security and democracy, and that only around 4.5 percent of Taiwan's 23 million people welcome the idea of Chinese rule. The island began a transition to democracy following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162958", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12285", "source": "scrapy"},

Kyaw Zwar Minn, who had been outspoken against the Feb. 1 military takeover in Myanmar, was recalled by the military regime last month after he called for deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s release. On Wednesday, defense attaché Col. Soe Aung and at least two other diplomats seized control over the embassy in London’s posh Mayfair neighborhood, locking the ambassador out in what he called  “a kind of coup” reminiscent of the junta’s seizure of power in Naypyidaw. “We condemn the bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime in London yesterday, and I pay tribute to Kyaw Zwar Minn for his courage, British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab saying on Twitter. “The UK continues to call for an end to the coup and the appalling violence and a swift restoration of democracy.” Kyaw Zwar Minn on Thursday met with Nigel Adams, the foreign office minister for Asia, after the British government informed him they could no longer recognize him as ambassador once the junta had recalled him. “We will support him to ensure his safety and security in the United Kingdom,” Adams said on Twitter. \"Given the bullying behavior towards Mr. Minn, we are seeking to ensure he can live safely in the United Kingdom, while he decides his long-term future,\" a foreign office spokesperson said on Twitter. Barbar, a London-based Burmese activist described to RFA’s Myanmar Service how the embassy takeover unfolded. “While the ambassador was out, some people from the military attaché’s office came to knock on the door of the building. When a staff member opened the door, they pushed him in, locked the main door and told everyone to stay inside,” “A staff member sent a text message to the ambassador and he returned. But he was locked outside, so he sent messages to his friends among the Burmese community,” Barbar said. Barbar said the ex-ambassador told him there were three diplomats that took control of the embassy, but he did not know if they were armed. Min Hein, another London-based Burmese activist, told RFA he was near the ex-ambassador on the street in front of the embassy as his supporters gathered in front of the embassy to protest. “All the young Burmese people are here in front of the embassy and the ambassador is in his car. What I heard is that the ambassador left to go home after work, and soon after that the military attaché and a senior staff member called Kyi Win went into the building and locked the door from the inside,” Min Hein said. Min Hein confirmed the identities of the diplomats who took over the embassy. “There are at least three of them, the military attaché, Col. Soe Aung, Minister Counselor Kyi Win and Third Secretary Ye Lin Aung,” Min Hein said. He said none of the embassy staff supported Myanmar’s Civil Disobedience Movement, a mass movement opposing the military junta with labor strikes by civilservants and daily street protests. “They didn’t seem to be happy about the ambassador calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.” Kyaw Zwar Minn is a former colonel who served in Myanmar’s military for 30 years. He is one of a number of high-profile diplomats who spoke out against the Feb. 1 coup, a group that includes Myanmar’s ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Moe Tun, who was fired by the regime but continues to represent the country at the UN General Assembly in New York. The death toll from nine weeks of protests that have been met with repression and gunfire has surpassed 600 and was expected to rise as anti-junta activists carry out rallies across the country of 54 million people.

The American diplomat heaped praise on Bangladesh for its “extraordinary” generosity in sheltering the refugees from Myanmar, and even mentioned Dhaka’s controversial decision to relocate thousands to a flood-prone island. He called the current situation in Myanmar “one of the great moral challenges of the planet today,” in referring to a coup and deadly violence against civilians by the same military that caused hundreds of thousands of traumatized Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh in 2017. “Bangladesh has been one of the greatest helping hands, you’ve given them an island. You’ve helped people to be able to find a future, but that’s not a long-term future, and that doesn’t resolve the issue,” Kerry, President Joe Biden’s special envoy for the climate, told reporters in Dhaka. “So the new administration, Secretary [of State] Tony Blinken, is very cognizant of this issue, and very focused on it, and I know that he and the administration are going to do everything in their power to try to restore democracy to Myanmar, and in the doing of that, to try to be able to help relieve the pressure and the challenges that the Rohingya represent,” Kerry said in responding to a question from a BenarNews correspondent. Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen, who appeared at a press conference with Kerry, asked Washington’s special envoy for help in repatriating the Rohingya – about 1 million of whom are sheltering at densely crowded refugee camps in southeastern Cox’s Bazar district. The vast majority crossed the border into Bangladesh while escaping a brutal military offensive in their home state of Rakhine in 2017. “We hope that the U.S.’s proactive initiative can help with a safe and dignified return,” Momen said. Addressing climate issues, Kerry said, “We’re excited in the United States about the prospect of moving to this cleaner energy, this new future that protects our world for our children, our grandchildren, future generations, and we live up to our global responsibility to lead and to do what young people around the world are asking us to do – which is to behave like adults. And get the job done.” Kerry’s visit to South Asia came ahead of President Biden’s virtual “Leaders’ Summit on the Climate,” from April 22 until 23, and which will include 40 world leaders. His hours-long visit to the Bangladeshi capital was the third and final stop on an official trip, which also took him to Abu Dhabi and New Delhi. “[W]e’re delighted that Bangladesh will take part in President Biden’s summit, but equally importantly, we’re delighted that we have the ability to work together now, intentionally going forward, in order to bring technology, research and finance to do what we know what we must do,” he said, referring to an invitation, which he officially extended to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during his short trip to Dhaka. Hasina hosted Kerry at her residence and praised U.S. efforts under Biden to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate, after the previous administration had pulled the United States out of the international pact, which aims to reduce carbon emissions in countering global warming. “The returning of the U.S. to the Paris Agreement will create new momentum to the climate diplomacy,” she said, according to state-owned BSS news agency. Linking the Rohingya crisis with the climate crisis, Momen discussed how the refugee camps have had a negative effect. “About 1.1 million Rohingya are destroying our forest and ecosystem,” he said. As many as seven reserve forests, totaling about 2,500 acres, were wiped out in Cox’s Bazar as the Rohingya who began fleeing Myanmar in August 2017 cut down trees for firewood and to construct makeshift shelters, area forest officer Ali Kabir said two months later. Landslides that struck near the camps in 2018 killed at least a dozen people, including a Rohingya youth who was killed by a falling tree. Climate change, more broadly, is a critical issue for the South Asian country. Bangladesh loses 2.5 percent of its national income annually because of extreme weather-related phenomena, according to analysts. Experts have also warned about the effects of global warming causing erosion as sea levels rise and threaten low-lying areas along the country’s coastline, where millions of people live. Bangladesh chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 48 countries that are home to 1.2 billion people and have a combined gross domestic product valued at U.S. $2.3 trillion. Forum members collectively contribute only 5 percent of total emissions. The nation has been at the forefront in the climate negotiations as one of the leaders of the group of Least Developed Countries. “There are many issues that need to be sorted out in the climate change negotiations,” Md Ziaul Haque, an official who represents Bangladesh at climate negotiations, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service. “In terms of carbon emission, we are at the bottom, but we are one of the severely affected countries. Our main demand is to reduce carbon emission in line with the Paris Agreement and the developed and developing countries must do it,” he said. “Unless they reduce emissions, we will continue to be affected by severe weather conditions such as temperature rise, sea level rise, frequent and severe floods, droughts, river erosion, storms and so forth.” Kerry spoke about the “incredible spirit and helping hand” that Bangladesh has given to the Rohingya refugees. Efforts to provide food supplies to the Rohingya cost about U.S. $11 million per month, the World Food Program representative in Bangladesh said in March 2020. The U.S. has been the leading donor to the humanitarian response to the crisis in Myanmar’s Rakhine state and Bangladesh, having provided nearly $1.2 billion since August 2017. In October 2020, the U.S. donated $200 million of the $600 million raised in a virtual fundraiser to support United Nations efforts to assist Rohingya in Bangladesh and Myanmar. Meanwhile, since last December, Bangladesh has moved at least 18,000 Rohingya from refugee camps on the mainland to Bhashan Char, a Bay of Bengal island. The government plans to relocate 100,000 Rohingya there as a measure for relieving crowding at the camps in Cox’s Bazar, although international human rights groups and humanitarian organizations have voiced concerns about the island’s vulnerability to cyclones. The government, which has built housing and infrastructure to accommodate the refugees, insists that Bhashan Char is safe and that refugees are moving there voluntarily. Kerry also discussed U.S. efforts to push Myanmar back toward democracy. On Feb. 1, the military overthrew the government that was elected in November 2020 and arrested civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint and other political leaders. Since then, military and security forces have cracked down on protesters, killing at least 618 people, according to Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a Thai NGO. “I know that we fought very hard to try to see Myanmar move in a different direction and we had high expectations and we talked frequently with and worked with Aung San Suu Kyi to try to move the process forward,” said Kerry, who served as U.S. secretary of state during the second Obama administration (2013-2017). “I personally visited Naypyidaw and met with the generals and we tried very hard, to hold, to have an accountability that met the highest universal standards of human behavior ... they have not honored that.”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163002", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13937", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.jagran.com", "section": "\n", "sub_section": ["/topics/coronavirus"], "article_url": "https://www.jagran.com/world/other-coronavirus-world-update-former-bangladesh-pm-khalida-jia-infected-with-coronavirus-2200-people-died-in-mexico-21549680.html", "title": null, "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "भारत समेत दुनिया के तमाम मुल्‍कों में कोरोना संक्रमण से रोजाना सैकड़ों मौतें हो रही हैं। बांग्लादेश की पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री खालिदा जिया रविवार को कोरोना वायरस से संक्रमित पाई गईं। कोरोना महामारी के चलते एक साल पहले उन्हें जेल से अस्थाई तौर पर रिहा किया गया था। वहीं पिछले चौबीस घंटों के दौरान मैक्सिको में 2,192 लोगों की कोरोना वायरस से मौत हुई है। यही नहीं चौबीस घंटों के दौरान ईरान में भी 258 लोगों की मौत हुई है। बांग्लादेश नेशनलिस्ट पार्टी (बीएमपी) की प्रमुख खालिदा जिया के नमूने शनिवार को जांच के लिए भेजे गए थे। बांग्‍लादेश के स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय के जन संपर्क अधिकारी मैदुल इस्लाम प्रधान ने बताया कि रविवार को खालिदा जिया की जांच रिपोर्ट आई जिसमें संक्रमण की पुष्टि हुई।  ब्राजील में बीते 24 घंटे में कोरोना संक्रमण से 2,616 लोगों की मौत हो गई है। इसके साथ ही देश में कोरोना महामारी से मरने वालों की संख्‍या 351,334 हो गई है। ब्राजील के स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य मंत्रालय ने बताया कि बीते 24 घंटे में कोरोना संक्रमण के 71,832 नए मामले सामने आए जिसके साथ ही संक्रमितों का आंकड़ा 13,445,006 हो गया है।  वहीं मैक्सिको में बीते 24 घंटों के दौरान 2,192 लोगों की कोरोना संक्रमण से मौत हुई है। यह पहली बार है जब एक दिन में इतनी बड़ी संख्या में महामारी से मौत हुई है। मैक्सिको में बीमारी से जान गंवाने वालों की तादाद लगभग दो लाख 10 हजार हो गई है। अमेरिका, ब्राजील और रूस के बाद सर्वाधिक मौतें मैक्सिकों में हुई हैं। \n  वहीं ईरान में बीते 24 घंटे में 258 लोगों की कोरोना संक्रमण से मौत हो गई है। इसके साथ ही देश में कोरोना महामारी से मरने वालों का आंकड़ा 64,490 हो गया है। ईरान में बीते 24 घंटे में कोरोना संक्रमण के 21,063 नए मामले सामने आए जिसके साथ ही देश में संक्रमितों का आंकड़ा 2,070,141 हो गया है। \n  अमेरिका में कोरोना संक्रमितों आंकड़ा तीन करोड़ 11 लाख को पार कर गया है जबकि अब तक पांच लाख 61 हजार से ज्‍यादा मरीजों की मौत हो चुकी है। ब्रिटेन में कोरोना संक्रमितों का आंकड़ा 43.82 लाख को पार कर गया है जबकि 1,27,324 लोगों की जान जा चुकी है।  चीन की कोरोना वैक्सीन कितनी असरदार है, इसको लेकर समय-समय पर सवाल उठते रहे हैं। अब चीन के अधिकारी ही उसके वैक्सीन फ्रॉड की पोल खोल रहे हैं। एक रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक चीन के एक शीर्ष रोग नियंत्रण अधिकारी ने कहा है कि देश में विकसित किए गए कोरोना टीके कम असरदार हैं। अधिकारी ने यह भी कहा है कि चीन की शी चिनफिंग सरकार इन टीकों को असरदार बनाने पर विचार कर रही है। \n \n", "image_url": "<img id=\"jagran_image_id\" src=\"//www.jagranimages.com/images/newimg/11042021/11_04_2021-coronavius_cases_21549680.jpg\" alt=\"बांग्लादेश की पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री खालिदा जिया रविवार को कोरोना वायरस से संक्रमित पाई गईं।\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to prepare for the launch of such workplace vaccination. According to news agency  , Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries said a substantial proportion of the population aged 45 years and above is in the organised sector of the economy and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private) or manufacturing and services. \"In order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations,   vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing COVID vaccination centre,\" Bhushan said in the letter . He said the states can initiate due consultations with private/public sector employers and management to prepare for launch of workplace vaccination. \"Such workplace vaccination centres may be launched across states/Union Territories from 11 April, 2021,\" he said. The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to make adequate preparations and issued guidelines in this regard. According to the government's guidance note, workplace vaccination sessions may be organised to facilitate optimal utilization of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage. \"Organizing vaccination at the workplace will not only be convenient to the staff at workplaces but also help to avoid travel and hence reducing the risk of exposure to   virus,\" it said. According to the guidelines, only employees aged 45 years or more will be eligible for vaccination at workplaces and no outsiders including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination. One of the senior staff of the organisation will be assigned to work as nodal officer to coordinate with district health authorities/ private COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) and support vaccination activities. The beneficiaries will be required to register in Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination and CVC nodal officer will ensure registration of all targeted beneficiaries and facility of on-the-spot registration will also be available but only to employees of the workplace, the guidelines said. Once identified, the workplace   vaccination centres will also have to register on the Co-WIN portal as government or private CVC at workplace. For optimal utilisation of resources, vaccination sessions will be planned at workplace CVC once at least 50 beneficiaries get registered for vaccination. \"The schedule of vaccination sessions can be made up to 15 days in advance and intimated to the workplaces so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of vaccination. In most of the workplaces vaccination schedules may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,\" the Centre told states and union territories in the guidelines. The District Task Force chaired by district magistrate and Urban Task Force chaired by municipal commissioner will identify such government and private workplaces after due deliberations with relevant employers. Every CVC in a government workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the government medical facility while every CVC in a private workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the private medical facility. The designated government and private CVC to whom the workplace CVC has been tagged will be responsible for the deployment of the vaccination team at workplace CVCs. All government and private CVCs are already linked to some cold chain points for receiving vaccines. \"These CVCs will continue to use the same mechanism to receive the vaccine needed for vaccination at tagged workplace CVC,\" the guidelines said. \"Some of the work places may have health infrastructure in form of hospitals, health clinics, nursing centers, etc. This infrastructure may be utilized to set-up vaccination site in case sufficient space for waiting, vaccination and observation rooms are available,\" the guidelines stated. The healthcare workers of this health infrastructure of the workplace CVCs (such as doctors, nurses and other staff) may be deployed for the   vaccination activities at workplaces as vaccination team members, it said. The workplace CVCs staff engaged in   vaccination activities will follow the same SOPs for vaccination and reporting including management and reporting of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The government has also spelled out the requirements for AEFI management at the workplace CVCs. In order to avoid mixing of vaccine types in first and second dose, only one type of vaccine will be provided at such sessions that are conducted at the workplaces. While the anti-   vaccination at government workplaces organised by district health authorities will be free of cost, inoculation organised by private CVC would be on payment basis and will be charged the same rate as that for vaccination at private health facility (Rs 250 per person per dose).  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Centre to allow COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces having 100 eligible beneficiaries from 11 April\" alt=\"Centre to allow COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces having 100 eligible beneficiaries from 11 April\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Covid-Vaccination_PTI_640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163002", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "43446", "source": "scrapy"},

Its UK counterpart, however, said it would offer people under 30 the choice of another product. The European Medicines Agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. It said most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination — but based on the currently available evidence, it was not able to identify specific risk factors. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the United Kingdom, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. “The reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine,” said Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director. But it placed no new age restrictions on using the vaccine in people 18 and over, as some countries have done. “The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects.,” Cooke said. Dr. June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, echoed that sentiment, saying that the benefits “continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.” She called the unusual clots a “potential side effect” of the vaccine and said the evidence was “firming up,” but more study was needed to be sure. The EMA, the World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against   outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots. The announcements could have far-reaching effects on the use of the shot that is key to global efforts to end the pandemic. The EMA's investigation was particularly focused on two types of rare blood clots: one that appears in multiple blood vessels and another that occurs in a vein that drains blood from the brain. It also evaluated reports of people who had low levels of blood platelets, which puts them at risk of severe bleeding. As recently as last week, the EMA said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population” — a response to several countries doing just that — though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected. In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine. Meanwhile, Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, never suspended use of the vaccine. The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic. Dr Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine globally could have serious consequences. “We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said. That’s because the vaccine is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries. It has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine. The governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region had said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot. “If they do like Germany, and allow Astra Zeneca only to people over 65, that would be absurd. Before it was only for people under 55. Put yourself in the place of citizens, it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters on Wednesday. The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary. “If there are in fact individuals of a certain age group that could have a higher risk (of clotting) then we need to adjust its use,” Casado told Spanish public radio. “We are not questioning AstraZeneca. We need all the vaccines possible to reach the goal of 70% of the adult population.” French health authorities said they, too, were awaiting EMA’s conclusions and would follow the agency’s recommendations, especially for the 500,000 people who have received the first dose of AstraZeneca. Even officials in Asia said they were keen to hear the EMA's decision. On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said it would also pause a vaccine rollout to school nurses and teachers that was to begin on Thursday while awaiting the outcome of the EMA’s review. English, the former chair of a British Medical Association committee, said that even rare, serious side effects are seen with established vaccines and that policymakers often decide that bigger public health goals warrant their use, citing the polio vaccine as an example.

Amidst a national lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery.   On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American's lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US. Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31. He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.   The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country. No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday mid-night, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House will not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban.   I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today, Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden. The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work  and millions more desperate to make ends meet  now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources, he wrote. In his letter, Hawley wrote that the unemployment rate remains at 6.2 per cent  with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis  and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions, he said.   In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers. I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programmes to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm, Hawley added.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17424", "source": "scrapy"},

The law gives government ministers powers to order social media sites to put warnings next to posts authorities deem to be false, and in extreme cases get them taken down. Facebook, Twitter and Google - who have their Asian headquarters in Singapore - were given temporary exemptions from a handful of provisions in the act to give them time to adapt. If an action is judged to be malicious and damaging to Singapore's interests, companies could be hit with fines of up to $720,000, while individuals could face jail terms of up to 10 years. Authorities in the tightly controlled country - long criticised for restricting civil liberties - insist the measures are necessary to stop the circulation of falsehoods that could sow divisions in society and erode trust in institutions. But the laws have sparked outrage from rights groups, who fear they could stifle online discussion, tech companies and media organisations. Journalist and activist Kirsten Han, who is the Editor-in-Chief of independent media outlet New Naratif, said the legislation was \"extremely worrying\".  \"It’s such a broad law that it's hard to predict how it's going to be applied. What's of immediate concern is the chilling effect and the further entrenchment of self-censorship,\" she told AFP. After the law was passed in May, Google said it was concerned the legislation will \"hurt innovation and the growth of the digital information ecosystem\". A group of nearly 100 academics worldwide also expressed concern over the law, warning earlier this year that it could threaten academic freedom.

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163000", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47703", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163005", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54751", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.seelatest.com", "section": "education", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.seelatest.com/answer-key/rbi-office-attendant-9-april-exam-analysis-shift-1-2-asked-questions-answer-key", "title": "\n                                        ", "author": "\n                                                                                        By ", "author_link": "https://www.seelatest.com/author/rohitsindhu", "published_date": "\n                                        ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday, 9th April conducts Office Attendant examination in Computer Based Mode.

In a recent press conference by Home Secretary Priti Patel, a lot of data was released. She claimed that crime in the country has fallen by 21 per cent, while cases on online fraud and underage sexual exploitation have gone up. According to Patel, people across the country have been conned, and the national loss is expected to be worth £1.8million.   “Fraudsters are exploiting coronavirus as a hook for new acquisitive crimes with losses to victims already exceeding £1.8million”, the Home Secretary thundered to the nation. The UK is nearing the 10,000 mark in terms of recorded deaths. The Prime Minister Boris Johnson who had tested positive for the virus is now showing signs of recovery. Recently, the UK police were criticised for using extreme measures in enforcing the nationwide lockdown. She said that the powers “will be reviewed”. Patel also added that over 400 suspects of domestic abuse were arrested over the last two weeks. There is no clarity on the timeline for lifting restrictions: “None of us can stand here today... and speculate in terms of when restrictions might move and when they will be lifted”. While referring to the increasing cases of acts related to cyber pedophilia, she said, “the perpetrators of sickening online child abuse are seeking to exploit the fact that more and more young people and children are at home and online. And in the last week the National Domestic Abuse Helpline reported a 120 per cent increase in the number of calls it received in one 24-hour period”. The Home Secretary further warned the public against stringent police action in case people were spotted breaking lockdown rules. “To anyone still refusing to do the right thing is clear. If you don't play your part, our selfless police - who are out there risking their own lives to save others - will be unafraid to act”, she said On a lighter note, she extended gratitude to emergency workers. “I’d like to thank them - our police officers and staff who are working tirelessly to keep us safe, for engaging with the public so constructively, to encourage everyone to do the right thing and avoid the need to use these powers”.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2018/09/11/24898-factbox-20170628111325.jpg?itok=_-a2ajbL\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163005", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22073", "source": "scrapy"},

Over time, the rate of infection seems to have slowed down. \r\n \r\nWith strict lockdowns and rigorous testing, the numbers seem to have been brought under control.

The proposals will be presented by the government to the Assemblee Nationale and then put forth for voting. According to the new survey, only 43 per cent of the population now supports the strict enforcement of lockdown. Last week, the lockdown had the support of the majority, with over 51 per cent of the population in its favour. The strict confinement measures in place refer to a complete shutdown of industry and all non-essential services including schools and businesses without which the majority of the population can survive. \r\n \r\nThe survey further shed light on what the citizens expect from the government. 82 per cent of them expect the government to provide free masks to the general population, and more than three quarters want the blanket ban on cultural and sports gatherings to continue.   \r\n \r\nThe public is also in line with the government’s demands to ensure that people work from home. However, school teachers believe that they are being used to improve the general population’s immunity against the virus. \r\n \r\nThe government has repeatedly asserted the risk of reopening schools and universities too early, and intends to do it in a “progressive and careful” way. Many who need to access public transport to reach their respective schools and workplaces have expressed fear over what may transpire if they try to venture out too early.

However, many countries continue to pursue their territorial interests through this tough time, as the world turns a blind eye to everything but the virus. \r\n \r\nFrom China’s aggression in the South China Sea to Saudi Arabia’s surprising progressive change in punishment laws, the world is truly witnessing unprecedented times. \r\n \r\nRecently, a country is trying to push legislation which will effectively end the legal recognition of the transgender population. \r\n \r\nHungary’s government, largely seen as right-wing, is trying to pass a legislation which aims to define biological sex based simply on “primary sex characteristics and chromosomes”. If put into motion, people will no longer will be legally allowed to change their gender. Trans community already faces scorn and legal invalidation across the globe, and with coronavirus at the centre of all legislative action, this law might be passed unnoticed. \r\n \r\nThe Guardian reported that to be able to do menial tasks like renting a bicycle or buying a travel pass requires displaying one’s ID. However, if this law were to pass, people who have changed their gender and or any desire to do so will not be able to avail such facilities. \r\n \r\nViktor Orban, the Hungarian Prime Minister recently faced flak for introducing a law allowing him to rule by decree - indefinitely. All this happened in the midst of a pandemic, denying the world an opportunity to react. It’s important to note here how protesting - the most vocal and effective way to change the route of any legislation remains disallowed across the globe owing to social distancing norms in place, as coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human. An independent member of parliament Bernadett Szel openly referred to the law as “evil” and a “step back in time”. Szel attempted to shed light on the discriminatory nature of the law in the parliament but was shut down. “We have a pandemic going on and all of us should be focusing on two things: healthcare issues and helping people financially to secure their wellbeing. What is happening in Hungary is a scandal,” she added during the hearing. Even though there is no clarity on when exactly the bill will be passed, it looks like the government is pursuing it, considering its passage through committees. There’s another issue with the law - it could stir problem whose gender on paper is different from their sex at birth. Their identities remain threatened under this legislation.

In India, a man bought a huge stock of onions so that he may be able to move from the southern part of the country to its northern state. The hardest hit continent - Europe has largely remained under lockdown over the last few weeks. However, as the recovery rate starts to improve and the number of infections continue to drop, people are sneaking out and about. Spain has a loophole in its lockdown rules: people with pets may leave their homes to walk their pets. However, not everybody is walking their pets. With no clear dictation of what encapsulates pets, people have taken full liberty. Just on Friday, the Spanish National Police shared an image on Twitter whereby a man was fined for walking an unusual pet… a fish in a bowl! The incident happened in Lograno, a town in northern Spain. He was later penalised by the authorities for breaking the code. \r\n \r\nThe tweet below translates into \"Agents of the police force have found a person for going out to \"walk\" their fish on the street. Agents spotted him on #Logroño carrying a fish tank against what is stipulated in the RD of the State of Alarm.\" Earlier, on March 25, a man was seen walking his hen. Take a look below! The police tweeted, \"Civil guards of #Lanzarote fined a person for failing to comply with the movement limitation measures imposed by the state of alarm while walking a hen\". In another bizarre incident in Spain, an unidentified citizen in Murcia was seen dressed as a Tyrannosaurus rex. The images went viral on social media! It only gets stranger in the land of Spain: Another person was arrested for walking a toy dog on a leash. Video below: After this clip went viral, the police announced: \"Do not try to deceive us!\" Spain recently decided to extend its lockdown until May 9, to ensure that the slowing rate of infections continues steadily. In Spain alone, over 20,000 people have died of the virus so far.

The prime minister after consultations on Friday instructed the Ministry of Commerce and his economic team to immediately take steps to facilitate the relevant sectors, value added, apparel and sugar, by finding alternative cheap sources of import of the needed commodities, the Dawn newspaper quoted sources as saying.   Various proposals have been presented to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) which considers these suggestions from an economic and commercial point of view. After consideration by the ECC, its decisions are presented to the Cabinet for ratification and final approval, the report said. In the present case, a proposal was presented to the ECC to allow the import of cotton, cotton yarn and sugar from India keeping in view domestic requirements, it said. With regards to the ECC decision to allow import of sugar, cotton and cotton yarn from India, Khan held consultations with key members of his Cabinet on Friday and decided that Pakistan could not go ahead with any trade with India under the current circumstances, it said.   The ECC had decided on commercial grounds to recommend these imports for the Cabinet's consideration. While the decision was not on the formal agenda of the Cabinet meeting, the issue was brought up by Cabinet members and the prime minister instructed that the ECC's decision be deferred and immediately reviewed, the report said. The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Khan on Thursday rejected the proposal of the high-powered committee to import cotton from India, with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserting that there can be no normalisation of ties until New Delhi reverses its decision in 2019 to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.   Pakistan's U-turn on Thursday came a day after the ECC, under newly-appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, recommended importing cotton and sugar from India, lifting a nearly two-year-long ban on its import from the neighbouring country amidst tensions over the Kashmir issue. India has said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility, and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility. India has also told Pakistan that talks and terror cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.   The ECC's decision had raised hopes of a partial revival of Pakistan-India bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on the import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. India's move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163005", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17113", "source": "scrapy"},

The Pakistani media reports had further claimed that if the confidence-building measures (CBMs) hold and ties improve further, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may pay a visit to Islamabad for the Saarc summit there later this year. The developments come in the wake of a sudden perceptible improvement in India-Pakistan ties in the past six weeks following the implementation of the ceasefire at the Line of Control by the armies of the two countries.   “Our respective high commissions exist and are functioning. So that’s a very effective channel of communication”, MEA spokesman Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday, in response to reporters’ queries on the back-channel talks. When asked whether there could be any Saarc summit in Islamabad which could be attended by Prime Minister Modi, as claimed in Pakistani media reports, the MEA spokesman termed it as “speculation”, adding that he did not have anything to share on this for now. Just last week, in a “swift U-turn” on Thursday following a “political backlash”, the Pakistan government had “deferred” its move to import cotton and sugar from India and linked it to the condition that India should first restore Article 370 on Jammu and Kashmir that was abrogated two years ago. However, some optimistic Pakistani media reports are referring to this as a “temporary bump”.    ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 163006", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16236", "source": "scrapy"}
