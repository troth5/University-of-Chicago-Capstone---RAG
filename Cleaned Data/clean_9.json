Driven by state interests, Beijing’s plans for developing Tibet have left Tibetans “alienated and isolated from meaningful development and modernization,” says the report by the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, “Distorted Development: Chinese Discourses on the Right to Development and its Implementation in Tibet.” “The international community has repeatedly condemned the Chinese government for their violations of human rights inside Tibet,” said TCHRD director Tsering Tsomo, speaking at a press conference in Dharamsala on Tuesday to announce the release of the report. “But the Chinese Communist Party has explicitly ignored this by highlighting what it calls the heightened Chinese model of development and infrastructure,” which it says is lifting Tibetans out of poverty in Tibet, Tsomo said. “The Chinese government insists that the economic welfare of the people is their most important right,” Tsomo said, adding, “However, they have threatened all other fundamental rights by making them subordinate to economic rights.” “And the government has also failed to provide any disaggregated data to show the number of Tibetans who are actually benefiting from this development,” she said. China’s development policies in Tibet are designed “to assimilate the region and its people into the framework of a single Chinese national identity rather than to meaningfully improve the lives of Tibetans,” TCHRD says in its report, pointing to the widespread forced removal of Tibetan herders from traditional grazing grounds. “Because China’s development policy has succeeded in urbanizing rural Tibetans and erasing their land rights, it has succeeded in creating pristine wilderness through depopulation, sinicizing economic centres in towns and cities ensuring investments and profits flow back to China Proper,” the rights group says. It has also built infrastructure, including highways and railways, to pull Tibet and its resources “closer to China, extracting natural minerals and resources, and building hydroelectric power to fulfill distant coastal China’s thirst for energy.” Bilingual education schemes that undermine the teaching of the Tibetan language have further disadvantaged Tibetans looking for employment in profitable sectors of the economy, while Tibetan herders forced from their land have been left unprepared for a shift to the modern job market now dominated by Chinese migrants, TCHRD says in its report. Preferential investment by China in Chinese companies in Tibetan urban areas has meanwhile ensured that profits flow out of Tibet and back to China, making Tibet a “remittance economy.” “In the future, as China accelerates and intensified efforts to move Tibetans to urban centres, this will mean a continued pattern of marginalization and alienation from economic opportunities that are already dominated by migrants,” TCHRD sayds. “Tibetans insufficiently prepared for the socioeconomic shift from rural living to the modern job market will continue to be relegated in job opportunities in favor of migrants, and directly marginalized by policy implemented in the name of development.” Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following a failed 1959 national uprising against Chinese rule. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans’ political activities and peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162239", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12475", "source": "scrapy"},

According to a report in 'The Telegraph' the courses will cover dressing room culture, raise awareness of how behaviour can be interpreted by different cultures and encourage people to challenge anything they deem to be unacceptable after 'banter' was identified as a mask for racism.   In the survey, done by the Professional Cricketers' Association, 45 per cent of more than 600 respondents claimed that racism had come from a fellow player, 10 per cent said it was from a coach, and around 30 per cent had experienced it on social media or from fans. About 62 per cent of the surveyed players agreed with the suggestion, while 70 per cent believed specific education on racism and diversity would help improve the situation. \"Only 173 of professional players replied to the survey which the PCA believes shows the level of work they still have to undertake to ensure cricketers realise the importance of anti-racism education,\" the report added.   Of the respondents, 24 were identified as black, Asian or from ethnic minority backgrounds (which is around 90 per cent of the number of BAME players in the game). In total, 12 from BAME backgrounds had experienced some form of racism.

Mohammad Nabi and Gulbadin Naib were some of the prominent faces seen at the ceremony. It is not uncommon in Afghanistan when people marry at such a young age. Mujeeb, however, is not the world's youngest cricketer to marry, according to Michael Jones, a cricket enthusiast. “Don't know for sure, but Alan Butcher (former England cricketer) would be a strong candidate. He was 18 at the time of his marriage, and his son Mark was born soon afterwards,” Jones, who loves to have fun with figures and cricket statistics, said exclusively over the telephone from England.     The age difference between Alan Butcher and his eldest son Mark, who played 71 Tests, is 18 years. Mark is now in Pakistan commentating on the PSL. Alan Butcher, speaking from England, said, \"Yes, I did marry at the age of 18\".

Finding her allegations “completely false, provocative and intemperate” statements, the EC said Ms Banerjee’s attacks and “attempts to berate and vilify the Central paramilitary forces during the electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation among the rank and file of these forces, who have been rendering yeoman’s service since the late 1980s in election after election….”   It also noted that the two-time CM “has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central paramilitary forces… Far more discouraging is the fact that Ms Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other. In fact, Ms Banerjee is sparing no efforts to ensure that a deep wedge and drift is created amongst them which is bound to have serious consequential damage even after the process of elections is over.”   Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in the city on Friday for the poll campaign, tore into the TMC chief over her all-out criticism of the Central forces and the accusations against him. Rejecting her claims, he observed that he had never heard of “a CM of a state or the head of a political party making attacking comments on the Central forces like Ms Banerjee.” Mr Shah urged the TMC chief to apply her “common sense”, reminding her of the “control” of the EC, instead of his ministry, on the Central forces during the polls. He also argued that Ms Banerjee has been “frustrated”, realising that she was facing defeat in the polls, which is reflected in her comments. “She should reply to the notice from the EC to her,” the Union home minister said.   The TMC chief, however, remained defiant despite the massive pressure that is mounting on her since this was the second notice in a gap of 24 hours to her from the EC over her violations of the MCC.  “I will keep talking against the CRPF and BSF as long as they are with the BJP. Otherwise, I will salute them. I respect and salute the jawans of our country. However, I would not do the same to those who are working on the instructions of Mr Shah. I will better die rather than saluting Mr Shah,” she told a TMC rally at Jamalpur in Burdwan East.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162242", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17078", "source": "scrapy"},

Among those taken into custody are Tibetans suspected of sharing information on the deaths of Chinese soldiers killed in a border clash with India last June in the Galwan Valley of Ladakh, a source in Lhasa told RFA’s Tibetan Service on Monday. “The Chinese government has increased these arrests and crackdowns in Lhasa and in border areas,” RFA’s source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “And those who are suspected of exchanging information regarding the deaths of the Chinese soldiers on the border are immediately arrested.” “They have also deployed more blue-uniformed soldiers in Lhasa and in [Shigatse prefecture’s] Nyalam county,” an area located along the mountainous border with Nepal,” the source said, adding, “and authorities are stepping up their checks on the use of social media in Tibet these days.” Chinese authorities in Tibet maintain tight controls over information flows in the region, arresting Tibetans for sharing news and opinions on social media and for contacting relatives living in exile, sometimes with news of anti-China protests, according to rights groups and other experts. Particular targets of censors and police are images of exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama shared on mobile phones and calls for the preservation of the Tibetan language, now under threat from government orders to establish Chinese as the main language of instruction in Tibetan schools. China does not want reports of conditions inside Tibet to spread outside the country, Tsewang Dorjee, a researcher at the Dharamsala, India-based Tibet Policy Institute, told RFA. And with March 10, observed by Tibetans around the world as National Uprising Day, approaching in just a few days, “the authorities are putting more restrictions in place and cracking down even harder on Tibetans,\" Dorjee said. “And not only in Tibet, but also in China, the government has imposed tighter restrictions all around because there have been more criticisms from citizens on how the Chinese Communist Party handled the border dispute,” he said. “Though India quickly acknowledged the names and numbers of its dead on the border, China did not comment on its own casualties until February 2021,” Dorjee said. China regularly tightens security in Tibet’s regional capital Lhasa and in other Tibetan areas of China during important political gatherings in Beijing and in March, a month of politically sensitive anniversaries. On March 10, 1959, Tibetans in Lhasa rose up in protest of Beijing’s tightening political and military control of the formerly independent Tibet, sparking a rebellion in which thousands were killed. And on March 14, 2008, a riot in Lhasa followed the suppression by Chinese police of four days of peaceful Tibetan protests and led to the destruction of Han Chinese shops in the city and deadly attacks on Han Chinese residents. The riot then sparked a wave of mostly peaceful protests against Chinese rule that spread across Tibet and into Tibetan-populated regions of western Chinese provinces, and hundreds of Tibetans were detained, beaten, or shot as Chinese security forces quelled the protests. Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans’ political activities and peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162242", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12143", "source": "scrapy"},

Cynics might roll their eyes but the prime minister knows that as soon as it’s called a festival it becomes a red-letter day in our minds. Amazon and Flipkart can do “Tika Utsav” bumper sales starting on 12:01 am on 11 April until 11:59 pm on 14 April. Pizza Hut can deliver Tika Utsav special pizzas - with tika kebab toppings of course. Each city can have friendly contests to see which centre doles out the most shots in one day, that’s vaccine shots, not alcoholic ones. Anything that encourages vaccination is of course something to be encouraged. And the prime minister is in his own way a cheerleader-in-chief for the nation. Thus he is to be commended for trying to encourage all eligible Indians to go out and get vaccinated. And if some upbeat festival messaging works better than doom-and-gloom portents so be it. Of course, there is a danger that in the rush to celebrate tika utsavs, we could crowd vaccination centres and forget about social distancing but that’s a minor quibble. But what feels incongruous is this cheery PSA for a “festival of vaccination” occurs at the same time as a “festival of democracy” is unfolding in so many states across India. The pandemic and the election seem to be occurring in different worlds, hermetically sealed from each other. There are two Indias, one in which a   second wave is raging and one in which elections are happening and apparently never the twain shall meet. Mind you this is a country where a court rules that you can be fined for not wearing your mask while alone in your car. A vehicle is a “public place” says the Delhi High Court but a political rally is obviously not. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan recently scolded his fellow citizens for letting down their guard and allowing the Covid numbers to explode afresh. He blamed “lack of commitment and sincerity” and said, “nobody is interested in wearing the mask.. there’s no respect for the norms of physical distancing.” , the same minister shared pictures of his party leaders holding election rallies where hardly anyone was wearing a mask and there was certainly no physical distancing happening. “One look at Harsh Vardhan’s Twitter feed makes it quite clear who could be called out “for taking everything casually’” writes Rohan Venkataramakrishnan in  . It’s not a BJP problem. It’s a problem pretty much across the political spectrum. Old habits die hard. Old electioneering habits die especially hard. Photographs from rallies across Bengal for example, whether Trinamool or BJP or the Left Front-Congress combine, would hardly suggest the country is grappling with a pandemic. It looks just like something from five years ago. Perhaps the fact that the Bihar elections did not cause a huge explosion in infections lulled us into a false sense of complacency. But these elections are happening in the middle of a certified second wave. Yet the same politicians who wag their fingers at the public for giving safety precautions a “tilanjali” seem to have no interest in leading by example. And they do not even see the jarring dissonance. It is obviously not easy in a country like India to do physical distancing at the best of times, let alone at election time. But we can do our bit. The symbolism matters. Though Donald Trump sneered at Joe Biden for wearing a mask during his campaign, Biden resolutely stuck to it. The open-air inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with the guests wearing masks sent out two messages - one, that the business of democracy and transition of power must go one and two, they must go on with as much safety precautions as possible in these grave times. It was about fortitude in face of a pandemic not the denial of it. It will never be foolproof but the message is important. The visual of masked politicians on stage at an election rally in India would send out a message as well. A top political leader taking his mask off to address the rally and then putting it back on would send out a message. Similarly, a crowded stage filled with maskless jostling politicians sends out its own message to the rank and file. A political candidate in Kolkata told reporters asking him about lack of masks and safety norms that he was “not afraid” of the virus and he would win, Covid or no Covid. Tirath Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand tells devotees planning to attend Mahakumbh that “nobody will be stopped in the name of   ” because “faith is stronger than fear”. Two days later he tested positive. At this point it’s baffling that politicians still think bravado is the vaccine we all need. Now the Haridwar district magistrate has said all schools in the district will remain closed from 9 to 15 April not because of   fears but “in view of a huge rush of devotees to Kumbh Mela.”    It’s clear that after a year everyone is suffering from Covid safety exhaustion. The masks are slipping and weddings and parties are back and public transport is crowded. We read about rising numbers and lack of beds but there’s no indication that it’s affecting our behaviour. A video of a cheerful woman at a temple during Holi telling a reporter there was no Covid there recently went viral. Despite Yogi Adityanath’s strongman reputation in Uttar Pradesh, his exhortation to maintain safety protocols during Holi seemed to fall on many deaf ears. People are tired of a year of safety protocols or lulled by the dip in numbers at the end of 2020 or both. But now that the second wave has truly landed, mixed messages from the political leaders do not help. While the PM exhorts us to not let down our guard, we just hear \"no lockdown\". The prime minister in his message about the second wave has reiterated the focus needs to be on “test, track, treat, Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid management”. That’s commendable. But perhaps the time has come for politicians of all parties, not just the aam aadmi, to also exhibit that “Covid-appropriate behaviour”. And if we must turn everything into a festival, what about a month-long “mask festival” instead of just a tika one?", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" alt=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tamil-nadu-election_BJP_PTI_640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162242", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "45153", "source": "scrapy"},

He was rushed by his wife Dona and elder brother Snehasis at around 1 pm to Woodlands Hospital where he has been admitted to the intensive critical care unit. The 48-year-old former Indian cricket captain, who have a family history of ischemic heart disease and complained of a chest and back pain on Friday, was found with blockages in his heart, said CEO of the private hospital Dr Rupali Basu. She added, \"Sourav underwent angiography and angioplasty in one of three arteries. His condition is stable and conscious now.\"   Dr Aftab Khan, a cardiologist of the five member-medical board treating Sourav, said, \"We will now take a decision how to clear the blockages in the rest two arteries. He is under observation.\" Sourav spoke to Dona and their daughter: Sana later. He will be at the hospital at least for the next four-five days. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted, \"Sad to hear that @SGanguly99 suffered a mild cardiac arrest and has been admitted to hospital. Wishing him a speedy and full recovery. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family!\" She and several other state ministers visited Sourav later. \"He is fine and smiling. Lying on the bed he rather asked me: how is your health? He is our pride. I do not how it happened to him. I heard he never underwent any test despite being such a big sportsperson of international stature. I was not aware of it. I thank the hospital authorities and doctors for their prompt treatment,\" Ms Banerjee said.   Sourav's illness comes amid a speculation of a renewed attempt by the BJP to rope in him as it's chief ministerial candidate with the Bhoomiputra face for the upcoming West Bengal Assembly Election though he swept away the offer earlier. Worried about his ill health, union home minister Amit Shah, who shared the dais with him at a cricket event in New Delhi on December 28, inquired about his condition from senior BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya who has been in touch with the hospital authorities. Some BJP leaders also visited the hospital. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, whom Sourav met a week ago before meeting Mr Shah, also visited Sourav. Wishing his speedy recovery, he said, \"I interacted with him. I am greatly relieved like millions of followers of him all over the world.\" Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar tweeted, \"Just got to know about your ailment Sourav.

Kunchok Jinpa, aged 51 and a Driru (Chinese, Biru) county resident, had vanished in custody after being detained in November 2013, and died on Feb. 6 in a hospital in Lhasa after being transferred from his prison in critical condition, Tibetan sources and rights groups said. Jinpa had suffered from paralysis and a brain hemorrhage resulting from torture in prison, and was at least the seventh Tibetan political prisoner reported during the last year to have died, either in prison or following release, from injuries inflicted in custody. He had gone to live and study in exile in India in 1989 and returned to Tibet in 1998 to work as a tour guide, and was widely respected in his community, sources told RFA in an earlier report. Jinpa had also been an important source of information for RFA,on protests in Tibet’s restive Driru county, where Chinese police have clamped down for years on communications to stop politically sensitive information from leaving the region. On May 23, 2013, Jinpa called RFA’s live radio show “Round Table Talk” to inform listeners that at least 5,000 Tibetans were protesting mining activities planned by China on a sacred mountain, Naklha Dzambha, where similar protests had been launched two years before. Mining operations in Tibetan regions have led to frequent standoffs with Tibetans who accuse Chinese firms of disrupting sites of spiritual significance and polluting the environment as they extract local wealth for shipment back to China. And on Nov. 13 that same year, Jinpa again called RFA to say that three Tibetans had been arrested in Driru for putting up posters drawing attention to the conditions of Tibetans lives’ under Beijing’s rule and calling for Tibetan freedom. The arrests followed a wave of detentions in the area of Tibetans resisting forced displays of loyalty to the Chinese state, including orders by authorities to fly the Chinese national flag from their homes. Villagers had refused to fly the flags, throwing them instead into a river, prompting a deadly crackdown in October in which security forces fired on protesters in Driru’s Sengthang and Trinring villages, leaving four dead and at least 50 injured, sources said. Suspected by police of contacting RFA and other foreign news outlets, Jinpa was later arrested by Chinese police and sentenced to a 21-year prison term of which he served less than half before his death. Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.

Gangbu Rikgye Nyima, aged around 30, was freed on Feb. 25 in Draggo (Chinese, Luhuo) county in Sichuan’s Kardze (Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Golok Jigme—a former political prisoner living in exile in Switzerland—told RFA this week. “However, like other political prisoners [released before him], Nyima’s condition is very severe,” Jigme said, citing sources in the region. Nyima and his cellmates, some of whom had been arrested with him in 2012, had repeatedly protested in prison, and were tortured many times by their guards, Jigme said. “He was also put into a dark cell many times, as a result of which his vision is weak, and he suffers constantly from headaches. His lungs and spine are also in a bad state, and he is now mentally disturbed.” Nyima was formerly employed in a hydropower station in Draggo county and was one of many Tibetans detained for peacefully protesting against Chinese rule in Tibetan areas at the time of the Tibetan New Year in Draggo and Serta (Seda) counties, Jigme said. “Even though he was later sentenced to 10 years in prison by the Chinese government, he was released on Feb. 25 after completing only nine years of his sentence,” Jigme said, adding that police took Nyima directly to his home after completing the paperwork for his release, and that family members were warned by police not to come to the police station to receive him. Tibetan political prisoners suffering ill health are sometimes freed in critical condition before the end of their terms, with at least seven reported during the last year to have died—either in prison or following their release—from injuries inflicted under torture in custody, sources say. In a statement written by Nyima and obtained by RFA’s Tibetan Service, Nyima greeted his family following his release, adding, “I will never forget for as long as I live how the Chinese government put me behind bars and tortured me on false charges, and tore away all my human rights.” “Never forget what it means to be a Tibetan,” he said. “Don’t be discouraged, remain united, and always study your language and your religion. We all must be free from this repression.” Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.

While Javed said Kohli has a better range of shots as compared to Babar, he lacks the correct technique against swing bowlers. “Virat Kohli has a better range [of shots] as compared to Babar Azam but he also has one area of weakness. If the ball swings, he tends to get trapped around the off-stump such as against [James] Anderson in England,” said Javed in an interview with Cricket Pakistan. “When you look at Babar, you don’t see any weak areas. Just like, [Sachin] Tendulkar who also didn’t have any weak areas. Babar is technically more safe and sound but if he follows Kohli’s fitness routine he will become an even better player. Meanwhile, Kohli can improve his t9echnique by looking at Babar so that he doesn’t get trapped,” he added.  Interestingly, this is the same Virat Kohli, who has scored 70 international centuries with the same technique and has been one of the faces of the Indian batting unit for a decade. No wonder social media is having a crack over Javed's latest comments. Javed went on to heap praise on Babar for being the mainstay of Pakistan batting line-up over the past couple of years.  “During the past two or three years, Babar Azam is 50 per cent of Pakistan’s batting. I never thought that he would be this consistent and even go past Virat Kohli [in ODI rankings].

In big moments of the game, particularly last year, you would throw Sunil the ball, or you would get him in with the bat because he has been in that situation over and over again. \"He believes in himself and in the team to go and get through and win that situation,\" he signed off.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/10/16/165212-untitled-design-14.jpg?itok=aFPXUjGu\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162243", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22561", "source": "scrapy"},

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162241", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45259", "source": "scrapy"},

On Tuesday, the Women for Society Association sent a request to City Hall in the capital Phnom Penh to lead a march Friday of  200 participants to Hun Sen’s cabinet office, where the group planned to call for government assistance on rent, debt, utility bills, and the cost of gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak after a year-long economic shutdown of the economy. However, the request was rebuffed, and the group said it would honor the local government’s order. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Since then, five people have died as a result of the disease caused by the virus and restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of the outbreak have decimated the impoverished country’s economy. Speaking to RFA’s Khmer Service on Wednesday, Women for Society Association President Keo Tithlida said that while her group no longer plans to lead a march of supporters to Hun Sen’s cabinet office, she plans to petition the prime minister herself. “City Hall said if we proceed with the march, we will be opposing the law,” she said. “We are not in opposition to the municipal authorities … I am willing to go alone, as long as the petition reaches the [central] government.” While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. By Wednesday, the number of infections had climbed to 1,817. Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association (IDEA) President Vorn Pov told RFA that the government needs to do more to help those in need, echoing several of the Women for Society Association’s demands. “The government should consider providing people daily sustenance, stimulus checks like neighboring countries, free utilities, and intervene in loan debts,” he said. Phnom Penh’s refusal to allow the Women for Society Association to march later this week came as representatives of around 100 scavengers who rely on what they can pick out of the city’s dumpsters told RFA that their hardships have become even more pronounced due to coronavirus restrictions. One scavenger named Bun Mann said that quarantine rules have prevented her children, who recently returned to Cambodia from neighboring Thailand where they labored as migrant workers, from seeking employment back home. “It is very difficult to earn a living during the coronavirus,” she said, adding that she has been forced to take on extra work to support her family. A taxi driver in Siem Reap named Kim Nai told RFA that he had been out of work for a year because no tourists are coming to the area to visit Angkor Wat. He said he had been forced to scavenge, picking up snails and crabs from local rice fields to buy food. “It’s been very quiet, with no tourists,” he said. “Before the coronavirus, I could barely make enough, but now it is even worse. I have no steady income.” Kim Nai said that if he is lucky, he can earn between 5,000 and 10,000 riel (U.S. $1.25 and $2.50) a day, although he often does not have enough rice to eat because he can’t find enough to scavenge. Another taxi driver in Siem Reap named Pok Tho said the decline in tourists also caused him to give up driving. Instead, he said, he now raises chickens and ducks to earn a living. “As someone who relies on tourists, I’ve been left with no income,” he said. “To be honest, if I have enough food in the morning, I won’t have enough in the evening.” Pok Tho said he hopes to find a job in construction but has yet to do so. According to the  , Cambodia Association of Travel Agents (CATA) president Chhay Sivlin said Tuesday that the prolonged pandemic had devastated Cambodia’s tourism industry, warranting government support. Cambodia’s Ministry of Tourism has said that from January to March last year, Cambodia hosted 1.16 million international tourists, a decrease of 38 percent over the same period a year earlier. In the second quarter of 2020, the number of tourists had dropped by 90 percent. Angkor Enterprise, the agency that sells tickets to the Angkor Wat complex, said that slightly more than 400,000 people visited the site over the past two months—a decline of 99 percent from a year ago. Hotel manager Eang Chhal told RFA that around 200 five-star hotels had been forced to close their doors during the pandemic, while several other tourism-related businesses had also been shuttered, but the cost of meat and vegetables is up. Ministry of Tourism recently announced that it will waive fines for tourist businesses that have yet to apply for licenses until the end of the year, after around 30 percent filed for closure or suspension of operations.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/relief-03242021165239.html/cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020-1.jpg/@@images/3628f6f5-207e-414d-8841-4aa8588c5d19.jpeg\" title=\"cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162245", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12570", "source": "scrapy"},

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday.   In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm. Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162245", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18003", "source": "scrapy"},

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162245", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47703", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162246", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54753", "source": "scrapy"},

Glenn Cowan, who missed a bus for his own team, accidentally boarded a bus for Chinese players, which led to a domino of events that saw the normalization of the China-US relationship. Photo: Collected ", "text": "\"We were on the bus and were talking and laughing,\" Zhang, now 80, told AFP. \"But when we realised that an American had come onto the bus, we fell silent.\" The Chinese triple world champion Zhuang Zedong eventually came forward and famously broke the ice, giving Cowan a silk embroidery as a souvenir from China. They did not know it at the time, but it was the spark for China and the United States to begin normalising relations, in what became known as 'ping-pong diplomacy'. Zhang, a doubles world champion and later China's coach, recalled: \"Mr. Zhuang understood that there was a difference between the American people and the American government, and that we should be nice to American people, so he took the initiative to chat with Glenn.\" Photographers captured Zhuang and a 19-year-old Cowan shaking hands and smiling. \"The newspaper came out the next day and it seemed that China and the United States were about to have a relationship,\" said Zhang. Days later, on April 10, 1971 the US team became the first Americans to step foot in China for nearly a quarter of a century when they were invited to play friendly matches in the country. The thaw saw President Richard Nixon visit China in February 1972, and a Chinese table tennis squad visit the US. In 1979 formal relations were established between the two countries. Yao Zhenxu played Cowan, who died in 2004, during the Americans' ground-breaking trip. Yao still remembers the score, he won 21-12, 21-14, and says that Cowan thanked him afterwards for \"a serious game\". The American team were vastly inferior to the Chinese, so the hosts sometimes let their visitors win points in the spirit of sportsmanship and goodwill. Now 74, Yao says that it was only afterwards that he realised that he had played a part in something historic. \"Because of ping-pong diplomacy we changed the world order, and the people of China and the United States started friendly exchanges,\" he said. Yao appeared alongside Zhang in Shanghai on Saturday to mark 50 years of ping-pong diplomacy, with the city authorities hosting an event with speeches and friendly amateur matches. But the anniversary comes at a time when relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated markedly over a number of issues, notably trade, the fate of China's Uyghur minority and a clampdown in Hong Kong. In a recorded speech to mark the 50th anniversary, China's ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, accused some in the US of \"ideological bias and zero-sum thinking\". But he and Chinese state media took a largely positive tone, with Xinhua news agency hailing ping-pong diplomacy's \"wonderful legacy\". Yao and Zhang hope that the spirit of 1971 can help shape future relations between the world's top two economies for the better. \"Everyone knows that the relationship between China and the United States is a bit tense nowadays,\" said Yao. \"We hope that we can agree to disagree and keep friendly relations. \"Don't be afraid of competition, we can compete peacefully.\"", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-very-big-1\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/feature/images/2021/04/12/ice.jpg?itok=8GH7YHYw\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162246", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17806", "source": "scrapy"},

Under pressure from authorities, the group had already canceled plans to lead a march to Hun Sen’s cabinet office in Phnom Penh, where they had planned to call for government payments to the millions of Cambodians left jobless as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Keo Thithlida, president of the Women for Society Association, and six other youths were held overnight by Stung Meanchey I district police and released next day after putting their thumbprints on a document handed to them by police, Yean Raksa—a member of the association’s board of directors—told RFA on Thursday. “They told me very briefly that they will now suspend their campaign and that they don’t want to talk about it,” Yean Raksa said. “I don’t know if they were simply told to do this or if they were pressured in some way.” “What I can see is that they are afraid,” he said. RFA could not reach the detained youths for comment, but the association later asked local media not to use any information in its reporting not taken from the group’s own Facebook page. “We don’t want to become a political tool,” Yean Raksa said. “We don’t want to see any allegations [made against us] of political motivations or ill will. We are youth with clean hands,” he added. Reached for comment, Phnom Penh Municipality Police spokesperson San Sokseiha declined to discuss the youths’ detention and release, saying he had no information about the case and was too busy to speak. But Ny Sokha, a spokesperson for the Cambodian rights group Adhoc, said the youths had not committed any crime. Forcing people to place their thumbprints on documents in exchange for their release is illegal and a violation of people’s rights, he said. “They were waging a normal [campaign],” he said. “They were seeking support because we live in a democratic world, and they should be allowed to express their views.” Many Cambodians are now struggling to pay their debts and meet the costs of rent, utility bills, and gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 after an already year-long shutdown of the economy. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day after the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Since then, five people have died as a result of the disease. While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. By Wednesday, the number of infections had climbed to 1,817. A court in Phnom Penh has meanwhile charged a Cambodian man in a first case of “tampering” under the provisions of a new law forbidding criticism of the Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccine.

In an advertisement that hit the screens on Friday afternoon, just before the start of Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021, Dravid has managed to leave everyone shocked with his new avatar while becoming the talk of the town. The ad has gone viral like a wildfire with the 48-year-old former cricketer becoming the top-ranked trending topic on social media platform Twitter.

However, in the very next ball, Prasad cleaned him up and gave him a roaring send-off.  India went on to stage a comeback and defend the target of 287 runs to go into the semifinals of the World Cup.  The ad has resulted in memes flooding the internet as love and admiration for Dravid was seen all over social media platforms. The fact that Dravid doesn't do many ads caught everyone by surprise and his new avatar was the icing on the cake for everyone.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2021/04/11/191010-untitled-design-100.jpg?itok=89EVTdmd\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162245", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22176", "source": "scrapy"},

The record of most sixes in an IPL match stands with Chris Gayle, who smashed 17 sixes against Pune Warriors in 2013 when he was with Royal Challengers Bangalore at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Gayle had hammered 175 not-out in that knock.  Speaking to ESPNcricinfo, Jos Buttler was asked a few questions regarding the IPL 2021. One of which was “Which IPL record would you like to break?” “Most sixes in a match,” Jos Buttler replied. While Buttler is regarded as one of the most dangerous batsmen in white-ball cricket, hitting 17 sixes in an IPL match is a challenge that should sit well with the England batsman. However, the most sixes Buttler has hit in an IPL innings is seven during his 89-run knock against Chennai Super Kings in 2019. Buttler is likely to open for Rajasthan Royals in IPL 2021 and with smaller grounds in India, he would look to achieve the record if he gets it going from the word go. The swashbuckling batsman said that “variety” is the strength of the Rajasthan Royals. Royals would be looking to win the trophy for the first time since IPL 2008 and with Sanju Samson set to lead the side, the Rajasthan outfit would be looking for a fresh start with new ideas.

The 1.5 million doses of Sinopharm’s Sinovac vaccination, purchased by Prime Minister Hun Sen’s government for around U.S. $15 million, were delivered to Cambodia as the number of people infected with COVID-19 in the country rose to nearly 2,000. Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wentian announced during a reception ceremony for the vaccines that China had sold the doses to Phnom Penh as part of a “special deal” and said he hopes the injections will help protect the country from the coronavirus. He said China will continue to assist Cambodia with vaccine supplies if the outbreak worsens, adding that there are currently more than 60 countries using the Sinovac injection. Cambodia’s Finance Secretary of State Vongsey Visoth told reporters at the ceremony that the government is seeking to buy additional vaccines from India and the U.S. but lauded the country’s special ties to China that had allowed for Friday’s delivery. “The solid steel relationship between Cambodia and China played a vital role in securing vaccine for our country in a timely manner,” he said. While Hun Sen did not take part in the reception ceremony, he posted a comment on his Facebook account saying that Cambodia is in negotiations to purchase around 4 million doses of Sinovac as part of a government push to vaccinate 10 million people, or more than two-thirds of the country’s population. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day after the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Since then, eight people have died as a result of the disease, with the eighth death recorded on Friday. While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. Rollbacks on democracy, including the disbanding of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), that led Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win the country’s election in a landslide in 2018 have led Western nations to increasingly shun Phnom Penh in recent years, while Chinese influence has grown in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation. While Beijing has showered aid on Cambodia, many Cambodians worry about China’s increasing presence in their country’s affairs and have even expressed wariness over the quality of its vaccines. On Friday, political analyst Kim Sok told RFA’s Khmer Service that the Sinovac vaccine doesn’t measure up to vaccines from the West that have earned the recognition of the World Health Organization (WHO). “Hun Sen’s government should have spent money on vaccines recognized by the WHO,” he said. “People have more trust in those vaccines.” Meanwhile, residents living in areas locked down as part of a bid to restrict the spread of the coronavirus in Cambodia urged the government Friday to provide special aid packages to help them during the outbreak. Many Cambodians are now struggling to pay their debts and meet the costs of rent, utility bills, and gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 after an already year-long shutdown of the economy that killed the tourism and entertainment industries. A villager from Siem Reap province named Yim Sogna told RFA that authorities in his district began enforcing the lockdown about a week ago and said he no longer earns an income. He accused the government of failing to address the needs of villagers. “How can we afford the cost of living for a 14-day quarantine,” he asked. “We’ve spent the money we made, but we need to pay the bank too. I call on the government to help the people.” Another villager in the seat of Sihanoukville province, who is also living in a locked down area, told RFA that work had dried up and he is in risk of defaulting on a loan he took to buy a motor taxi, and pay for his rent and utilities. “My situation is getting worse,” he said. “The government must intervene with the banks to suspend loan repayments for a few months.” Ministry of Finance spokesman Meas Soksensan refused to comment when contacted by RFA. Ny Sokha of local rights group Adhoc told RFA that the government needs to not only pay attention to fighting the coronavirus, but also the living standards of the people. He urged the government to release a stimulus package to subsidize those who have lost their incomes. “The government must resolve this posthaste,” he said. On Thursday, the World Bank issued a report which said that more than a year into the pandemic, the economies of East and Asia and the Pacific are facing a “markedly uneven recovery.” According to the Bank, only China and Vietnam are experiencing a V-shaped rebound where output has already surpassed pre-pandemic levels. “In the other major economies, output remained on average around 5 percent below pre-pandemic levels,” the report said. “Economic performance has depended on the effectiveness of virus containment, the ability to take advantage of the revival of international trade, and the capacity of governments to provide fiscal and monetary support.” On Friday, Cambodia’s Finance Ministry spokesman Meas Soksensan told RFA that the government had come to the same conclusion as the Bank, acknowledging that it has been “difficult” for Cambodia’s economy to grow during the pandemic. “The findings are normal because of the impact of the coronavirus,” he said, adding that Cambodia “cannot hope to achieve the same economic growth as before the pandemic.” “I hope that the global economy will recover because some countries have already developed vaccines and are now supplying them to the world.”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162246", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12646", "source": "scrapy"},

As we mourn his passing, we remember the significant and remarkable life that he had led, dedicated first and foremost to service to the United Kingdom and its people, as well as to the peoples of the Commonwealth and the world at large. He had an indomitable spirit, fighting for peace and justice in the Second World War in his early years, and later steadfastly pursuing environmental causes, where he was well ahead of the times, and taking a close interest in sports and education. His selfless devotion to service has contributed much to advance and uplift the livelihoods of people in the United Kingdom and within the Commonwealth. We will also remember him for his steadfast support of Her Majesty The Queen.  One of his distinguished achievements was the creation of The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme over six decades ago. The awards nurtured and empowered young people to gain the skills, confidence and resilience to become exceptional individuals who can make a difference and contribute to society. The scheme also inspired Singapore’s own National Youth Achievement Award programme, which was launched in 1992. It was clear that the Duke of Edinburgh made education an utmost priority. He visited the National University of Singapore in 1972, and the United World College of Southeast Asia in 1989.

Throughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day. We have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh’s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959. The Duke of Edinburgh’s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.

Both incidents took place in Cooch Behar of North Bengal, the BJP’s stronghold. The Election Commission said that the CISF had to fire in order to save lives of voters who came to vote, put in place certain restrictions, including extending the \"silence period\" from 48 hours to 72 hours for the fifth phase of polling West Bengal. It also barred the entry of politicians in Cooch Behar district for the next 72 hours to prevent any possible law and order flare-up.   The shocking incident took place at around 10.30 am when a group of TMC workers stormed a polling booth (No. 126) at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra in Shitalkuchi Assembly constituency. Facing their attack, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) troopers, who were guarding the booth, fired on the mob and shot dead four persons — Hamidul Haque, Monirul Haque, Samiul Mian and Amjad Hossain — while injuring three others.  According to the CISF, the mob of around 150 first manhandled the polling staff at the booth.

In the meantime, a quick response team of the CISF and police also reached the spot. The mob further started advancing aggressively towards CISF personnel. Therefore, sensing imminent danger to their life, they fired seven more rounds towards the advancing mob of miscreants. While the above incident was going on, more police parties also arrived at the booth. It is reported that in self-defence they have also fired a few rounds,\" the CISF said.   Polling was stopped immediately by the EC.  The CISF's justification of \"self-defence\" was supported by the district police and administration in its preliminary report to the EC which, issuing the CISF a clean chit later, said, \"Recourse to open fire by CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save lives of voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as mob had attempted to snatch their weapons.\" The TMC, however, described the shooting as “cold-blooded murder\" of its workers in its complaint to Chief Electoral Officer West Bengal Ariz Aftab. Spewing venom against the Central forces and Union home minister Amit Shah, an angry chief minister flew to Siliguri and announced that the Criminal Investigation Department would probe the killings.    The TMC chief is likely to visit the kin of the deceased on Sunday though the EC has banned the entry of any politician of any level in Shitalkuchi.  The tragic incident follows party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee's recent statements that the Central forces were acting in a biased manner at the behest of the BJP and asking voters to gherao them. On Saturday, her party landed in the dock after its workers shot dead a first-time voter, Ananda Burman (18), in the same district. The teenaged boy was standing in a queue outside a polling booth (No. 285) at Pathantuli Shalbari area when a scuffle broke out between TMC and BJP workers. Another person, close to him, also suffered bullet injuries.   Despite the poll-violence, the 44 seats spread across five districts of West Bengal recorded a voters' turnout of 76.16 per cent on average till 5 pm. While Cooch Behar saw 79.73 per cent polling in nine seats, the figure stood at 73.65 per cent in five of Alipurduar seats, 75.49 per cent in 11 seats of South 24 Parganas, 75.03 per cent in nine seats in Howrah and 76.02 per cent in 10 Hooghly seats.  Updated data is expected from the Election Commission on Sunday. Among the 11 seats in South 24 Parganas, five -- Jadavpur, Kasba, Tollygunge, Behala East and Behala West -- are actually located in Kolkata.  The Election Commission’s order said that in Cooch Behar, comprising nine Assembly constituencies where voting got over on Saturday, no political leader from any national, state or other party should be allowed to enter the geographical boundaries of the district for the next 72 hours.   \"The Election Commission of India further directs that the silence period for phase 5 (i.e. for polls scheduled on April 17) shall be extended to 72 hours and no campaigning shall be permitted during 72 hours before the close of the poll in order to ensure the conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections,\" an EC order said. The silence period is generally for 48 hours.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162245", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17996", "source": "scrapy"},

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.  Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors.   In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.  The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing.   “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said. Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday. In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm.   Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162247", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17750", "source": "scrapy"},

The Central forces gunned down four persons at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar. Another death also happened in the morning. From the very first day I have been vocal. Central forces are not my enemy.

Where did they get so much audacity from? Where do so many atrocities originate from? BJP knows it has lost in the polls. That is why they are killing the voters and workers. What fault did they commit?\" Puncturing the Trinamul Congress supremo's claim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was also in the state for poll campaign in two districts, referred to Ms Banerjee's alleged provocation to attack the Central forces and warned her and her party workers against hooliganism. He mourned the loss of lives and urged the Election Commission for strong punishment for the accused of the killings.   Addressing a BJP rally in Siliguri of North Bengal, Mr Modi said, \"What happened in Coochbehar is very sad. I mourn the loss of lives in the killings. My condolences with their families. Didi and her goons have been panicked to see the support of the people for the BJP. Seeing herself losing the chair, Didi has stooped to such a low level! But I want to make it clear to the TMC, Didi and her goons that their muscle-flexing will not be allowed in Bengal. I request the Election Commission to take stringent action on the accused of the incident.\" He however told Ms Banerjee, \"But your tricks to provoke the people in attacking the Central forces on poll-duty and obstruct the polling process will not be able to save you. Your violence after a decade-long misdeed cannot save you. People are casting their votes in large numbers for BJP. North Bengal has shown it.\"    Standing by the Central forces for their role in the poll duty, Mr Modi observed that the TMC chief, not the forces, has become the biggest trouble in the polls.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162247", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16894", "source": "scrapy"},

In its annual Cambodian Journalism Situation Report, CamboJA said it recorded 35 cases of harassment against 72 journalists in 2020, based on news reports, social media posts, court documents and interviews, and that more than 42 of them were detained for questioning or imprisoned. At least 22 journalists were either attacked or threatened with violence while working, the group said, and one journalist died in what police concluded was a traffic accident without carrying out what it termed a “proper investigation.” According to CamboJA, Cambodian authorities continued to use the threat of legal action to intimidate journalists in 2020, particularly the charges of “incitement to commit felony” or “extortion” under Articles 495 and 232 of the Criminal Code.  As of December, at least 10 journalists remain in prison in the country, eight of whom are in pre-trial detention for criminal charges, it said. “The ongoing imprisonment, detention and physical threats against journalists undermines the media’s role in a democratic society and strikes fear in those who cover stories or cases involving powerful officials,” CamboJA said in its report. “Journalists have generally been unsuccessful when turning to the courts for justice or protection, even when they are able to identify perpetrators such as military police, district security guards, timber traders and cock fighters. This impunity for crimes against journalists compounds the sense of fear and futility for those seeking to expose bad actors inside and outside of government.” Speaking to RFA’s Khmer Service, CamboJA executive director Nop Vy said that in addition to the threat of harassment and arrest, journalists also lack any support from relevant authorities. He also called the overall situation of press freedom in Cambodia in 2020 significantly worse than in previous years. “Pending cases involving journalists related to ethics and their profession as journalists should be dropped,” he said. “Stop filing lawsuits against them because all these cases create an environment of fear that impacts press freedom.” Ministry of Information Meas Sophorn responded to the claims in the report by saying that journalists in Cambodia “enjoy freedom of the press” and suggesting that certain NGOs were “not reporting the truth” about the situation. “In accordance with the law, they can fulfill the requirements of their profession freely and fully in the Kingdom of Cambodia,” he told RFA “There are many journalists working in the profession, and the number is increasing. However, journalists working in Cambodia are held accountable. If a journalist commits a crime, he must be held accountable before the law.” Media director of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media (CCIM), Ith Sothoeut, told RFA that when authorities use the criminal code to arrest journalists it forces them to self-censor. Ith Sothoeut called on the authorities to apply the country’s Press Law in support of journalists who report on the shortcomings of powerful officials and other problems in society. “As CambodJa mentioned in its report, so far, the Press Law has not been enforced in nearly all cases involving journalists,” he said. “On the contrary, the criminal code has been applied, which is unfortunate for journalists.” Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin—who had worked as an editor, reporter and news anchor, and a photographer and videographer for RFA’s Khmer Service, respectively—were taken into custody in November 2017. They remain out on bail but in legal limbo after a series of appeals have been rejected by courts. They were charged with “illegally collecting information for a foreign source” after RFA closed its bureau in the capital in September that year and were slapped with additional charges for illegally produced pornography in March 2018. If convicted of the first charge, they could face a jail term of between seven and 15 years. Paris-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Cambodia 144  out of 180 nations in its 2020 World Press Freedom Index, down from 143  a year earlier, citing a crackdown on independent media in the lead up to the country’s 2018 general election. The crackdown on the independent media came amid a wider attack by Prime Minister Hun Sen on the political opposition and NGOs that paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats up for grab in the ballot.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162247", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12106", "source": "scrapy"},

The Bangladesh Bank had shortened the banking hours from 10:00 am to 12:30 pm on April 4, after the government announced a lockdown-like restriction, banning transport movement and closing shops for a week from April 5.  But the coronavirus situation has not improved. Instead, the number of infections and deaths is rising alarmingly. This prompted the government to come up with a strict countrywide lockdown from April 14.   Bankers of Sonali Bank, Southeast Bank, and South Bangla Agriculture and Commerce said many clients apprehended that banks might remain closed during the all-out lockdown. Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader and State Minister for Public Administration Farhad Hossain on Friday said that the government was considering a strict lockdown for a week from April 14. This has created the rush at the banks' premises to withdraw money as people feel comfortable keeping cash at hand at the time of crisis. Yesterday's BB notice did not say anything about the banking hours during the strict lockdown period. However, several central bankers have ruled out any closure of banks and suggested people not be worried. The central bank is working to keep available cash at automated teller machines. Customers will also avail of banking services through digital platforms from anywhere and anytime. The central bank has already increased the transaction ceiling under the booming mobile financial service (MFS) during the lockdown. A client can now send Tk 200,000 per month instead of the previous ceiling of Tk 75,000. Besides, people will not count any charge in sending a maximum of Tk 40,000 per month. Clients are allowed to send Tk 10,000 per transaction without any cost. Earlier, an individual was charged Tk 5 to send money to another person.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-6\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/2021/04/12/bb.jpg?itok=wM8Mm6TR&amp;c=045de2562d02912e738906da3d6da48c\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162246", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17092", "source": "scrapy"},

Both incidents took place in Cooch Behar of North Bengal, the BJP’s stronghold. The Election Commission said that the CISF had to fire in order to save lives of voters who came to vote, put in place certain restrictions, including extending the \"silence period\" from 48 hours to 72 hours for the fifth phase of polling West Bengal. It also barred the entry of politicians in Cooch Behar district for the next 72 hours to prevent any possible law and order flare-up.   The shocking incident took place at around 10.30 am when a group of TMC workers stormed a polling booth (No. 126) at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra in Shitalkuchi Assembly constituency. Facing their attack, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) troopers, who were guarding the booth, fired on the mob and shot dead four persons — Hamidul Haque, Monirul Haque, Samiul Mian and Amjad Hossain — while injuring three others.  According to the CISF, the mob of around 150 first manhandled the polling staff at the booth. Sources said they were not “armed”, but some were carrying bamboo sticks. \"The CISF booth commander tried to pacify the miscreants but the mob entered the polling booth and beat up the other polling staff on duty. Few miscreants tried to snatch the weapons of CISF personnel deployed there. As a result, CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air but the mob did not pay any heed to the warning. In the meantime, a quick response team of the CISF and police also reached the spot. The mob further started advancing aggressively towards CISF personnel. Therefore, sensing imminent danger to their life, they fired seven more rounds towards the advancing mob of miscreants. While the above incident was going on, more police parties also arrived at the booth. It is reported that in self-defence they have also fired a few rounds,\" the CISF said.   Polling was stopped immediately by the EC.  The CISF's justification of \"self-defence\" was supported by the district police and administration in its preliminary report to the EC which, issuing the CISF a clean chit later, said, \"Recourse to open fire by CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save lives of voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as mob had attempted to snatch their weapons.\" The TMC, however, described the shooting as “cold-blooded murder\" of its workers in its complaint to Chief Electoral Officer West Bengal Ariz Aftab. Spewing venom against the Central forces and Union home minister Amit Shah, an angry chief minister flew to Siliguri and announced that the Criminal Investigation Department would probe the killings.    The TMC chief is likely to visit the kin of the deceased on Sunday though the EC has banned the entry of any politician of any level in Shitalkuchi.  The tragic incident follows party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee's recent statements that the Central forces were acting in a biased manner at the behest of the BJP and asking voters to gherao them. On Saturday, her party landed in the dock after its workers shot dead a first-time voter, Ananda Burman (18), in the same district. The teenaged boy was standing in a queue outside a polling booth (No. 285) at Pathantuli Shalbari area when a scuffle broke out between TMC and BJP workers. Another person, close to him, also suffered bullet injuries.   Despite the poll-violence, the 44 seats spread across five districts of West Bengal recorded a voters' turnout of 76.16 per cent on average till 5 pm. While Cooch Behar saw 79.73 per cent polling in nine seats, the figure stood at 73.65 per cent in five of Alipurduar seats, 75.49 per cent in 11 seats of South 24 Parganas, 75.03 per cent in nine seats in Howrah and 76.02 per cent in 10 Hooghly seats.  Updated data is expected from the Election Commission on Sunday. Among the 11 seats in South 24 Parganas, five -- Jadavpur, Kasba, Tollygunge, Behala East and Behala West -- are actually located in Kolkata.  The Election Commission’s order said that in Cooch Behar, comprising nine Assembly constituencies where voting got over on Saturday, no political leader from any national, state or other party should be allowed to enter the geographical boundaries of the district for the next 72 hours.   \"The Election Commission of India further directs that the silence period for phase 5 (i.e. for polls scheduled on April 17) shall be extended to 72 hours and no campaigning shall be permitted during 72 hours before the close of the poll in order to ensure the conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections,\" an EC order said. The silence period is generally for 48 hours.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162247", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17902", "source": "scrapy"},

Dallas opened the scoring three minutes before half-time, but hope of a famous win for Marcelo Bielsa's men seemed to have disappeared when captain Liam Cooper was shown a straight red card in first-half stoppage time. The visitors withstood a City bombardment until Ferran Torres equalised 14 minutes from time. But Leeds still summoned the energy to pose a threat on the counter-attack and gained their reward when Dallas slotted below Ederson. Bielsa's first win in five meetings against Pep Guardiola propels Leeds to ninth in their first season back in the English top flight for 16 years. Guardiola paid for heavily rotating his side with Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, second leg, against Borussia Dortmund clearly his priority. City still enjoy a 14-point lead at the top of the Premier League and need just 11 points from their remaining six matches to guarantee a third title in four years. But Manchester United could close the gap to eight points should the Red Devils win their two games in hand, the first of which is away to Tottenham on Sunday. A two-minute silence was held before kick-off in honour of Prince Philip, who died aged 99 on Friday. Once the action got underway, City noticeably missed Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan, Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden and Ruben Dias, who were among the stars left on the bench by Guardiola. Raheem Sterling's presence in what was largely a second string side is a reflection of how the England international has fallen down the pecking order in the past few weeks. Sterling did not even get on as a substitute in the first leg against Dortmund and did little to further his case for selection in midweek by slicing a great chance wide from Fernandinho's cut-back. Leeds had wasted a number of promising attacks with their final ball, but found the finishing touch on 43 minutes. Patrick Bamford teed up Dallas to strike low in off the inside the post. The visitors' joy was short-lived. Just four minutes later they were a man down. Cooper played the ball first before crashing into Gabriel Jesus, but referee Andre Marriner upgraded a yellow card shown to the Leeds' captain to a red after reviewing the incident on the pitch-side screen. Bamford was immediately sacrificed for more defensive cover in Pascal Struijk as Leeds battened down the hatches. City were camped inside the Leeds half for almost the entire second-half, but were largely reduced to long-range efforts as Illan Meslier saved from Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fernandinho and Joao Cancelo. Gundogan and Foden were introduced to bring more spark to City's attack, but De Bruyne was surprisingly left in reserve for the full 90 minutes. Torres finally made City's dominance pay with a first-time finish after Fernandinho picked out Silva inside the area. Yet, Leeds still went in search of a winner. Raphinha outpaced Fernandinho, but was denied by a brilliant tackle by Brazilian compatriot Ederson. Leeds' approach was rewarded in stoppage time when Dallas galloped clear down the middle of a vacant City defence to slot home.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2021/04/10/190939-00097q4bq.jpg?itok=xqud7PrP\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162247", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22336", "source": "scrapy"},
