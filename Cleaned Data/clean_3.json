   "text":"Dr.  , who served as former  ’s coronavirus response coordinator, said the White House could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives if it had coordinated better during the onset of the pandemic.  Birx was one of the nation’s top doctors featured in   that broadcast Sunday night about the country’s initial response to the coronavirus, which has left more than   in the U.S. alone. When pressed by host Sanjay Gupta on whether the country could have focused more on mitigation strategies, Birx acknowledged many lives could have been saved. “I look at it this way ― the first time we have an excuse,” Birx said. “There were about 100,000 deaths that came from that original surge. All of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially.” “The federal government did not provide consistent messaging to the American people and that is fault number one,” Birx added later in the interview. Death rates across the country have fallen substantially since the beginning of a vaccination blitz. However, infection rates have   amid national fatigue and the spread of dangerous variants that have gained ground in the U.S. In recent months, Birx has faced criticism for praising Trump’s response to the pandemic even as he spread conspiracy theories or promoted unproven drugs as a potential cure to the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, leveled his own criticism at Birx during the CNN documentary, saying she should have done more to push Trump to act, but added she did “a lot of good” and was in a “difficult situation.” Birx said she was subject to a “very uncomfortable” call from the former president after she appeared on CNN last August to speak about the threats of the virus.  When Gupta asked if she was threatened or censored, she demurred then said someone had blocked her from speaking further on national television. “My understanding was I could not be national because the president might see it,” she said.",

The atmosphere is almost similar to the one witnessed during the 2017 Nandyal Assembly byelection when Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy, then the Leader of Opposition, camped in Nandyal for a week. Similarly, TD chief N.

Subba Reddy and ministers Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy and Narayana Swamy and other leaders took care of gram panchayat, municipal and corporation elections and provided landslide victories. Jagan Mohan Reddy hoping for an overwhelming win has assigned ministers Perni Venkataramaiah alias Nani, P. Anil Kumar, Audimulapu Suresh, Mekapati Gautam Reddy, Kurasala Kannababu, Kodali Venkateswara Rao (Nani) and Balineni Srinivas Reddy to the seven Assembly segments of Tirupati Lok Sabha constituency. They have been coordinating with local MLAs and other leaders to ensure a massive for the party nominee Dr. Gurumoorthy.   The TD has deployed 200 leaders for campaigning, including Naidu, Nara Lokesh, K.

However, in what comes a major blow to their calculations, the actor-politician is in quarantine and there are hardly any days left for campaigning. Meanwhile, leaders from Congress, Communist and other parties are also camping in Tirupati while the entire State is keenly awaiting the verdict at Tirupati.   Political analysts said that TD is following the volunteers system by appointing in-charges for every 50 families and highlighting about YSRC’s corruption, failures and illegalities so that they would vote for their candidate Panabaka Lakshmi. They pointed out that TD has changed its strategy and is accusing the YSRC government of failure in the probe of Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy’s murder and alleging a possible involvement of YSR family in the murder hoping to distract voters from the ruling party. The senior political analysts stated that chances of YSRC winning Tirupati are bright but the ruling party has set a heavy target by hoping for a four to five lakh majority while it won the 2019 elections with a 2.28 lakh majority.   Ramachandra Reddy said that YSRC government is treating Tirupati by-election as a referendum.

   "text":"A group of six North Korean soldiers guarding the Yalu River border with China abandoned their posts and escaped across the river early this month, sources in the North Korean military told RFA. The six soldiers were stationed near at the border in the country’s northern Ryanggang province, near the city of Hyesan. Sources told RFA that their increased work schedule and meager supply since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020 left them hungry and overworked, but authorities have yet to identify the motive for their escape. “On the 3 … six soldiers of the 25th Border Guard brigade escaped with their weapons. It’s caused quite the stir among not only the border security bureau, but also the troops near the Hyesan area,” a military official from Hyesan told RFA’s Korean Service Monday. “The six were on nighttime stakeout at the border on the night of the 2  and did not show up after their scheduled return time in the early morning. A search team combed the entire border area looking for them. It was determined that the six had crossed the river with their weapons and escaped to China,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. Soldiers in the North Korean military are not adequately supplied by the government. It is not uncommon to see soldiers in uniform working on farms to make enough food to supply their unit. But under normal circumstances, soldiers posted at the border are in a relatively privileged situation and can easily find ways to make enough money to support themselves. Many accept bribes to look the other way when smugglers shuttle goods into and out of the country, while others do the smuggling themselves. However, smuggling came to a near halt at the start of coronavirus pandemic. In January 2020, Beijing and Pyongyang shut down the Sino-Korean border and suspended all trade, with disastrous effect on the North Korean economy. To further deter people from crossing the border Pyongyang in the summer established a kill zone, warning that anyone found within one kilometer of the border would be shot on sight. Authorities also ordered border security to lay land mines along some parts of the border and sent special forces to keep a watchful eye on the border guards. “Usually, border guard soldiers are in collusion with professional smugglers and bundle merchants, and they live better than soldiers in other regions. But the coronavirus outbreak has been raging for more than a year, so smuggling has completely stopped, and they are suffering from hunger these days,” the source said. “Both professional and amateur smugglers can’t even approach the border in times like this. There’s a shoot-to-kill order from the General Command, and the intensity of border security is much higher than in the past. The soldiers are all tired,” said the source. Another military source from Ryanggang Tuesday confirmed that the six soldiers from the 25  Brigade had escaped to China by crossing the Yalu River with their automatic rifles. “As this incident was reported to the Central Committee, the area around Hyesan and the border area was completely turned upside down,” said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “Border security command and a search team from the State Security department searched the border area and the city of Hyesan, but they concluded that the six border guard soldiers had already escaped to China,” the second source said. The second source said that the border guards are in such a privileged position that only those with good connections can join their ranks. “They are better supplied, and they can more easily make extra income than other military units. Border guards don’t actually guard the border, they take money from Chinese and North Korean smugglers who illegally cross the border. They lived quite well before the coronavirus,” said the second source. “The soldiers' motives for escaping North Korea are still unknown, but people assume that they either accidentally crossed the river to steal food because they were hungry, or they might have been planning to escape the country and finally executed their plan while on nighttime stakeout duty,” said the second source. The second source said that the border security bureau is in a state of chaos over the escape. One soldier escaping would be a problem, but six escaping together makes the case serious enough that the Central Committee of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party is paying close attention. “The General Command notified the Chinese border guards and requested cooperation in the search and arrest of the escaped soldiers, and China seems to be taking this case very seriously. Since the six soldiers are armed and dangerous, the Chinese guards must be very nervous about what could happen,” said the second source. “Residents of the border area have had a very difficult time making a living in the era of the coronavirus. The escape of the six soldiers has only increased tension in the border area with more frequent and thorough inspections,” the second source said. The six escapees are not the only ones responsible for their escape, according to the second source. “Even if they are caught, their entire company will be disbanded, and their commanders and anyone else involved will have to take responsibility, so it will be a bit of a bloodbath here for a while.”",

   "text":"।  यमुना की सहायक नदी के रूप में जानी जाले वाली करबन को भागीरथ की तलाश है। यह नदी कभी खेतों में खुशहाली बखेरती थी।  पशु-पक्षी इसके पानी से अपनी प्यास बुझाते थे। लेकिन, अब सूखी पड़ी है। कहीं-कहीं तो नाले जैसी नजर आती है। अगर इसकी सफाई करा दी जाए और जगह-जगह डेन बना दिए जाएं तो इसका उद्धार हो सकता है। यह नदी जल संरक्षण में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभा सकेगी।  करबन नदी बुलंदशहर के खुर्जा क्षेत्र से निकल कर अलीगढ़ के गभाना से खैर क्षेत्र में प्रवेश करती है। इगलास होते हुए हाथरस से निकल कर आगरा के एत्मादपुर के समीप युमना में विलय हो जाती है। इस लिए इसे यमुना की सहायक नदी कहा जाता है। कभी इन क्षेत्रों में हजारों एकड़ भूमि को सींचती थी लेकिन आज सूखी पड़ी है। सिर्फ बारिश के समय ही नदी के आंचल में पानी की धारा नजर आती है। अलीगढ़ जिले में ही नदी की लंबाई लगभग 70 किलो मीटर है। पहले बहती हुई नदी क्षेत्र के वाटर लेवल को रिचार्ज करने का काम करती थी, लेकिन आज इसके आस-पास का क्षेत्र डार्क जान घोषित किया जा चुका है। नदी में जल न होने के कारण क्षेत्र को डार्क जॉन से नहीं उवार पा रही। नदी के संरक्षण के लिए लोगों को आगे आना होगा। \n  करबन नदी में काफी जगहों पर खोले गए नाले नदी को दूषित कर रहे हैं। इन नालों के कारण कुछ स्थानों पर नाले के रूप में नजर आती है। नदी में जलीय पौधों की भरमार है। कभी लोगों के साथ जीव-जंतुओं की प्रयास इस नदी के जल से बुझती थी। अब इसका पानी इतना दूषित है कि इसमें रहने वाले जलचर भी विलुप्त हो चले हैं। इससे आसपास के जलस्रोत भी दूषित होने लगे हैं। \n  करबन नदी अलीगढ़ जिले की सबसे लंबी नदी है। इगलास, खैर, सादाबाद, चंडौस आदि कस्बों सहित काफी संख्या में गांव इस नदी के किनारे बसे हुए हैं। सरकारी सिस्टम ने इस नदी की कद्र नहीं जानी और आज नदी अपना अस्तित्व खोती जा रही है। कहीं-कहीं तो नदी काफी सकरी हो गई है। गांव तलेसरा के पास सायफन बना हुआ है। यहां नदी के ऊपर से गंग नहर बहती है। नहर से नदी में पानी छोड़े जाने की व्यवस्था है लेकिन पानी छोड़ा नहीं जाता है। \n  पहले नदी में स्वच्छ पानी 12 माह बहता था। नहाने व अन्य घरेलू कार्यों के लिए लोग नदी के पानी का इस्तेमाल करते थे। बरसात के दिनों में तो नदी उफान पर होती थी और खेतों में भी पानी भर जाता था। 20 साल पहले नदी साफ व स्वच्छ थी। अब तो नदी में जलकुंभी, जलीय पौधे नजर आते हैं। सरकारी मशीनरी की उदासीनता के चलते नदी अपना अस्तित्व खोती जा रही है। \n  पहले करबन नदी खेतों की सिंचाई का प्रमुख साधन थी। अब तो अन्य नदियों के तरह इस नदी को अस्तित्व भी खतरे में है। सिर्फ बरसात के दिनों में पानी नजर आता है। जब हम छोटे थे तो करबन नदी में नहाने जाते थे। अब नदी में पानी नहीं है। सफाई न होने से गंदगी भी रहती है। नदी में पानी न होने से क्षेत्र के भूमिगत जलश्रोत भी घटते जा रहे हैं। \n \n",

   "text":"The world is increasingly falling into the grip of COVID-19, the pandemic which has claimed over 69,000 lives globally. The epicentre has shifted continents twice, first from China in Asia to European countries like Italy, and then to North America - the United States. Currently, the US has over 300,000 active cases of the virus, with over 8,000 reported deaths. The toll is expected to increase over the next few weeks before the virus heats its peak in the country. However, many religious congregations are defying the lockdown and social distancing directives.  In the US state of Louisiana, “Palm Sunday” was celebrated over the weekend. And the coronavirus didn’t stop a suburban church! Palm Sunday refers to the beginning of holy week among Christian churches. The Life Tabernacle Church defied the stay-at-home orders on Sunday, with the pastor, Tony Spell telling people that there was “nothing to fear but fear itself.” Besides this, across the area, gatherings of over 1,000 people have been happening in full-swing! “We’re defying the rules because the commandment of God is to spread the Gospel,” Louisiana pastor Tony Spell said on Saturday. The state of Louisiana has become one of the virus hotspots in the region, with over 400 deaths and 13,000 active cases. “They would rather come to church and worship like free people than live like prisoners in their homes,” Spell further said. Even when the majority of churches have been holding services online, many churches continue to defy the orders, in different states like Florida, Texas, California. “Satan’s trying to keep us apart, he’s trying to keep us from worshipping together. But we’re not going to let him win,” Kelly Burton, the pastor at Lone Star Baptist Church in Lone Star, Texas, said on Facebook.   Even the chronic denier of coronavirus, President Donald Trump recently warned that “there’s going to be a lot of death” in the country, and asked the citizens to prepare for a big surge in deaths. As per data from White House, over 1,00,000 to 2,40,000 Americans could be killed due to the pandemic, even with lockdowns in place. The state of New York remains the hardest-hit, the number of deaths rising everyday, and medical supplies quickly running out!",

They really missed the call. They could have called it months earlier,\" he said. Trump has been widely criticized for initially downplaying the virus, which he likened to the ordinary flu and said was under control in the United States, before later accepting that it was a national emergency.",

   "text":"A new report claims that the number of coronavirus infections in the United States will spike during the summer if lockdown measures are not properly enforced. The New York Times reported that if the stay-at-home orders are retracted before 30 days, the virus could resurge. The estimated death toll would further jump to 200,000 in case the lockdown measures are withdrawn too quickly in a bid to resume economic activity. The NYT had received the estimate from the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Health and Human Services.   The president has claimed that he is unaware of any such projections. Recently, Trump drew flak for tweeting “Happy Good Friday” while the rest of the country mourns, as the US is expected to overtake Italy in terms of the number of reported deaths. He additionally claimed that the country is headed towards the infection peak, with expected loss of lives projected at 100,000. The coronavirus pandemic has now killed over 100,000 around the world, AFP reported. This coincided with the festival of Easter whereby churches remained empty across the world as people were advised to stay at home to practice social distancing. A few days ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) had claimed how lifting lockdowns too early could lead to a second wave and would be a catastrophe. The report also claimed that if lockdown measures weren’t enforced, the death toll would have jumped to 300,000. The measures in question include shutting down institutions like schools and practicing social distancing. As of now, 25 per cent of the US is working from home. And the NYT is very confident that the number will shoot up to 200,000 if the restrictions are eased before 30 days.",

   "text":" New Caledonia refuses to be independent from France. The South Pacific archipelago of New Caledonia voted against independence from France on Sunday for the second time in as many years, a provisional final count showed. A French flag flutters in the sky over the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, December 10, 2018. A surprise “yes” vote would have deprived Paris of a foothold in a region where China is expanding its influence, and dented the pride of a colonial power whose reach once spanned large parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The “no” vote won 53.26% of votes cast votes, a narrower margin of victory than in the 2018 poll. The result will bring relief to President Emmanuel Macron’s government, whose attention had been focused on the coronavirus pandemic in the run-up to the referendum. “Voters have had their say. They confirmed their wish to keep New Caledonia a part of France. As head of state, I salute this show of confidence in the Republic with a profound feeling of gratitude,” Macron said in a televised statement. New Caledonia became a French colony in 1853. Tensions have long run deep between pro-independence indigenous Kanaks and descendants of colonial settlers who remain loyal to Paris. Sunday’s referendum was the second of up to three permitted under the terms of the 1998 Noumea Accord, an agreement enshrined in France’s constitution and which set out a 20-year path towards decolonisation. France stood ready to organise a further vote within two years if that was the wish of New Caledonians, at which point both sides would have to accept the result, Macron said. “We have two years to look to the future,” the president continued. The island chain already enjoys a large degree of autonomy but depends heavily on France for matters such as defence and education. Turnout was high at 85.6% of eligible voters – after a stronger-than-expected independence vote in the 2018 referendum. New Caledonia lies some 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Australia and 20,000 km (12,500 miles) from Paris. Under French colonial rule the Kanaks were confined to reserves and excluded from much of the island’s economy. The first revolt erupted in 1878, not long after the discovery of large nickel deposits that are today exploited by French miner Eramet’s subsidiary SLN. Today, its economy is underpinned by annual French subsidies of some 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) and nickel deposits that are estimated to represent 25% of the world’s total, and tourism. The territory has, however, largely cut itself off from the outside world to shield itself from the coronavirus. It has registered only 27 cases of COVID-19. For a third referendum to take place, a third of the local assembly in New Caledonia must vote in favour of one.",

   "text":"Anti-semitism is hostility to, prejudice, or discrimination against Jews. A person having such positions is called an antisemite. Antisemitism is generally considered to be a form of racism. In July 2012, two ladies were attacked in Germany, showered with poisonous gas, and were indicated a “Hitler salute,” evidently as a result of a Star of David jewelry that they wore. In late August 2012, Berlin police examined an assault on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old girl, supposedly by four Arab adolescents, after which the rabbi required treatment for head wounds at a medical clinic. The police grouped the assault as a scorn wrongdoing. Jüdische Allgemeine detailed that the rabbi was wearing a kippah and was drawn closer by one of the adolescents, who inquired as to whether he was Jewish. The teenager at that point assaulted the rabbi while hollering prejudiced remarks, and took steps to slaughter the rabbi’s girl. An Horrific act of anti-Semitism took  place outside the synagogue. Jewish student was attacked outside German synagogue. It was an attempted murder with strong anti-semantic intent. The Chancellor Angela Merkel called this act an “disgrace”. The incident was in Hamburg Synagogue. A 26 year old student was very badly injured while stepping out of the synagogue by a man who repeatedly stuck him over his head with a shovel. The Jewish people that day were celebrating Sukkot, A Jewish festival. Also known as the feast of Tabernacles. The incident took place in the retaliation of an act which happened an year ago in the German city of Halle, were two people were shot dead by the extremist when they were violently entering the synagogue. The suspect, 29 year old was arrested as soon as this happened. The police was already present to protect the synagogue. The suspect was dressed in combat outfit with a hand drawn swastika sign in his pocket. It has been estimated that over 2031 such cases took place last year that is 2019.",

   "text":"WASHINGTON: South Korean battery makers LG Chem and rival SK Innovation have agreed to settle a trade secrets dispute that has threatened a key Georgia plant and the electric vehicle plans of Ford Motor and Volkswagen, three sources briefed on the matter said. The Biden administration through the US Trade Representative's Office (USTR) faced a Sunday (Apr 11) night deadline on whether to take the rare step of reversing a US International Trade Commission decision unless the companies had agreed a deal. An announcement of the battery makers' settlement is expected soon, the sources said. The agreement is a win for President Joe Biden who has made boosting electric vehicles and US battery production a top priority. The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs, and Biden has proposed spending US$174 billion to hike EV sales and expand charging infrastructure. The accord puts an end to a bitter two-year dispute between affiliates of two of South Korea's biggest conglomerates. After losing out to SK in its bid to win Volkswagen orders, LG accused SK of stealing trade secrets by poaching nearly 80 of its employees. The ITC in February sided with LG Chem after the company accused SK of misappropriating trade secrets related to EV battery technology and issued a 10-year-import ban, but it allowed SK to import components for batteries for Ford's EV F-150 program for four years, and Volkswagen's North American EVs for two years. SK vowed to walk away from its US$2.6 billion Georgia battery plant under construction if the ITC decision was not overturned. The ITC also faulted what it called SK's \"egregious misconduct\" and SK's destruction of documents ordered by company executives. Ford, VW, LG and SK declined to comment. Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh wrote in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that if the ITC decision were left in place, it could \"reduce US battery capacity and delay the transition to electric vehicles\". LG first filed a complaint against SK in 2019 and both sides hired numerous lawyers and consultants to make their case to the Biden administration. The administration has been pushing the two companies to try to reach a settlement, as have VW and Ford, the sources said. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai has been personally involved in the settlement discussions and urged both companies to come to a resolution, sources said. USTR declined to comment. SK in March received proposed terms from LG, including financial reparations to address LG's trade secrets misappropriation claims, Reuters reported earlier citing a person familiar with the situation. Georgia is home to two newly-elected Democratic US Senators who are a linchpin of Biden's slim Congressional majority and have both spoken about the importance of ensuring the Georgia plant's future. Both senators repeatedly pressed the companies to reach agreement. Warnock praised the reported deal that will ensure the Georgia plant's survival, saying in a statement on Saturday that it \"will help keep the local economy moving forward\". Last month, Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp urged Biden to intervene, noting SK's plant will employ nearly 2,600 and is the largest foreign investment in the state's history: \"Simply put: the livelihoods of thousands of Georgians are now in your hands.\" LG's battery unit LG Energy Solution is nearing completion of an Ohio cell manufacturing plant with General Motors and is close to announcing plans to build a US$2.3 billion second facility in Tennessee, sources told Reuters. LG has said it can handle the battery needs of automakers if SK abandons its Georgia plant. SK has said LG could not handle the VW and Ford contracts, and that Chinese manufacturers could step in to meet demand. Bloomberg reported the expected deal earlier on Saturday. ",

   "text":"A North Korean statistical survey of the nation has revealed more than 100 deaths and 13,000 “suspected” coronavirus cases in the northeastern province of North Hamgyong, undercutting the government’s claim that the country remains totally “virus-free,” sources in the province told RFA. “According to regional statistics… the number of patients who died due to suspected coronavirus symptoms is more than 100,” a North Hamgyong official told RFA’s Korean Service Wednesday. “In Chongjin alone, where the provincial government agencies are located, about 5,400 people have been diagnosed as suspected coronavirus patients, and more than 10 residents died after showing symptoms,” said the source, who requested anonymity for professional reasons. The source said that authorities and residents refer to all patients with coronavirus symptoms as “suspected coronavirus patients.” Since the start of the pandemic in January 2020, North Korea has taken extensive measures to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, including the complete shutdown of the Sino-Korean border and the suspension of all trade with China, lockdowns of entire counties and cities, and a ban on travel between provinces. Pyongyang declared its “preventative measures” successful in April 2020 as Pak Myong Su, the director of the anti-epidemic department of North Korea’s Central Emergency Anti-Epidemic Headquarters, gave a rare interview with foreign media, where he said that “not a single person was infected” with the virus. Observers immediately doubted the claim, citing North Koreas’ crumbling medical infrastructure, the relative ease by which people could cross the Sino-Korean border, and the willingness of the regime to hide the truth from the international community. Additionally, RFA reported in April 2020 that the government warned the public through health lectures that COVID-19 had at that time been spreading in three specific areas of the country, including North Hamgyong. The survey conducted by the Ministry of Health earlier this month, which compiled data of “suspected coronavirus patients” and those who died from “related symptoms,” revealed some 13,000 cases in North Hamgyong, the most in the entire country. According to the survey’s results, reported to the ruling Korean Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, most of the suspected cases were in the cities, including the provincial capital Chongjin, North Korea’s third largest city and home to more than 600,000 people. The North Hamgyong official said that hospitals \"diagnose acute pneumonia for those who die after showing coronavirus symptoms. Everyone, including the family members of the deceased, thinks that they simply died from acute pneumonia.\" “The authorities say there are no confirmed cases, but they are restricting the movement of the residents much more strongly than before. This is causing the people to experience great difficulties in making a living, but they are warned of severe punishment if they violate movement restrictions while showing suspected coronavirus symptoms,” the source said. Another source, an official of the city of Rason, bordering Russia in the province’s northeast, told RFA Wednesday that the city had more than 6,000 confirmed cases. “There are dozens of people who have died from illness after showing coronavirus symptoms, but hospitals and public health centers only emphasize hand washing, masks, and disinfection with salt water. They don’t offer any special treatment or quarantine measures,” said the second source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. “In accordance with the orders of the Central Committee, the quarantine authorities, along with the administrative and judicial authorities, are fiercely cracking down on local gatherings and family events,” said the second source. The second source said authorities were using meetings of the local neighborhood watch units to tell the people to limit their movement as much as possible. “Authorities are asking people who show suspected coronavirus symptoms to report to quarantine stations or hospitals without delay, but the residents are hiding their symptoms because they are forced to stay in shabby medical facilities as soon as they come in.” The World Health Organization (WHO) did not respond to RFA inquiries regarding the nationwide statistical survey as of Thursday. In its March 19 report, the WHO reported zero confirmed COVID-19 cases through March 11.",

   "text":"Mumbai-based ET Now Anchor Varun Hiremath has been accused of raping a 22-year-old Pune-based woman in New Delhi.  In yet another major development in the rape case against ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath, the victim has written to Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Police Commissioner alleging failure by the police to arrest him.  The letter written by the victim and addressed to Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava and Home Minister Amit Shah also questioned why the prosecution had failed to demand his presence at the time of filing an anticipatory bail application by the accused.  “This shocking degree of insensitivity towards my case is deeply distressing, and also makes me understand the true reason as to why so many rape victims in our country choose to suffer in silence, rather than to seek justice against their perpetrators,” said the victim in her letter, a copy of which is accessed by India Legal. The letter comes two days after the Delhi High Court granted interim protection from arrest to ET Now anchor Varun Hiremath in a case registered against him under charges of rape. A single-judge bench of Justice Mukta Gupta on April 9 granted the relief, however, she clarified that the same would only be provided if Hiremath joins the investigation. Mumbai-based ET Now Anchor Varun Hiremath has been accused of raping a 22-year-old Pune-based woman in New Delhi. The journalist was anticipating arrest in connection with the FIR lodged by the woman in Chanakyapuri Police station under sec. 376 (punishment for rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), and 509 (insulting modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint, the woman had alleged that she was raped by Hiremath in ITC Maurya Hotel in Chanakyapuri. However, Hiremath denied the allegation as false and frivolous as the FIR was registered after a delay of 3 days i.e on 23rd February 2021. Thereafter, Hiremath moved the Bombay High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail which was rejected last month. While rejecting the plea, Justice P.D. Naik observed that the applicant is charged under Section 376 of IPC, hence, the court is not inclined to grant such relief in this case. However, the applicant may approach the appropriate court, the Judge had said. Later, a Delhi court had also refused the anticipatory bail application of Hiremath, while observing that if the woman states in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent. The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Khanagwal.  \n \n \n   \n \n",

   "article_summary":"International law does not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres in EEZ without the consent of the concerned state, says Delhi",
   "text":"The US Navy carried out a “freedom of navigation” operation in India’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near Lakshadweep Islands earlier this week, without New Delhi’s prior consent, to challenge what the US said were India’s “excessive” maritime claims, a official US statement said. The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer   on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said.   The US Navy said it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state.   The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.”   The MEA added: “The   was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile, the US Seventh Fleet said: “  (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”   It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.  ",

   "text":" Jacinda Ardern’s landslide election win gives her a mandate for the transformational change she has been promising New Zealand for three years, but the COVID-19 pandemic may limit what she can actually do.FILE PHOTO: New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern participates in a televised debate with National leader Judith Collins at TVNZ in Auckland, New Zealand, September 22, 2020. The prime minister’s signature achievement in all but eliminating the new coronavirus from the Pacific island nation through strict lockdowns propelled her to victory on Saturday. But this approach may also hinder the recovery New Zealanders are hoping for and the progressive policies Ardern champions. The general election was “tectonic,” and with this mandate, Ardern “needs to deliver”, said Richard Shaw, professor of politics at Massey University. Up early on Sunday, hours after delivering the biggest win in half a century for her centre-left Labour Party, Ardern was dealing with the pandemic again as a new infection sprang up, ending a two-week coronavirus-free run. New Zealand had been free of community cases for more than 100 days until new infections emerged in Auckland in August. The new case is unlikely to spread further, health officials said, but it highlighted the risk the nation of 5 million faces as it pours its efforts into keeping the raging pandemic off its shores. Ardern has assigned NZ$62 billion ($41 billion) to COVID-19 recovery this year, most of it on wage subsidies to avoid massive job losses. She deployed business loans and rent freezes, and eased some tax requirements. But with no plans for major tax reform and revenue shrinking from tourism and immigration, two of New Zealand’s top money generators, there are questions over how the government can achieve its social and economic goals. “There is not a huge pot of money available outside of the COVID response,” said Brad Olsen, senior economist at Wellington-based economic consultancy firm Infometrics. “So you do wonder what issues have to take priority and how they can achieve transformational change while also ramping up the COVID-19 response,” he said. With net core crown debt forecast at NZ$201 billion ($133 billion), or 55% of gross domestic product by 2024 – up from less than 20% before the pandemic – Ardern’s borrowing options are shrinking. New Zealand governments of all stripes have traditionally sought to keep debt below 20% of GDP. Ardern, 40, trailing in opinion polls as late as February, saw Labour’s support shoot up as New Zealanders rallied behind her “go hard, go early” approach to COVID-19. But her lockdowns crippled the tourism-centred economy and hobbled her efforts to tackle child poverty, homelessness, inequality and climate change. Unemployment is expected to double to about 8% in the next two years. Voters do not want the government to cut spending, Olsen said. Ardern wants to build affordable housing, raise minimum wages and spur thousands of jobs in environment-friendly projects. On issues like child poverty and homelessness, where New Zealand is one of the worst performers among developed nations, Ardern has launched schemes like free school lunches and support for buying first homes. She argued it was impossible to meet these targets in her first three-year term, asking voters for a full mandate to bring meaningful change. “After this result we have the mandate to accelerate our response and our recovery, and tomorrow we start,” she promised voters on Saturday night. Ardern’s critics have questioned her ability to tackle the economic crisis. “I feel very concerned for my country,” opposition National Party leader Judith Collins said on Sunday, vowing to keep pressing Ardern on economic issues. Collins had argued the centre-right National was better placed to take New Zealand through this financial crisis. Ardern’s biggest success has been to draw New Zealanders closer with her brand of compassionate leadership at a time of deep uncertainty, in contrast to political leaders around the world who were seen polarising and dividing. She struck a similar tone with supporters after the vote, saying that in an increasingly polarised world, New Zealand was showing it was united. “Elections aren’t always great at bringing people together, but they also don’t need to tear one another apart,” she said.

   "text":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on monday said necessary changes are being made in every sector to ensure growth and to make this decade India’s. “In the last 6-7 months you might have seen the speed and the ambit of reforms are increasing. Whether it is agriculture, space, defense, aviation, or labor. In every sector necessary changes are being made for growth,” Modi said. Addressing the centenary convocation of the University of Mysore through video conferencing, he said it is being done for the sake of crores of youth in this country and to make this decade India’s. “This decade can be India’s only when we make our foundations strong. This decade has brought the immense opportunity for the youth,” he added. Modi greeted the people of the state on the occasion of “Nada Habba” (state festival) Dasara. Expressing sympathy towards those affected by floods in several parts of the state, the Prime Minister said the central and the Karnataka governments together were doing every bit to provide relief to all those affected. Speaking on the National Education Policy, he said, skilling, reskilling, and upskilling were the need of the day and the policy focuses on it. He also said that efforts were being made at all levels to make India a global hub for higher education and our youth competitive. Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala and Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan were present on the occasion. (Source: PTI)",

   "text":"SINGAPORE: Singaporean businesses, like other enterprises in Myanmar, have been trying to navigate the turbulent waves created by the military coup on Feb 1. Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.",

   "text":"A North Korean trade representative in China tasked with bringing in a million U.S. dollars a year for the Pyongyang regime took his life when the coronavirus made raising the funds impossible, fellow traders in China told RFA. The trader, stationed in the Chinese city of Dandong on the border with North Korea’s Sinuiju, was in charge of selling rare-earth elements mined in North Korea, for use in Chinese manufacturing. At the beginning of the pandemic in Jan. 2020, Pyongyang and Beijing shut down their 880-mile border and suspended all trade and traffic, leaving the man with no way to deliver the ore to China. Sources told RFA the trader was still on the hook for the $1 million even though he now had no way to make the money. “In February, a North Korean trade worker took his life in Dandong. The coronavirus made it so there was no hope of resuming North Korea-China trade. He had no way to meet the foreign currency goals he had been assigned,” a Chinese citizen of Korean descent told RFA’s Korean Service March 27. “He was a skilled businessman who earned a lot of foreign currency by smuggling ore concentrates into China… with an annual assignment of $1 million,” the source said. Ore concentrate from North Korea cannot be legally exported due to international sanctions aimed at depriving Pyongyang of cash and resources that could be funneled into its nuclear and missile programs. “He opened offices in Dandong and Dalian, selling molybdenum and cerium concentrates. He was a member of the Chilsung trading company, which is under Office 39, and he earned more through smuggling than official trade,” said the source. Formally the Central Committee Bureau 39 of the Workers' Party of Korea, the organization charged with procuring funds for Kim Jong Un was set up in the late 1970s under the rule of regime founder Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un’s grandfather. The office has foreign currency-earning agents in many countries, and they are expected to earn money regardless of the economic circumstances. RFA reports from the past year documented how trade officials in charge of North Korean laborers in China were begging to find work for them after opportunities dried up due to the pandemic. The pressure to meet the earnings goal is so high for trade workers sent abroad, and the ore trader had been a valued asset to the regime. “We know that this trade worker was seen as a very loyal trade worker by the authorities. He regularly met his assigned earning goals by smuggling the rare metals, and he also sent a large amount to Pyongyang in loyalty funds each time,” the source said, referring to cash payments demanded by the regime. “But we found out that after coronavirus hit trade, he had been covering the funding assignment by taking out loans from his Chinese counterparts because smuggling ore concentrate was impossible,” said the source. Another source, a Chinese citizen of Korean descent from Dalian, about 171 miles west of Dandong, confirmed the death to RFA. “The other North Korean trade officials are greatly discouraged by his suicide because he had once been a very successful trader,” the second source said. “He was a man in his 50s who specialized in smuggling ore concentrates,” the second source said, confirming that he regularly met his state-assigned foreign currency targets in excess of $1 million each year. “Because such a competent trade worker took his own life due to all the pressure, the North Korean authorities exempted trade workers in China from paying their assignments until the coronavirus situation subsides,” said the second source. RFA reported earlier this month that trade workers in China were temporarily exempt from their currency earning obligations, but at that time it was not known that the ore concentrate smuggler’s death may have been the catalyst. “For nearly a month after the suicide, the authorities in Pyongyang refused to receive the body, saying it was due to the coronavirus. The body could not be buried in the mountains in North Korea, so they cremated it without any documents,” the second source said. “Because the trade worker is a citizen of North Korea, they cannot put his remains in a Chinese columbarium, so they just keep it in a storage room. During his lifetime, he was busy earning foreign currency and gave a lot in loyalty funds, but now they won’t even take his remains and he’s stuck in a storage room in China.” According to another RFA report, North Korean state companies this month began hoarding molybdenum ore. Sources said the hoarding caused a spike in molybdenum prices inside North Korea, and that it could be seen as an indication that trade with China could resume soon. North Korean trade workers dispatched abroad often run afoul of international law when trying to meet their foreign currency targets. Earlier this month, Mun Chol Myong, a trader assigned to earn foreign currency in Malaysia, became the first North Korean national to be extradited to the U.S. He is accused of laundering money through the U.S. financial system as a means to evade sanctions and provide luxury items to North Korean elites. The extradition caused Pyongyang to break off relations with Malaysia, and RFA reported that trade officials in China feared that the diplomats in the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur could face punishment upon their return to North Korea.",

   "text":"The United States government could impose visa sanctions on countries that do not accept people returning from the US, President Donald Trump asserted on Friday. Trump wants to ensure “the repatriation of foreign nationals who violate the laws of the United States”. This comes in the backdrop the pandemic which has now eclipsed United States and hit it harder than European countries. The revelation came to light in a memorandum addressed to the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It further states that Pompeo is expected to \"initiate a plan to impose the visa sanctions\" if the Homeland Security Department determines a country not accepting returnees is delaying or impeding operations \"necessary to respond to the ongoing pandemic\" in the next seven days. However, no countries were named in particular. On March 21, new border rules were implemented by the Trump administration in purview of the coronavirus pandemic. As part of these new rules, US officials have the power to remove people by circumventing the usual immigration proceedings. Over 7,000 migrants have been deported to Mexico since the new rules came into effect, Reuters reported. The coronavirus pandemic has now killed over 100,000 around the world, AFP reported. This coincided with the festival of Easter whereby churches remained empty across the world as people were advised to stay at home to practice social distancing. A few days ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) had claimed how lifting lockdowns too early could lead to a second wave and would be a catastrophe. More than half of the world population is currently self-isolating. As of now, the number of infections stand at roughly 1.6 million. The pandemic has taken the lives of over 100,859 people. Europe remains the hardest hit with 70 per cent deaths recorded there. The epicentre of the pandemic has shifted twice, first from China to Europe, and then from Europe to North America.",

   "text":"Coronavirus has now reached uncharted territories: indigenous tribes in the Amazon basin are now threatened by the killer pandemic as the first death among tribes was reported yesterday. A 15-year-boy from an isolated tribe called “Yanomami” passed away recently, as per Brazil’s Ministry of Health. The boy was put in the intensive care unit of Roraima General Hospital in Boa Vista on April 3 after he was tested positive. Even then, the hospital has not released the exact cause of his death yet. His test status was revealed on Wednesday during a press conference. \"Today we had a confirmed case in the Yanomami, which concerns us a lot. This is a government concern for indigenous health”, the ministry spokesperson said. The Amazon basin has numerous rainforests and is filled with mountains stretching from northern Brazil to souther Venezuela. One of the most isolated tribes in South America, the Yanomami have 38,000 members. According to the Socio-Environmental Institute, the virus was transmitted to the tribe from miners who had visited indigenous territory illegally, CNN reported. \"Today, without a doubt, the main vector for the spread of COVID-19 inside the Yanomami Indigenous Territory is the more than 20,000 illegal miners that go in and out of the territory without any control,\" ISA’s statement redad.   \"The Yanomami, as many other indigenous people, are among the groups most vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19 and should be urgently protected, under the risk of genocide with the complicity of the Brazilian State”, it added. This is the third indigenous death related to COVID-19.",

   "text":"Authorities in North Korea have purged a local government official for allowing a coronavirus quarantine center to operate at reduced capacity at a time when Pyongyang is trying to maximize defenses against the deadly virus, sources in the country told RFA. North Korea publicly claims it is virus free, but it has employed strict measures to prevent the spread of the virus through the country, including locking down cities and counties, cancelling major cultural events, and forbidding travel between provinces. In November 2020, the government upgraded the country’s “emergency quarantine posture,” in place since the beginning of the pandemic, to a policy of “ultra-high-level emergency quarantine measures,” all while telling the international community that it had not confirmed a single case. The purged official was the head of a county-level office of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party in North Pyongan province, in the country’s northwest. Unconfirmed reports of his execution are now making other local officials nervous. “In February, the head of the party organization in Uiju county was purged for the ‘crime’ of having disobeyed the Highest Dignity’s order to maximize the coronavirus emergency quarantine,” a North Pyongan official told RFA’s Korean Service Monday, using an honorific term to refer to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They say he was quietly executed under the direction of the Central Party, but this is not confirmed,” said the source, who requested anonymity for professional reasons. According to the source, the purge came after the Central Committee received an anonymous complaint from another Uiju county official. “The complaint said that the head of the party organization gave orders to reduce the capacity of Uiju’s quarantine facilities for suspected coronavirus patients,” said the source. “The Central Party then dispatched a team to investigate the case, and they found that Uiju’s quarantine facility was not operating properly,” the source said. Uiju county had been under financial stress at the time, and had to make some cutbacks, the source explained. “They had insufficient operating funds. The county’s quarantine authorities proposed to the county party that they would tell patients with mild symptoms to self-isolate in their homes, with the high-fever patients using the quarantine center,” said the source. “They reduced the capacity of the quarantine facility with approval. The official who approved the plan was the head of the county’s party organization,” the source said. Operating the center at reduced capacity went against directives not to be lax with quarantine rules. “They made an example out of him for neglecting the Highest Dignity’s order to maximize public quarantine projects during the prolonged national emergency. It rang an alarm for the officials who are themselves becoming less thorough in implementing the quarantine,” said the source. Another source, also from North Pyongan, confirmed the purge to RFA Tuesday, saying that Uiju’s administrative organizations are in chaos due to anxiety on the part of officials. “After the head of the county party organization was purged, the chairman of the People’s Committee was also dismissed for failing to properly manage the quarantine facility,” said the second source, who requested anonymity for security reasons.   “Officials… believe the purge is the result of a power struggle between party leaders. They wonder why the chief secretary of the Uiju county party, who is in charge of the case, was not punished,” the second source said. Authorities held a lecture session for the officials last week, saying that the party leader’s negligence of the emergency situation was a threat to the nation’s existence, according to the second source. “They again delivered the Highest Dignity’s message that mistakes in economic projects can be corrected, but mistakes in implementing the quarantine should not be tolerated,” the second source said, adding that the increased scrutiny was causing officials to feel more anxious. The second source also said that 10 North Pyongan officials, including military personnel, had been purged between March and May 2020 for violating quarantine guidelines, while in December nine officials and others involved with smuggling at the Chinese border in the country’s northern Ryanggang province were purged for the same reason. RFA reported in December that a smuggler was publicly executed the previous month in the northwestern province of North Pyongan for violating emergency quarantine measures by trying to conduct business with his Chinese partners. Sources in that report said ordinary residents in North Korea’s border region felt that the execution was meant to scare them into not complaining that the emergency quarantine measures affect their livelihood.",

   "article_summary":"A growing number of world leaders advocate making ecocide a crime before the International Criminal Court, to serve as a “moral line” for the planet.",
   "text":"In 1948, after Nazi Germany exterminated millions of Jews and other minorities during World War II, the United Nations adopted a convention establishing a new crime so heinous it demanded collective action. Genocide, the nations declared, was “condemned by the civilized world” and justified intervention in the affairs of sovereign states. Now, a small but growing number of world leaders including Pope Francis and French President Emmanuel Macron have begun citing an offense they say poses a similar threat to humanity and remains beyond the reach of international criminal law: ecocide, or widespread destruction of the environment. The pope describes ecocide as “the massive contamination of air, land and water,” or “any action capable of producing an ecological disaster,” and   it a sin for Roman Catholics. The Pontiff has also endorsed a campaign by environmental activists and legal scholars to make ecocide the fifth crime before the International Criminal Court in The Hague as a legal deterrent to the kinds of far-reaching environmental damage that are driving mass extinction, ecological collapse and climate change. The monumental step, which faces a long road of global debate, would mean political leaders and corporate executives could face charges and imprisonment for \"ecocidal\" acts. To make their case, advocates point to the Amazon, where fires raged out of control in 2019, and where the rainforest may now be so degraded   than it draws in. At the poles, human activity is thawing a frozen Arctic and destabilizing the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Across the globe, climate change is disrupting the reliable seasonal rhythms that have sustained human life for millennia, while hurricanes, floods and other climate-driven disasters have   in the last six months. Fossil fuel pollution has   annually in recent years, according to a study in Environmental Research, more than tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS combined. One in 4 mammals  . For amphibians, it’s 4 in 10. Damage to nature has become so extensive and widespread around the world that many environmentalists speak of ecocide to describe numerous environmentally devastated hot spots: The campaign to criminalize ecocide is now moving from the fringe of advocacy into global diplomacy, pushed by a growing recognition among advocates and many political leaders that climate change and environmental causes are tied inherently to human rights and social justice. The effort remains a long shot and is at least years from fruition, international and environmental law experts say. Advocates will have to navigate political tensions over whether national governments or the international community have ultimate control over natural resources. And they’ll likely face opposition from countries with high carbon emissions and deep ties to industrial development. The environmentalists must also figure out how criminal law would address climate change, which has been driven by practices like burning coal and gasoline that are not only legal, but central to the global economy. The campaign to make ecocide a crime, however, is about more than law. Jojo Mehta, who launched the Stop Ecocide campaign in 2017 with Polly Higgins, a Scottish lawyer who died in 2019, describes it as a moral and practical issue as well. “We use criminal law to draw moral lines,” Mehta said. “We say something’s not accepted, your murder is not acceptable. And so, simply putting mass damage and destruction of nature below that red line actually makes a huge difference, and it will make a difference to the people that are financing what is going on.” Scott W. Badenoch Jr., an American environmental lawyer who favors the criminalization of ecocide, used the term to describe the state, and fate, of the Earth. “Ecocide is now endemic all over the planet,” he said. “The structures of ecology that have held up living organisms on Earth, since time immemorial, are collapsing everywhere.” He added, “Ecocide is now, frankly, the process that we are living in on Earth.” The concept of ecocide was born of tragedy. Over a period of 10 years, the United States government sprayed   of powerful herbicides, including Agent Orange, across the countryside in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos to expose enemy sanctuaries during the Vietnam War. The dioxin-laced chemicals defoliated verdant jungle and caused cancers, neurological disease and birth defects in people living nearby. While the number of victims is disputed,   there are more than 3 million. In 1970, Yale biologist Arthur Galston invoked the destruction to call on the world to outlaw what he called “ecocide.” More than 20 years later, the global community came together to form the International Criminal Court, which was formally established in 2002 under a treaty called the Rome Statute to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity, crimes of aggression and war crimes when its member countries, which currently  , fail to do so themselves. Early drafts of the Rome Statute included the crime of environmental destruction,   after opposition from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, based on various concerns, including that it wasn’t precisely defined. Instead, it was relegated to a wartime offense that has never been enforced. As a result, international criminal law includes few guardrails to prevent peacetime environmental destruction. “There's a big gap and something needs to fill it,” said Badenoch, a visiting attorney at the Environmental Law Institute. “We currently cannot hold big corporations or big governments accountable for ecocide,” Badenoch added. “So, what do you do? We name and shame — that's all we've got.” Decades of oil extraction in Nigeria by subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell, for example, have   in parts of the country with benzene and other toxic pollutants, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Civil lawsuits have taken years to wind through European courts, and no laws were strong enough to prevent the damage from happening, though Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary was recently  . Curtis Smith, a Shell spokesman,   that says many of the spills have come as a result of sabotage and theft, and that the company has been working with stakeholders to clean up the pollution identified by the U.N. Environment Program. The International Criminal Court's supranational authority would make an ecocide crime particularly powerful, said Kate Mackintosh, executive director of the Promise Institute for Human Rights at the University of California Los Angeles. An ecocide crime would require International Criminal Court members to enact their own national ecocide laws, and failure to enforce those laws would enable the international court to step in. While political leaders and warlords have been the usual targets of the court, an ecocide crime could place business executives on notice, too. “That could make a difference in corporate boardroom conversations,” Mackintosh said. Even the threat of being labeled an international criminal, she said, might deter destructive corporate behavior. “I mean, for PR, it doesn’t look good, does it?” Mackintosh said making ecocide a crime could help in weak states, where corporate polluters are sometimes more powerful than national governments. “The likelihood of any criminal prosecution taking place in that state is pretty low,” she said. “But with an international crime, that’s actually not a bar.” China, the United States, India and Russia — four of the world’s top polluters — are not members of the International Criminal Court, but if a corporation based in one of those countries were to operate within a member state, as many of them do, their executives could fall under the court’s jurisdiction. The push to criminalize ecocide remained on the periphery until December 2019, when Vanuatu and the Maldives, two island nations threatened by rising seas and climate change-driven extreme weather, recommended that the court consider amending its statute to “criminalize acts that amount to ecocide.” “Our legacy and our future are at stake,” Vanuatu’s ambassador to the European Union, John Licht,  , stressing a “common bond” that united all the world’s people. “Our lives are intertwined by the environment we live in.” Willy Missack, who has served as part of Vanuatu’s delegation to the United Nations climate negotiations, said diplomats from other countries expressed shock when “little tiny Vanuatu” — a remote archipelago of more than 80 islands in the South Pacific — said it wanted to take on global powers and the fossil fuel industry through the courts. But the fact that corporations can continue to profit from carbon emissions that are threatening his country’s future, Missack said, makes the legal case clear. “It is not right,” he said, “and this is where justice comes in.” After Vanuatu asked the International Criminal Court to consider criminalizing ecocide, Mehta’s Stop Ecocide Foundation independently convened a panel of international legal experts, including Mackintosh of UCLA, to draft a clear definition of ecocide. They plan to publish their definition in June, at which point they hope at least one of the court’s member nations will formally propose that the court adopt ecocide as the fifth international crime against peace. Mehta has said the definition would likely require   of environmental destruction related to practices like widespread logging, drilling, mining and deep-sea trawling. Richard J. Rogers, a British expert in international criminal law who is a partner at Global Diligence and a member of the drafting panel, said it may be relatively straightforward to criminalize certain acts, like destruction of a forest or waterway. But climate change poses a greater challenge: Not only is it difficult to connect polluters to specific harms, he said, but there’s also nothing illegal about extracting or burning fossil fuels. “The situation we're dealing with is that the carbon system, which has fueled our economies since the Industrial Revolution, has not only been lawful, but it's been encouraged,” Rogers said. Another point that the drafters will have to grapple with is whether the crime of ecocide should require prosecutors to prove that humans have been harmed. Mackintosh said that while this “human harm” threshold could prove appealing politically — the court's existing crimes all largely involve harm to humans — focusing ecocide only on the environment could make it easier for prosecutors to prove, especially when it comes to harms related to climate change, which are often incremental and indirect. If a nation agrees to introduce the ecocide proposal to the International Criminal Court for consideration, that is when even harder work will begin. Ratification is a multistep process that would require support from either two-thirds or seven-eighths of the court’s members, depending on the type of amendment introduced. (Vanuatu still supports the campaign, but Covid-19 and the country’s “limited resources for international diplomacy” have put its ecocide advocacy on hold, said Dreli Solomon, a spokesman for Vanuatu’s embassy in Brussels.) While no country has committed to formally proposing that the court adopt ecocide, the campaign is gaining traction, fueled by the youth-led climate movement and radical new groups like Extinction Rebellion. In December, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmès asked International Criminal Court member states to   of adopting ecocide as a crime. A member of Belgium’s Parliament has also proposed a bill to criminalize ecocide. And French lawmakers are working on legislation to make ecocide an   punishable by fines and prison, though Stop Ecocide   as “weak.” At least 10 countries have national ecocide laws already, including Vietnam, which enacted the law in 1990. Separately, French lawyers in January filed a request on behalf of Amazonian indigenous groups asking the International Criminal Court to investigate Bolsonaro of Brazil for crimes against humanity. The appeal alleges that deforestation encouraged by Bolsonaro’s government and other policies have forced indigenous people from their homes and even led to murders in the region. While the request relies on citations of crimes the court already addresses, the lawyers who submitted it     the case is also an example of ecocide. The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said in a statement that \"the Bolsonaro administration is taking concrete action to improve the lives of Indigenous peoples and ensure the future of the Amazon.\" The embassy said that over 70 percent of the eligible Indigenous population has received initial Covid-19 vaccinations and that deforestation rates in the Amazon were 21 percent lower from August to January , compared to the same period a year earlier. Badenoch said that while the hurdles to adopting a new international crime are high, they are not insurmountable. “These things take a long time and they are complex,” he said. “But they can be done.” While the campaign for an ecocide law could take years — if it is successful at all — advocates say the effort could bear fruit much sooner: The ecocide campaign has thrust the concept into public discussion. Mehta doesn’t expect the campaign to catch fire in the United States, but after four years of President Donald Trump, she’s heartened by the arrival of John Kerry, Biden’s special climate envoy. “We don’t expect the U.S. to join the ICC any time soon, but that said, the conversation around ecocide itself, we don’t see any reason why it can’t start happening in the U.S.,” she said. The State Department released a statement saying that the U.S. “regularly engages with other countries” on “the importance of preventing environmental destruction during armed conflict,” but added, “We do not comment on the details of our communications with foreign governments.” Mehta’s campaign is also part of a wider effort by activists who have been looking to the courts to force more aggressive action on climate change. As of July 1, 2020, at least 1,550 climate change cases have been filed in 38 countries,  . In 2015, a Dutch court ruled in the Urgenda Climate Case that the government had acted negligently by failing to take aggressive enough action to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the ruling in   in 2019 and ordered the government to hit specific emissions reductions targets, sparking a series of similar lawsuits in other countries. In one of those lawsuits, a Paris administrative court  for failing to meet its goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ruling relied, in part, on France’s nonbinding commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, taking what had been the soft pledge of politics and turning it into a legally binding commitment. Mehta has framed an ecocide law as a counterweight to the failings of the Paris Agreement, saying in   that it offers “a way to correct the shortcomings” of the global climate pact. “Whereas Paris lacks sufficient ambition, transparency and accountability, the criminalization of ecocide would be an enforceable deterrent.” Alex Whiting, a professor at Harvard Law School and former coordinator of prosecutions at the International Criminal Court, said that making ecocide a crime before the court would have tremendous impact, even if only a few cases were actually prosecuted. “When a crime becomes an international crime, it has a ripple effect,” he said. “The environment is the issue of our time. Being able to do something about that seems important.” In Vanuatu, though, there is a sense that the pace of climate change is beginning to outrun the country’s ability to adapt. Cyclones that have devastated the islands are expected to intensify as the globe continues to warm. Missack, the Vanuatu diplomat, said the effects of climate change run much deeper than damage from storms. Most of the country’s residents depend on the crops they grow and the fish they catch, so their lives are intertwined with the environment around them. Recently, the harvest of yam, a key crop that is  , was disrupted, throwing it out of alignment with the seasonal and celestial markers and accompanying rituals that normally tell farmers when to reap. “One day we will talk about the stars, and this is how the ritual goes. But it will never be the same spirit, the same soul of the ritual,” Missack said. “And that loss, none of the money in this world can pay for it.”",

   "article_summary":"Seeing herself losing the chair, Didi has stooped to such a low level, says Modi",
   "text":" Enraged by the killing of four Trinamul Congress workers by Central paramilitary forces in Coochbehar during the fourth phase of Assembly election in West Bengal on Saturday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused Union home minister Amit Shah of being a \"conspirator\" of the shooting and demanded his resignation.  Erupting in fury, Ms Banerjee told a TMC rally in North 24 Parganas, \"A dangerous incident has left me in pain. The Central forces gunned down four persons at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar. Another death also happened in the morning. From the very first day I have been vocal. Central forces are not my enemy. But the way it killed four voters standing in the queue only proved the Union home minister's conspiracy that has been on. Mr Shah, you must resign as you are the conspirator.\"   She alleged, \"After killing so many people, the BJP now claims the firing was in self-defence. They must hang themselves in shame! Where did they get so much audacity from? Where do so many atrocities originate from? BJP knows it has lost in the polls. That is why they are killing the voters and workers. What fault did they commit?\" Puncturing the Trinamul Congress supremo's claim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was also in the state for poll campaign in two districts, referred to Ms Banerjee's alleged provocation to attack the Central forces and warned her and her party workers against hooliganism.   He mourned the loss of lives and urged the Election Commission for strong punishment for the accused of the killings. Addressing a BJP rally in Siliguri of North Bengal, Mr Modi said, \"What happened in Coochbehar is very sad. I mourn the loss of lives in the killings. My condolences with their families. Didi and her goons have been panicked to see the support of the people for the BJP. Seeing herself losing the chair, Didi has stooped to such a low level! But I want to make it clear to the TMC, Didi and her goons that their muscle-flexing will not be allowed in Bengal. I request the Election Commission to take stringent action on the accused of the incident.\"   He however told Ms Banerjee, \"But your tricks to provoke the people in attacking the Central forces on poll-duty and obstruct the polling process will not be able to save you. Your violence after a decade-long misdeed cannot save you. People are casting their votes in large numbers for BJP. North Bengal has shown it.\"  Standing by the Central forces for their role in the poll duty, Mr Modi observed that the TMC chief, not the forces, has become the biggest trouble in the polls.  ",

   "text":"WASHINGTON: South Korean battery makers LG Chem and rival SK Innovation have agreed to settle a trade secrets dispute that has threatened a key Georgia plant and the electric vehicle plans of Ford Motor and Volkswagen, three sources briefed on the matter said. The Biden administration through the US Trade Representative's Office (USTR) faced a Sunday (Apr 11) night deadline on whether to take the rare step of reversing a US International Trade Commission decision unless the companies had agreed a deal. An announcement of the battery makers' settlement is expected soon, the sources said. The agreement is a win for President Joe Biden who has made boosting electric vehicles and US battery production a top priority. The global auto industry is racing to develop EVs, and Biden has proposed spending US$174 billion to hike EV sales and expand charging infrastructure. The accord puts an end to a bitter two-year dispute between affiliates of two of South Korea's biggest conglomerates. After losing out to SK in its bid to win Volkswagen orders, LG accused SK of stealing trade secrets by poaching nearly 80 of its employees. The ITC in February sided with LG Chem after the company accused SK of misappropriating trade secrets related to EV battery technology and issued a 10-year-import ban, but it allowed SK to import components for batteries for Ford's EV F-150 program for four years, and Volkswagen's North American EVs for two years. SK vowed to walk away from its US$2.6 billion Georgia battery plant under construction if the ITC decision was not overturned. The ITC also faulted what it called SK's \"egregious misconduct\" and SK's destruction of documents ordered by company executives. Ford, VW, LG and SK declined to comment. Volkswagen of America CEO Scott Keogh wrote in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that if the ITC decision were left in place, it could \"reduce US battery capacity and delay the transition to electric vehicles\". LG first filed a complaint against SK in 2019 and both sides hired numerous lawyers and consultants to make their case to the Biden administration. The administration has been pushing the two companies to try to reach a settlement, as have VW and Ford, the sources said. US Trade Representative Katherine Tai has been personally involved in the settlement discussions and urged both companies to come to a resolution, sources said. USTR declined to comment. SK in March received proposed terms from LG, including financial reparations to address LG's trade secrets misappropriation claims, Reuters reported earlier citing a person familiar with the situation. Georgia is home to two newly-elected Democratic US Senators who are a linchpin of Biden's slim Congressional majority and have both spoken about the importance of ensuring the Georgia plant's future. Both senators repeatedly pressed the companies to reach agreement. Warnock praised the reported deal that will ensure the Georgia plant's survival, saying in a statement on Saturday that it \"will help keep the local economy moving forward\". Last month, Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp urged Biden to intervene, noting SK's plant will employ nearly 2,600 and is the largest foreign investment in the state's history: \"Simply put: the livelihoods of thousands of Georgians are now in your hands.\" LG's battery unit LG Energy Solution is nearing completion of an Ohio cell manufacturing plant with General Motors and is close to announcing plans to build a US$2.3 billion second facility in Tennessee, sources told Reuters. LG has said it can handle the battery needs of automakers if SK abandons its Georgia plant. SK has said LG could not handle the VW and Ford contracts, and that Chinese manufacturers could step in to meet demand. Bloomberg reported the expected deal earlier on Saturday. ",

Sonego, the third seed, won 2-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 in just over three hours to become the first Italian to lift a trophy at home since Filippo Volandri in Palermo in October 2006. The 25-year-old, who reached the fourth round in Roland Garros last year, added to his title in Antalya, Turkey in 2019, having lost his previous final appearance in Vienna last October. Sonego completed a double on the Mediterranean island having partnered Andrea Vavassori to doubles victory on Saturday.

   "text":"Jama'atul Mujahideen India, the Indian wing of mainstream JMB, was divided into three factions due to differences of opinion between leaders. One faction is led by Salahuddin Ahmed alias Salehin, also the present ameer of the JMB. This group has a network in different states of India and its strongholds are in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The second faction is led by Jahidul Islam Mizan alias Boma Mizan, a top bomb expert of the outfit, and its stronghold is in Bardhaman. And the third one is led by Ezaj Sheikh, an Indian, which mainly has strongholds in different districts of West Bengal.  Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) officials of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit claimed to have gotten the information of JMB's Indian wing from Rezaul Haque alias Reza, 37. Reza, who was the in-charge of JMB in Bangladesh, was arrested by BDU team from the capital's Badda on Saturday. A Dhaka court yesterday placed Reza on a seven-day remand after SM Raisul Islam, an inspector of CTTC unit, produced him before the court with a 10-day remand prayer in a case filed under the anti-terrorism act with Bhatara Police Station in November last year. Rahmatullah Chowdhury, in-charge of BDU, told The Daily Star yesterday, \"We got some important information about the outfit's Indian part's activities and network details from Reza.\" \"We are now analysing the information to know the outfit's activities in India,\" he added. Salehin went into hiding and took shelter in India after he was snatched from a prison van in February 2014, along with Boma Mizan. After the two fled to India, the outfit's activities speeded up in the country and a new chapter -- Jama'atul Mujahideen India (JMI) -- was declared in 2018, say investigators. But conflicts developed between Salehin and Mizan over procedure. Salehin was busy establishing the outfit's network between Bangladesh and India but Mizan wanted immediate actions. For this reason, in 2017, Mizan formed a separate faction with Indian national Ezaj, said a high official of CTTC unit, quoting Reza as saying. \"Mizan and Ezaj, however, formed separate factions after Mizan started suspecting Ezaj to be an Indian intelligence agent,\" said the official, requesting anonymity. On August 6, 2018, India's Intelligence Bureau and elite anti-terror probe body, National Investigation Agency, arrested Mizan from Bengaluru. The CTTC official in Bangladesh said they believed Ezaj was also arrested by Indian law enforcers, but did not get any confirmation. \"We are now trying to find out who is leading the factions of Ezaj and Mizan in their absence,\" the official told this newspaper. Of the three factions, Salehin's group is the strongest in India and it has supporters in most states of the country, the official said, quoting Reza as saying. JMB leaders Soleman, Firoz, Tareq and Jamai were mainly working for Salehin's faction in India and spreading the network, said investigators. However, Soleman and Jamai are believed to be in Indian jails, following their arrest by Indian law enforcers. There has been no trace of Firoz and Tareq for a long time, they said, based on the outfit's international communication details. Reza told investigators that Salehin has been staying in isolation for this reason for a long time and he has no connection with other leaders of the outfit in India now. \"We have learnt that Salehin did not take any financial support from Bangladesh to operate the outfit's activities in India. We are now trying to find out from where and how money is going to JMI,\" said another CTTC official. Rahmatullah, also the additional deputy commissioner of CTTC unit, said they were trying to find out details of JMB's network between Bangladesh and India.  ",

   "text":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will next week inaugurate the annual India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, which gathers energy leaders to further important dialogue on the nation’s new energy future. Modi will deliver the inaugural address at the virtual event, to be held on October 26-28, organiser IHS Markit said in a statement. India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, now in its fourth year, is hosted by IHS Markit, a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions. “The event will convene an international group of speakers and delegates as well as a community of a thousand delegates from India and regional energy companies, energy-related industries, institutions and governments,” it said. The event’s speakers include energy ministers, senior industry executives and leading national and international energy experts. Besides Modi, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, US Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) secretary general Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo and Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud are scheduled to speak at the three-day event. BP group chief executive Bernard Looney, TOTAL SA chairman Patrick Pouyann , Petronas group CEO Tengku Muhammad Taufik, Reliance Industries head Mukesh Ambani, and Tellurian Inc president Meg Gentle are also listed as speakers. “In charting its path to a new energy future, India has captured the world’s attention. This event will expand the important discussion on the opportunities, challenges and strategies in a rapidly-changing energy world and India’s role in it,” said Daniel Yergin, IHS Markit vice chairman. Key topics to be explored will include the impact of the pandemic on India’s future energy demand, securing supplies for India’s economic growth, energy transition and the climate agenda, natural gas in the energy mix, and strategies for refining and petrochemicals. “The energy markets are closely watching the pace and shape of economic recovery in India because developments in India will significantly influence the future of energy markets globally,” said Atul Arya, senior vice president and chief energy strategist, IHS Markit. India, he said, is charting its own path during this period of transition and turbulence in the energy sector. (Source: PTI)",

   "text":"Suspected Islamists free 1,300 prisoners from east Congo jail. Armed men freed more than 1,300 prisoners from a jail in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a coordinated attack on Tuesday, the town’s mayor said, blaming an Islamist militant group operating in the area. Militants stage 1,300-prisoner Congo jailbreak Only 110 of 1,456 inmates, including a number of militia fighters, remained following the simultaneous early morning assaults on the Kangbayi central prison in Beni and the military camp defending it, said Modeste Bakwanamaha. “The attackers, who came in large numbers, managed to break the door with electrical equipment,” Bakwanamaha told Reuters. “We believe it was the ADF who did this.” The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has killed more than 1,000 civilians since the start of 2019, according to U.N. figures, despite repeated military campaigns aimed at destroying it. Islamic State said fighters from its Central African Province franchise carried out the attack, according to its AMAQ news agency. The group has claimed responsibility for several suspected ADF attacks in the past. But U.N. experts have consistently found that claims ADF is linked to international jihadists are overblown or false, said Dan Fahey, a former U.N. investigator. Escapes are common from Congo’s overcrowded and poorly secured prisons. A similar number of inmates escaped when the same jail was attacked in June 2017. “This sounds more like an attack by Mai Mai (local rebels), who did the attack three years ago,” Fahey said. ‘MAY THE STATE HAVE MERCY’ Two inmates were shot dead during Tuesday’s raid, which started at around 4:30 a.m., police said on Twitter. The bolt on the prison’s front door appeared to be cut, as well as the metal grate behind it, Reuters TV footage in the aftermath of the raid showed. “We were sleeping in the morning, but around 4:00 we heard a really loud exchange of fire,” said Lukiya Bafana Ruban, one of the few inmates who decided not to flee. “May the state have mercy on us because we voluntarily stayed here in prison.” Kangbayi prison holds members of local rebel groups as well as ADF fighters. Bakwanamaha said there were rumours ADF fighters in the prison were preparing a break-out in the days preceding the attack. By midday around 20 prisoners had returned to the prison, he added. A year ago the army launched a large-scale counter-insurgency campaign against the ADF. In response, the group abandoned its bases, split into smaller, more mobile groups, and retaliated against civilians.",

   "text":"On the contrary, a little bit innovation from our ends could turn things around. After all, isn't this what the pandemic has taught us? That we can, and must work with whatever options we are given. Yes, we are speaking about an easy alternative, such as the replica-grass laden veranda, or the hand-crafted rug placed over the concrete on the rooftop. We can have our mini picnics right at these spots, at the comfort of our very homes, with our loved ones around. A mini basket full of home-baked goodies, fresh fruits and lots of iced tea would enhance our experience. To this, we can add calm retro music or some soothing jazz tunes, especially to match the mood of the afternoon. Few scrambled ideas for the entire day could be to turn the environment into a mini courtyard fit for the queen and the king. Strings of paper lanterns can be used as decorative elements, a splurge can be made out of cushy pillows, decorative furs and a karaoke microphone for singing out loud our favourite tracks.                             At Star Lifestyle, we never miss out on the fashion and the styling suggestions, which we believe, is one of the most integral part of any get-together. This year, try wearing pure-cotton dresses in check prints or the plain khadi for these 'stay-at-home' picnics. Indigo tie-dyes also look brilliant when aesthetically imprinted over the ivory white dress. Make sure you wear a fashionable hat or a matching scarf to match the sensibility of the occasion. Both kitten heels and flats go wonderfully well with the occasion and the loose — flowy, pure  cottons that we suggest you should be wearing. If an occasional pigeon comes now and then, to enjoy your picnic alongside your immediate family, consider your hard-work a success.   \n",

   "text":"Last year, when the entire world stalled and the lockdowns were phasing in and out within the boundaries of every nation, Durjoy Rahman, the founder of Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation spent a lot more time thinking about the artisans hailing from the rural communities of our country — how they would lead their lives when practically every sort of income mechanism had been disrupted. This is when the art connoisseur decided to collaborate with Kamruzzaman Shadhin, Gidree Bawlee Foundation of Arts, to launch 'Bhumi' (Earth), a project to support creative communities of the Thakurgaon district during the COVID-19 crisis. \"I had to start somewhere, and Thakurgaon seemed to be the right place to begin such a mega-scale project, since there are hundreds of traditional craftsmen out there, especially from indigenous communities such as Santals, Rajbongshi and others who were looking for support,\" Durjoy elaborated. This project catered to around 60 families with more than 250 members. The four–month long project had been developed meticulously to tackle the preliminary stages of the economic downturn faced by the resident communities, an after-effect of the sprawling pandemic. \"We planned on the project to help the community of artisans 'up-north' and make their craftsmanship identified and celebrated, to the entire nation. But somehow, luckily, our works surpassed the boundaries and became a worldwide sensation, with popular news outlet CNN featuring our story to the global audience,\" said Durjoy. And true it was, the drone shots of the seed bed by renowned nature photographer, Firoz Al Sabah made several rounds on social media, with praises pouring in from all corners of the world for the remarkable flair of the agricultural farmers. The project also highlighted the works of the jute artisans for their innovative scarecrow construction, the bamboo artisans, the distinctive fabric weavers, and the satranji (handcrafted rug) weavers of the district. \"We took the virgin (never-been-farmed) land on lease, to grow vegetables on a designed seedbed, with 'zero use' of modern-day technology or any sort of harmful pesticides. The seedbed had been shaped in the form of a buffalo and then when we took a drone shot, it turned out to be a huge sensation, with incredible representation of the ancient farming methodologies. My personal feeling is that I have been associated with a huge number of artists over the years, but Bhumi educated me in ways that are beyond comprehension. And I am glad to have been associated with such an auspicious project from the planning stage.\" \"I also want people at large to know that DBF (Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation) does not believe in abandoning a community after a project work is completed; we keep regular contact with the artisans associated with Bhumi till date, and help them through every means possible, whenever necessary,\" he said. Inquired about the future prospects of similar projects, Durjoy revealed that he always wants DBF to be associated with similarly industrious and inspiring projects. \"Art is existent everywhere, in every form in every place and bringing that art to the forefront is our duty. DBF wants to inspire people. My dream is to establish DBF as a platform, where young, rising artists with impeccable talents can come and connect with ease. We are here to represent Bangladesh in its truest form, from the peripheries to the urban cities,\" said Durjoy. At the end of our rendezvous with Durjoy Rahman, we had one question placed in front of him. How do you want people to remember DBF in the long term? \"Just as an institution that is trying hard to make an impact on human lives via art and culture,\" reflected the art connoisseur.   \n",

   "text":"  Busby:  As the Secretary [of State] noted, I think we’re concerned about backsliding on human rights around the world. And that includes in Asia and in China, specifically in places like Xinjiang, Tibet, and elsewhere. I think that is one of the trends that is remarkable at this point. Busby: As the Secretary highlighted today, one of the priorities for the Biden-Harris Administration is not only to take action ourselves, but to work in combination with other like-minded countries. And I think we’ve seen that so far with regard to Burma and with regard to China. We’ve seen concerted efforts made in a coordinated fashion to speak out on human rights abuses in China and in Burma, and also to take concrete action, such as the sanctions that have been invoked in China by the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union, and a similar imposition of sanctions by a group of countries with regard to those responsible for human rights abuses in Burma. Busby: I think it’s a very, very high priority for this administration, for the United States, not to be acting alone but to be acting in concert with our allies. That will continue to be a very high priority for the administration. Busby: We’re extremely concerned about the backsliding in Hong Kong, and we’ve indicated on many occasions that we think the actions taken by Beijing contravene the agreements previously made on the autonomous status of Hong Kong. So we’re very, very concerned, and to date we’ve taken a number of actions, including sanctions against officials responsible for those policies in Hong Kong and for abuses committed by those individuals. So those of the sorts of actions we have taken so far. Busby: Well, I think that in the short term, sometimes you don’t see changes in behavior. But I think over the long term, when there are sanctions like these imposed, you do see changes. And again, the priority for this administration will not be simply to act on our own, but to act in combination with our allies—like the UK, like Canada, like the European Union. And I think by acting together we can have a much greater impact on Chinese thinking, and now on Chinese behavior. Busby: The Secretary has indicated his firm commitment to appoint a Special Coordinator on Tibetan Issues, so I think there’s no question that he will be making that appointment. It’s still early in the administration, so I don’t think we can say when and who that person will be, but the Secretary of State has made crystal clear that he intends to appoint such a person. Busby: I can’t speak to who would be appointed in that position going forward. That would be a decision for the Secretary to make, but I’m confident that the Secretary will appoint someone who is capable and competent in carrying out this role. Busby: We’re very concerned about the reports about forced labor in Tibet. And frankly we’re concerned about reports of forced labor wherever it may be occurring. When those reports came out, we were deeply concerned to read about this. As you may know, there are laws in the United States addressing the issue of forced labor, precluding the importation of goods made with forced labor, so I think we will be looking at some of these authorities in deciding how we are going to respond to the allegations of forced labor in Tibet. Busby: I think that those of us who are committed to human rights always have to be hopeful in our actions—be they reporting on human rights abuses around the world, be they imposing sanctions, be they adopting other policies that will lead to improvements in human rights. So yes, I would say that we have to be hopeful in order to continue with our important work. Busby: I don’t want to get out ahead of any trip that I or the president or the Secretary might make. But we do recognize the important role played by the Dalai Lama. And we continue to urge the Chinese government to engage in a direct and constructive dialogue with the Dalai Lama.",

The competition between the two Muslim Supremacy goes long back in the Muslim world. The geopolitical rivalry has severed over the years, beginning from 2018. The time when Saudi Arabic agents killed the journalist Jamal Khashogi in the Kingdom Istanbul. Turkey is  tourist magnet but still has a struggling economy. Saudi Arabia is taking full advantage to destroy their economy and expand their economic struggles. Turkey Exporters of textiles have complained regarding the delays at Saudi’s end. Riyadh has blocked the attempts of Turkey to import which could possibly destroy Global supply chain. The campaign is targeting Turkey’s covid-19 hit economy. Turkey is likely to lodge complain this act to the world trade organization. Saudi Government has sought distance from the campaign. The government has blamed that the citizens are boycotting Turkey products.  Rivalry between the two Muslim Supremacy could lead to cancellation of visas from the side of Turkey. It is a kind of a political showmanship. Saudi considers Turkey as external threat, is the reason wht they are taking such extreme action.  Saudi Arabia is the 15th biggest export market with textiles, chemical, furniture and steel among among the main items purchased. Turkey stands to lose more in the short term from disruptions to bilateral trade relations. However, Saudi Arabia must tread carefully to minimise any reputation- related costs associated with global perceptions of its trade policy.",

   "text":"US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that a Coronavirus vaccine is “ready” and going to be announced “within weeks” to combat the deadly disease that has killed over 223,000 Americans, as he debated with his Democratic challenger Joe Biden for the final time before the presidential election. The debate, just less than two weeks ahead of the crucial presidential elections on November 3, started with opening remarks by both the candidates, when the mike of the other was muted. The coronavirus dominated the opening minutes of the Trump-Biden face-off with President Trump terming the contagion a worldwide problem . This has been a worldwide problem, but I’ve been congratulated by many countries on what we’ve been able to do, he said at the debate held in Nashville, Tennessee. “We have a coronavirus vaccine that’s coming, it’s ready. It’s going to be announced within weeks and it’s going to be delivered, the President said, adding that companies like Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer are doing very well on that front. Trump claimed that he had done a good job with a worldwide pandemic, saying the country needs to learn to live with it. Responding to the President, Biden said that Trump has no plan. He always says people are learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it, Biden said. I will take care of this. I will make sure we have a plan, the former vice president said. Biden said that this is a dark winter as he came down heavily on the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic. Trump praised the US response to the pandemic, claiming that the crisis is going away . On the question of lockdown, Trump said: We don’t have the ability to lock ourselves in basement . We’re not going to shut down and we have to open our schools, Trump said. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, Trump said. According to Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, the coronavirus has so far infected more than 41 million people and killed over 1.1 million people globally. The US is the worst affected country with over 8 million cases and 223,000 deaths.",

   "article_summary":"Obama warned in 2014, that we must be ready to deal with an epidemic",
   "text":"Did former United States President Barack Obama predict the seriousness of a potential outbreak? Turns out, the Obama administration had been pushing for a universal healthcare infrastructure to globally deal with a potentially “air borne” pandemic, similar to the ongoing coronavirus crisis. “We have to put in place an infrastructure,  not just at home but also globally. That allows us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly”, he said in a briefing. \r\n \r\n Obama warned in 2014, that we must be ready to deal with an epidemic. “So that if and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish flu, crops up, five years or a decade from now - we’ve made the investment - and we’re further along to be able to catch it”, the former president had asserted. Obama called for more pandemic preparedness following the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which was then seen as a global threat. \r\n \r\n “The funding we’re asking for is needed to keep strengthening our capacity here at home so we can respond to any future Ebola cases.. It’s needed to help us partner with other countries to prevent and deal with future outbreaks and threats before they become epidemics”, Obama had said. He added how the world had got lucky in terms of the Swine Flu, which had subsided on its own. “We were lucky with H1N1 that it did not prove to be more deadly. We can’t say we’re lucky with Ebola because obviously it’s having a devastating effect tin West africa, but it is not airborne in its transmission”, he had said. However, coronavirus is airborne, and is way more deadly than any epidemic seen in recent history. “There may and likely will come a time in which we have both an airborne disease that is deadly“, he said predicted. Looks like his prophecy turned out to be true. “It’s not just insurance, it is knowing that down the road, we’re gonna continue to have problems like this - particularly in a globalised world”. \r\n \r\nHe had earlier written in an oped in New York Times back in 2005 - “We recommend that this administration work with Congress, public health officials, the pharmaceutical industry, foreign governments, and international organisations to create a permanent framework for curtailing the spread of future infectious diseases”. “I cannot think of a better example of an area where we should all agree than passing this emergency funding to fight Ebola and to set up some of the public health infrastructure in the world to deal with potential outbreaks in the future”. The incumbent US president Donald Trump had received reports about the seriousness of COVID-19 as early as March but continued to discount those well into March. At a briefing he said that the virus would go away by April because of the heat. But it has now killed over 30,000 people in the United States alone. According to new projections, 100,000-240,000 people are expected to die of the virus in the US alone.",

   "article_summary":"Virgin Australia said in a statement that it was deferring delivery of its first batch of planes from November 2019 to July 2021. ",
   "text":"Virgin Australia said on Tuesday it had delayed delivery of its order of 48   aircraft over safety concerns, following two deadly crashes. The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since mid-March following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight and an earlier Lion Air crash in Indonesia, which killed a total of 346 passengers and crew. Virgin Australia said in a statement that it was deferring delivery of its first batch of planes from November 2019 to July 2021.  \"Safety is always the number one priority for Virgin Australia. As we have previously stated, we will not introduce any new aircraft to the fleet unless we are completely satisfied with its safety,\" Virgin Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said. \"We are confident in Boeing's commitment to returning the 737 MAX to service safely and as a long-term partner of Boeing, we will be working with them through this process\", Scurrah said. Virgin also said it was shifting some of its orders of 737 MAX 8s to Max 10s while keeping the total at 48 planes. The Virgin announcement comes as Boeing executives faced several shareholder challenges Monday at its annual general meeting, with the crisis raising questions about whether the aerospace giant put profits ahead of safety to market a new narrow-body plane. The US firm has said both crashes involved erroneous information generated by the anti-stall system. But it has defended the design of the MAX saying multiple factors can contribute to catastrophic accidents. Boeing expects the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct a test flight of a software fix for the anti-stall system soon.",

   "text":"In view of rising Covid-19 cases, Delhi government Saturday announced a slew of curbs on social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious activities, while Maharashtra seemed all set for a harsher and longer lockdown, the date and time for which is yet to be finalised. An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday.   In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm. Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.",

   "text":"Kolkata Knight Riders have opened their account with a win against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in their first game of the 2021 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).   side defended the 187-run target by 10 runs as it proved to be too much for Manish Pandey in the end after they lost a few wickets in quick succession. Pandey anchored the innings for the Sunrisers with a 44-ball 61* with a strike rate of 138, but the target needed for him to play a little bit quicker as it put too much pressure on the other batsmen to get going from the outset. Hard-hitting all-rounder Abdul Samad did hit a couple of lusty blows after coming in at No 7 was it was too late as the required run-rate had gone out of the reach for the SRH side. They didn't have a great start to their innings both the openers by the third over, however, a 92-run partnership between Jonny Bairstow and Pandey came to the rescue for the Sunrisers. Both brought up their fifties and after settling down took the attack to the KKR bowlers. However, Bairstow got restless after playing three dots in the 13th over bowled by Pat Cummins and he hit straight into the hands of the backward point fielder.  The wicket came at the right moment for the KKR but wrong for the SRH as they just started to amp up towards the 188-run target on a slowish pitch. Sunrisers then lost a couple of more wickets and the innings suddenly lost the momentum and it got to a sluggish end and they fell short of the target despite Pandey and Samad being there at the end. Earlier,   played a decisive cameo of 22 runs off just 9 balls to help KKR finish on a high after they lost four wickets in just 14 runs. Nitish Rana and Rahul Tripathi stitched a 93-run partnership to give KKR much-needed momentum as the duo ripped apart the Sunrisers' bowlers. Rana, who recovered from COVID-19 last week came out all guns blazing and nine fours and four sixes in his knock of 80 runs. While Tripathi was the aggressor hitting fifty off just 28 balls.",

   "text":"LONDON: World number three Rafa Nadal says he is fully fit and confident about his preparations as he begins his claycourt season at the Monte Carlo Masters, with one eye on the pursuit of a 14th French Open crown. The Spaniard has not played a competitive match since his Australian Open quarter-final loss to Stefanos Tsitsipas, having skipped a series of tournaments due to a back injury sustained in Melbourne. Chasing a record-extending 12th title in Monte Carlo, Nadal has been awarded an opening round bye and will open his campaign in the second round against either Federico Delbonis or Adrian Mannarino. \"An important part of the season has arrived for me,\" Nadal, 34, told a news conference on Sunday. \"I think I did the right work to be ready. I'm happy the way that I am playing, for the moment my body is in good shape. \"I am confident. I'm practising well these couple of days here in Monaco before the tournament starts. So I feel ready.\" The 20-time Grand Slam champion is not the only member of the Nadal family to make the trip to Monte Carlo this week, with his uncle and former coach Toni travelling to the Principality as the new member of Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime's coaching team. \"He knows a lot about this sport,\" Rafa said. \"I am sure that it's going to be an important help for Felix.\" Toni, 60, decided to step down as Rafa's coach in 2017 and concentrate on running the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca. Ahead of the 2021 season, Auger-Aliassime spent more than a week training at the academy and approached Toni to join his team. \"I am happy for Felix. I am happy for myself, too,\" Nadal said. \"I am happy to see my uncle here, see him here, spend time with him here on the Tour again. That's a positive thing.\"",

Bologna had plenty of chances to edge in front in the first half, but their wastefulness in front of goal proved costly as Mayoral broke clear on the counter before slotting home one minute before halftime. The chances dried up for the visitors after the break, as Roma claimed a first league win in their last four games with ease.

   "text":"TURIN, Italy: Juventus eased to a 3-1 victory over Genoa on Sunday (Apr 11) to keep alive their faint hopes of making it 10 successive Serie A titles this season. The champions raced into a comfortable lead inside 22 minutes thanks to goals from Dejan Kulusevski and Alvaro Morata, the Spanish striker converting after Cristiano Ronaldo had hit the post. Juventus have not been convincing recently, however, and let the visitors back into the match four minutes after the break with Gianluca Scamacca finding the net. Genoa had chances to level, but Weston McKennie stepped off the bench to make sure of the victory 20 minutes from time as third-placed Juventus moved onto 62 points after 30 matches, one behind AC Milan and 12 adrift of leaders Inter Milan. Napoli climbed to fourth in the standings thanks to a 2-0 win at Sampdoria while Sergej Milinkovic-Savic's stoppage-time goal earned sixth-placed Lazio a 1-0 victory at Hellas Verona. AS Roma host Bologna and fifth-placed Atalanta travel to Fiorentina later on Sunday. With  , and   on Saturday, it was important that Juve kept pace at the top of the table, with only domestic honours to fight for. They appeared on course for an easy win after Kulusevski scored his first goal since the end of January before Morata added a second to put Juve in control. Scamacca could have levelled before the break, but was not to be denied early in the second period, and Marko Pjaca wasted a glorious chance to restore parity moments later. But McKennie, making his return to the side after being fined by the club for breaking COVID-19 protocols, raced clear to seal the win.",

   "text":"Authorities in China’s Sichuan province have arrested a well-known Tibetan educator and author who has twice endured lengthy detentions for expressing loyalty to Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and during a period of unrest in the region. Go Sherab Gyatso, a 46-year-old monk at Kirti monastery in Sichuan’s Ngaba (in Chinese, Aba) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, was taken into custody by State Security agents on Oct. 26, 2020 in Sichuan’s capital Chengdu, a Tibetan living in exile with knowledge of the situation recently told RFA’s Tibetan Service, speaking on condition of anonymity. “My source in Tibet confirmed that Go Sherab Gyatso was arrested and his whereabouts are currently unknown,” the source in exile said. “The reason for his arrest is not clear and his family and friends are worried about him.” The source in exile said that Gyatso’s detention was unsurprising in that Chinese authorities “are constantly harassing Tibetans in Ngaba,” particularly those who have studied in India and returned home. “So many restrictions are in place when it comes to movement, as well as life in general,” he said. Chinese authorities exercise strict controls over phone and online communications in Tibetan areas, sources say, and news of Tibetan protests and arrests is often delayed, sometimes for years, from reaching outside contacts. Gyatso authored the book “We Need To Wake Up,” published in 2007 by Gansu Nationalities Press, and several articles detailing the restrictions on freedom of expression that Tibetans endure under Chinese rule. His book followed what reports have said was his four-year detention, beginning in 1998 during a “Patriotic Reeducation” campaign in Ngaba, for possessing a portrait of the Dalai Lama. Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama is widely reviled by Chinese leaders as a separatist intent on splitting Tibet, a formerly independent Himalayan country which was invaded and incorporated into China by force in 1950, from Beijing’s control. The Dalai Lama himself says only that he seeks a greater autonomy for Tibet as a part of China, though, with guaranteed protections for Tibet’s language, culture, and religion. Gyatso was also reportedly detained for a year in 2008 during a period of widespread unrest in Tibet, although the specific reasons for that detention were not immediately clear. RFA spoke with a Tibetan scholar in Tibet who called Gyatso “a very influential figure among the younger generation” of Tibetans. “He is considered a very open-minded person who speaks out about democracy and freedom, and believes that religion should not play any role in politics,” said the scholar, who also declined to be named, citing fear of reprisal. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans’ political activities and peaceful expression of ethnic and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.",

   "article_summary":"The exclusion of a group will not lead to implementation of peace agreement and that it is fraught with the risk of hostilities, says Lavrov",
   "text":"Batting unabashedly for the need to have the Taliban as part of the peace process in Afghanistan, Russia on Tuesday termed it a “movement that is part of Afghan society”. In remarks that raised eyebrows at a joint press conference in the presence of external affairs minister S. Jaishankar after detailed bilateral talks with him, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said the participation of all Afghan political groups was necessary in the peace talks “otherwise, it is not going to be stable”. A concerned and apprehensive New Delhi meanwhile told Moscow that “for India, what happens in Afghanistan impacts its security directly”, and that “the (Afghan) peace process must be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe”, adding that a “political solution should mean an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan”.       But in a clear indication of a “tilt” towards the Taliban, an unfazed Mr Lavrov told reporters that the “exclusion of a group” will “not lead to implementation” of a peace agreement and that it is “fraught with the risk of hostilities”. He said it “would be sad” if the Afghan peace process “breaks down”. The Russian stand and perceived softness towards the Taliban is seen by observers as further evidence of the new found proximity between Russia and Pakistan, that is seen as the main backer of the Taliban. Mr Lavrov also left for Islamabad Tuesday evening, where the Afghan peace process will no doubt be further discussed by him.   The Russian foreign minister said both his country and India had agreed to keep in “close touch” on the situation in the strife-torn nation, pointing to the contributions that “neighbours and old powerful actors” in the region can make in the Afghan peace process. He also referred to the “Moscow format” in this regard, a reference to recent Afghan peace talks in the Russian capital that had involved the Taliban. Mr Jaishankar meanwhile said: “One question on which we spent some time is the unfolding developments in and around Afghanistan. As you all know, the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process conference took place last week ... (in Dushanbe). There have been other discussions of a bilateral or plurilateral nature as well. Many more can be expected in the coming days. For India, what happens in Afghanistan impacts its security directly. I shared our approach that a durable peace there would require harmonising interests of all, both within and around that country. The peace process must be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe. And a political solution should mean an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan.”   It may be recalled that India is strongly backing Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who is hated by the Taliban. Mr Jaishankar had only recently “reassured Afghan foreign minister Haneef Atmar of India’s long-term commitment towards a peaceful, sovereign, stable and inclusive Afghanistan where the rights of all sections of the society are protected within a democratic constitutional framework”. It may be recalled that in February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had expressed concern over the increasing violence in the war-torn nation and had called for a ceasefire and an immediate end to violence in Afghanistan. Mr Modi had reiterated New Delhi’s stand in favour of a peace process that is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled, while pointing out how innocent citizens, journalists and activists are being targeted in a cowardly manner in the strife-torn nation, even as a desperate Taliban continues to mount deadly terror attacks in that country against its targets including women.   It may also be recalled that recently, while seeking a role for India as well apart from a host of other countries in the Afghan peace process, the United States under the Joe Biden administration had proposed a “UN-led peace conference in Turkey attended by foreign ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and the US”.  India, which has already successfully carried out several development projects in Afghanistan, had in February announced that it would build a second dam there -- the Lalandar (Shatoot) Dam -- to meet the drinking water needs of Afghan capital Kabul. This is the second major dam being built by India in Afghanistan, after the India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam (Salma Dam), which was inaugurated in 2016.  ",

   "article_summary":"International law does not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres in EEZ without the consent of the concerned state, says Delhi",
   "text":"The US Navy carried out a “freedom of navigation” operation in India’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near Lakshadweep Islands earlier this week, without New Delhi’s prior consent, to challenge what the US said were India’s “excessive” maritime claims, a official US statement said. The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer   on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said.   The US Navy said it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state.   The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.”   The MEA added: “The   was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile, the US Seventh Fleet said: “  (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”   It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.  ",

   "text":" Enraged by the killing of four Trinamul Congress workers by Central paramilitary forces in Coochbehar during the fourth phase of Assembly election in West Bengal on Saturday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused Union home minister Amit Shah of being a \"conspirator\" of the shooting and demanded his resignation.  Erupting in fury, Ms Banerjee told a TMC rally in North 24 Parganas, \"A dangerous incident has left me in pain. The Central forces gunned down four persons at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar. Another death also happened in the morning. From the very first day I have been vocal. Central forces are not my enemy. But the way it killed four voters standing in the queue only proved the Union home minister's conspiracy that has been on. Mr Shah, you must resign as you are the conspirator.\"   She alleged, \"After killing so many people, the BJP now claims the firing was in self-defence. They must hang themselves in shame! Where did they get so much audacity from? Where do so many atrocities originate from? BJP knows it has lost in the polls. That is why they are killing the voters and workers. What fault did they commit?\" Puncturing the Trinamul Congress supremo's claim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was also in the state for poll campaign in two districts, referred to Ms Banerjee's alleged provocation to attack the Central forces and warned her and her party workers against hooliganism.   He mourned the loss of lives and urged the Election Commission for strong punishment for the accused of the killings. Addressing a BJP rally in Siliguri of North Bengal, Mr Modi said, \"What happened in Coochbehar is very sad. I mourn the loss of lives in the killings. My condolences with their families. Didi and her goons have been panicked to see the support of the people for the BJP. Seeing herself losing the chair, Didi has stooped to such a low level! But I want to make it clear to the TMC, Didi and her goons that their muscle-flexing will not be allowed in Bengal. I request the Election Commission to take stringent action on the accused of the incident.\"   He however told Ms Banerjee, \"But your tricks to provoke the people in attacking the Central forces on poll-duty and obstruct the polling process will not be able to save you. Your violence after a decade-long misdeed cannot save you. People are casting their votes in large numbers for BJP. North Bengal has shown it.\"  Standing by the Central forces for their role in the poll duty, Mr Modi observed that the TMC chief, not the forces, has become the biggest trouble in the polls.  ",

   "text":"Tibetans living outside their China-ruled homeland will go to the polls April 11 in a third and final casting of ballots for leader, or Sikyong, of Tibet’s Dharamsala, India-based exile government, the Central Tibetan Administration, with final results announced on May 14. Lobsang Sangay, a Harvard-trained scholar of law, has served two consecutive five-year terms as Sikyong, an office filled by candidates elected since 2011 by popular vote, and will leave that post when his present term expires in May. The Tibetan diaspora is estimated to include about 150,000 people living in 40 countries, mainly India, Nepal, North America, and in Europe. Penpa Tsering, a former speaker of Tibet’s exile parliament, and Aukatsang Kelsang Dorjee, a former representative of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama—frontrunners in the current race after prevailing in earlier voting—are pledging strengthened efforts to win greater freedom in Tibet, with plans for outreach to foreign governments and support groups worldwide. Tibet’s new Sikyong must continue to push for talks with China on greater autonomy for Tibet, “but I am not very hopeful that the Chinese government will initiate a dialogue with the Tibetan administration,” Aukatsang said, speaking to RFA’s Tibetan Service in a recent interview. “So we must work towards enhancing the Tibetan freedom struggle, and the Tibetan administration must focus more on that struggle than on the administration alone,” Aukatsang said. “Engaging and garnering support from the Indian government and its citizens is something I will work more towards.” Also speaking to RFA, Penpa Tsering promised to pursue “all possible ways to communicate with China, whether it’s directly or indirectly.” “But until Tibet’s issue is resolved, my primary focus of work will be to make sure that Tibetans inside Tibet are happy, and also to find ways to reject China’s assimilationist policies on Tibet’s language, culture, religion, and environment, along with the growing influx of Chinese [migrants] into Tibetan areas.” “These issues will remain the most important, and only after these will come the issue of looking after the welfare of the Tibetans living exile,” Tsering said. The May 14 election results will also seat 45 members of the exile Tibetan Parliament in its new, seventeenth session, with 10 candidates representing each of Tibet’s three traditional provinces—U-tsang, Kham, and Amdo—and two representatives from each of Tibet’s four major schools of Buddhism and the pre-Buddhist Bon religion. Two members will also be voted in to represent each of the exile Tibetan communities in North and South America and Europe, and one from Australia and Asia, excluding India, Nepal, and Bhutan. In interviews with RFA, Tibetan residents of India expressed different levels of familiarity with the candidates on offer, with some saying they were well informed, and others admitting to confusion. “I’ve thoroughly studied the background of all these candidates, because they will be representing six million Tibetans,” said Lobsang Lungtok, a resident of South India, including in that figure the number of Tibetans still estimated to be living in their traditional homeland. “I want honest and dedicated persons to be present [in parliament],” he said. “Because there are so many candidates running for parliament, I am very confused,” Tenzin Choekyi, another South India resident, said. “Therefore, I am relying on the news media and social media such as Facebook to help me make my decisions.” Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force 70 years ago, following which the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world. Divisions persist in the Tibetan exile community over how best to advance the rights and freedoms of Tibetans living in China, with some calling for a restoration of the independence lost when Chinese troops marched into Tibet in 1950. The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) and the Dalai Lama have instead adopted a policy approach called the Middle Way, which accepts Tibet’s status as a part of China but urges greater cultural and religious freedom, including strengthened language rights, for Tibetans living under Beijing’s rule. Both frontrunners in the current contest for Sikyong support the Middle Way. The outgoing Sikyong, Lobsang Sangay, has had some success in his two terms of office, winning an annual commitment from the United States of $9 million and a large grant from Congress to support the Tibetan exile community, two Western experts on Tibet wrote in a March 31 article in East Asia Forum. “But Sangay had no success in the exiles’ primary objective: persuading China to allow Tibet a ‘high degree of autonomy’ in return for the Dalai Lama accepting Chinese sovereignty over his former country,” said Robert Barnet, of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, and Cornell University’s Allen Carlson. The challenge facing Tibet’s exile leadership now will be to move away from media campaigns and appeals for legislative support to “detailed, pragmatic strategies demonstrating shared interests with [other] governments,” Barnett and Carlson wrote, adding that deepened relations with India’s leaders will be especially important. “But while India’s hospitality towards the exiles has been unwavering, its strategic interests generally converge with those of the exiles only when its relations with China sour,” they wrote. “A strategy needs to be developed that is seen by New Delhi as benefiting its interests in fair weather or foul,\" Barnet and Carlson said. Nine rounds of talks on greater autonomy in Tibetan areas of China were held between high-level Chinese officials and envoys of the Dalai Lama beginning in 2002, but stalled in 2010 and were never resumed.",

   "text":"A North Korean trade representative in China tasked with bringing in a million U.S. dollars a year for the Pyongyang regime took his life when the coronavirus made raising the funds impossible, fellow traders in China told RFA. The trader, stationed in the Chinese city of Dandong on the border with North Korea’s Sinuiju, was in charge of selling rare-earth elements mined in North Korea, for use in Chinese manufacturing. At the beginning of the pandemic in Jan. 2020, Pyongyang and Beijing shut down their 880-mile border and suspended all trade and traffic, leaving the man with no way to deliver the ore to China. Sources told RFA the trader was still on the hook for the $1 million even though he now had no way to make the money. “In February, a North Korean trade worker took his life in Dandong. The coronavirus made it so there was no hope of resuming North Korea-China trade. He had no way to meet the foreign currency goals he had been assigned,” a Chinese citizen of Korean descent told RFA’s Korean Service March 27. “He was a skilled businessman who earned a lot of foreign currency by smuggling ore concentrates into China… with an annual assignment of $1 million,” the source said. Ore concentrate from North Korea cannot be legally exported due to international sanctions aimed at depriving Pyongyang of cash and resources that could be funneled into its nuclear and missile programs. “He opened offices in Dandong and Dalian, selling molybdenum and cerium concentrates. He was a member of the Chilsung trading company, which is under Office 39, and he earned more through smuggling than official trade,” said the source. Formally the Central Committee Bureau 39 of the Workers' Party of Korea, the organization charged with procuring funds for Kim Jong Un was set up in the late 1970s under the rule of regime founder Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un’s grandfather. The office has foreign currency-earning agents in many countries, and they are expected to earn money regardless of the economic circumstances. RFA reports from the past year documented how trade officials in charge of North Korean laborers in China were begging to find work for them after opportunities dried up due to the pandemic. The pressure to meet the earnings goal is so high for trade workers sent abroad, and the ore trader had been a valued asset to the regime. “We know that this trade worker was seen as a very loyal trade worker by the authorities. He regularly met his assigned earning goals by smuggling the rare metals, and he also sent a large amount to Pyongyang in loyalty funds each time,” the source said, referring to cash payments demanded by the regime. “But we found out that after coronavirus hit trade, he had been covering the funding assignment by taking out loans from his Chinese counterparts because smuggling ore concentrate was impossible,” said the source. Another source, a Chinese citizen of Korean descent from Dalian, about 171 miles west of Dandong, confirmed the death to RFA. “The other North Korean trade officials are greatly discouraged by his suicide because he had once been a very successful trader,” the second source said. “He was a man in his 50s who specialized in smuggling ore concentrates,” the second source said, confirming that he regularly met his state-assigned foreign currency targets in excess of $1 million each year. “Because such a competent trade worker took his own life due to all the pressure, the North Korean authorities exempted trade workers in China from paying their assignments until the coronavirus situation subsides,” said the second source. RFA reported earlier this month that trade workers in China were temporarily exempt from their currency earning obligations, but at that time it was not known that the ore concentrate smuggler’s death may have been the catalyst. “For nearly a month after the suicide, the authorities in Pyongyang refused to receive the body, saying it was due to the coronavirus. The body could not be buried in the mountains in North Korea, so they cremated it without any documents,” the second source said. “Because the trade worker is a citizen of North Korea, they cannot put his remains in a Chinese columbarium, so they just keep it in a storage room. During his lifetime, he was busy earning foreign currency and gave a lot in loyalty funds, but now they won’t even take his remains and he’s stuck in a storage room in China.” According to another RFA report, North Korean state companies this month began hoarding molybdenum ore. Sources said the hoarding caused a spike in molybdenum prices inside North Korea, and that it could be seen as an indication that trade with China could resume soon. North Korean trade workers dispatched abroad often run afoul of international law when trying to meet their foreign currency targets. Earlier this month, Mun Chol Myong, a trader assigned to earn foreign currency in Malaysia, became the first North Korean national to be extradited to the U.S. He is accused of laundering money through the U.S. financial system as a means to evade sanctions and provide luxury items to North Korean elites. The extradition caused Pyongyang to break off relations with Malaysia, and RFA reported that trade officials in China feared that the diplomats in the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur could face punishment upon their return to North Korea.",

   "text":" Jharkhand Lockdown, Dhara 144 in Jharkhand, Jharkhand News पूरे देश की तर्ज पर झारखंड में भी बढ़ता कोरोना वायरस का दायरा झारखंड के लोगों की मुश्किलें बढ़ा रहा है। जिस तेजी से संक्रमितों की संख्‍या बढ़ रही है, उससे फिर से संपूर्ण लॉकडाउन की संभावना से इंकार नहीं किया जा सकता। हालांकि, अब भी सरकार ने पूरे राज्‍य में धारा- 144 के तहत निषेधाज्ञा लागू की है, रात में 8 बजे के बाद तमाम दुकानें बंद रखने का आदेश दे रखा है। बावजूद नए इलाकों में कोरोना संक्रमण तेजी से फैलता जा रहा है। ऐसे में लोगों की घर-बाहर की आजादी पर ग्रहण लगने के आसार अभी से दिखाई देने लगे हैं। यदि कुछ दिन और ऐसे ही हालात बने रहे तो संक्रमण नियंत्रण के प्रयासों को तगड़ा झटका लगेगा। हालात कुछ-कुछ पिछले वर्ष जैसे ही बनते दिख दे रहे हैं। गत वर्ष कोरोना की सीधी मार का असर मार्च के अंतिम सप्ताह से शुरू हुआ था, जिसने रोजी-रोजगार से लेकर अर्थव्यवस्था तक को नाउम्मीद किया जिससे राज्य अब तक नहीं उबर सका है। अब कोरोना की दूसरी लहर कुछ उसी अंदाज में आई है।  \n  स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य विभाग के अनुमानों की बात करें तो आज या कल में राज्य में सर्वाधिक कोरोना वायरस संक्रमितों का रिकार्ड टूट सकता है। राज्य में वर्तमान में 12293 कोरोना संक्रमित मरीज हैं, जो बढ़कर अगले दस दिनों में 24 हजार से अधिक हो जाएंगे। स्वास्थ्य विभाग ने आंकड़ों के आधार पर कोरोना संक्रमण के फैलाव और संभावित संक्रमितों का अनुमान लगाया है। इसके मुताबिक 10 दिनों में रांची में 11 हजार, पूर्वी सिंहभूम में दो हजार और बोकारो, दुमका व जामताड़ा में एक हजार से अधिक कोरोना वायरस संक्रमित मरीज हो जाएंगे।  \n  झारखंड में कोरोना की जैसी स्थिति पिछले साल अक्टूबर माह में थी, वही स्थिति वर्तमान में दोबारा हो गई है। पिछले साल अक्टूबर माह में राज्य में कोरोना के मामले प्रतिदिन औसतन लगभग एक फीसद बढ़ रहे थे। वर्तमान में भी कोरोना की औसत वृद्धि दर (एक सप्ताह में) एक फीसद हो गई है। इसका मतलब यह कि राज्य में कोरोना के जितने मामले अबतक सामने आए हैं उनमें एक फीसद की रोज वृद्धि हो रही है। जैसे, राज्य में शुक्रवार तक कोरोना के कुल 1,34,715 मामले आ चुके हैं। इनमें प्रतिदिन औसत 1,347 मामले बढ़ रहे हैं। इस स्थिति की गंभीरता का अंदाजा इससे लगा सकते हैं कि सिर्फ पांच राज्य महाराष्ट्र, झारखंड, पंजाब, मध्य प्रदेश तथा गुजरात में ही कोरोना की औसत वृद्धि दर झारखंड से अधिक है। अन्य सभी राज्यों में यह औसत झारखंड से कम है। झारखंड में कोरोना मामले की होनेवाली औसत वृद्धि राष्ट्रीय औसत 0.64 फीसद से भी अधिक है। यह भी उल्लेखनीय है कि राज्य में अक्टूबर माह से कोरोना की औसत वृद्धि में लगातार कमी आ रही थी। इस साल फरवरी माह में यह घटकर 0.03 फीसद हो गई थी। \n  पिछली लहर की बात करें तो झारखंड में जब कोरोना पीक पर था तब इसकी औसत वृद्धि दर 28 अगस्त से चार सितंबर के बीच 4.2 फीसद पहुंच गई थी। उस समय छत्तीसगढ़ तथा त्रिपुरा में ही यह दर झारखंड से अधिक क्रमश: सात फीसद और 4.7 फीसद थी। अन्य सभी राज्यों में यह दर झारखंड से कम थी। पूरे देश की बात करें तो यह दर महज 2.21 फीसद ही थी जो झारखंड की दर से लगभग आधी थी। इससे दो सप्ताह पूर्व इस मामले में झारखंड छठे स्थान पर था। \n  उस समय (17-23 अगस्त) झारखंड में कोरोना की औसत वृद्धि दर महज 3.74 फीसद थी। सिर्फ ओडिशा, छत्तीसगढ़, केरल, पंजाब तथा मेघालय में यह दर झारखंड से अधिक थी। इस मामले में दो सप्ताह में ओडिशा, केरल, पंजाब तथा मेघालय झारखंड से बेहतर स्थिति में पहुंच गया था। जानकारों का कहना है कि राज्य में जिस तरह के दैनिक मामले लगातार बढ़ रहे हैं, उसके अनुसार, अगले माह पिछले साल के सितंबर का भी रिकार्ड टूट सकता है। \n    राज्य - 28 अगस्त से 4 सितंबर 2020 - 7-14 अक्टूबर 2020 - 2-9 अप्रैल 2020   \n \n",

   "text":"In view of rising Covid-19 cases, Delhi government Saturday announced a slew of curbs on social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious activities, while Maharashtra seemed all set for a harsher and longer lockdown, the date and time for which is yet to be finalised. An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday.   In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm. Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.",

   "text":"A rare goal from full back Matteo Darmian earned Inter Milan a 1-0 victory over Cagliari on Sunday, as Antonio Conte's side closed on their first Serie A title in 11 years. Juventus however eased to a 3-1 victory over Genoa to keep alive their faint hopes of making it 10 successive Serie A titles this season. Third-placed Juventus moved on to 62 points after 30 matches, one behind AC Milan and 12 adrift of leaders Inter Milan. Struggling Cagliari were proving to be a tough nut to crack in the San Siro, with debutant goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario making several fine saves to keep the league leaders at bay. But the visitors' resistance was broken by an unlikely source in Darmian, whose second league goal of the season in the 77th minute secured Inter a 11th successive league win. \"I like to repeat - these matches are starting to feel like victories are worth six points,\" Conte told DAZN. \"Milan won (on Saturday) and it was important for us to keep our lead. It is not easy but we are getting used to it. \"For many it is the first time being under pressure like this, playing always to win. I am very satisfied with what we are doing.\"  ",

   "text":"Authorities in North Korea have purged a local government official for allowing a coronavirus quarantine center to operate at reduced capacity at a time when Pyongyang is trying to maximize defenses against the deadly virus, sources in the country told RFA. North Korea publicly claims it is virus free, but it has employed strict measures to prevent the spread of the virus through the country, including locking down cities and counties, cancelling major cultural events, and forbidding travel between provinces. In November 2020, the government upgraded the country’s “emergency quarantine posture,” in place since the beginning of the pandemic, to a policy of “ultra-high-level emergency quarantine measures,” all while telling the international community that it had not confirmed a single case. The purged official was the head of a county-level office of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party in North Pyongan province, in the country’s northwest. Unconfirmed reports of his execution are now making other local officials nervous. “In February, the head of the party organization in Uiju county was purged for the ‘crime’ of having disobeyed the Highest Dignity’s order to maximize the coronavirus emergency quarantine,” a North Pyongan official told RFA’s Korean Service Monday, using an honorific term to refer to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They say he was quietly executed under the direction of the Central Party, but this is not confirmed,” said the source, who requested anonymity for professional reasons. According to the source, the purge came after the Central Committee received an anonymous complaint from another Uiju county official. “The complaint said that the head of the party organization gave orders to reduce the capacity of Uiju’s quarantine facilities for suspected coronavirus patients,” said the source. “The Central Party then dispatched a team to investigate the case, and they found that Uiju’s quarantine facility was not operating properly,” the source said. Uiju county had been under financial stress at the time, and had to make some cutbacks, the source explained. “They had insufficient operating funds. The county’s quarantine authorities proposed to the county party that they would tell patients with mild symptoms to self-isolate in their homes, with the high-fever patients using the quarantine center,” said the source. “They reduced the capacity of the quarantine facility with approval. The official who approved the plan was the head of the county’s party organization,” the source said. Operating the center at reduced capacity went against directives not to be lax with quarantine rules. “They made an example out of him for neglecting the Highest Dignity’s order to maximize public quarantine projects during the prolonged national emergency. It rang an alarm for the officials who are themselves becoming less thorough in implementing the quarantine,” said the source. Another source, also from North Pyongan, confirmed the purge to RFA Tuesday, saying that Uiju’s administrative organizations are in chaos due to anxiety on the part of officials. “After the head of the county party organization was purged, the chairman of the People’s Committee was also dismissed for failing to properly manage the quarantine facility,” said the second source, who requested anonymity for security reasons.   “Officials… believe the purge is the result of a power struggle between party leaders. They wonder why the chief secretary of the Uiju county party, who is in charge of the case, was not punished,” the second source said. Authorities held a lecture session for the officials last week, saying that the party leader’s negligence of the emergency situation was a threat to the nation’s existence, according to the second source. “They again delivered the Highest Dignity’s message that mistakes in economic projects can be corrected, but mistakes in implementing the quarantine should not be tolerated,” the second source said, adding that the increased scrutiny was causing officials to feel more anxious. The second source also said that 10 North Pyongan officials, including military personnel, had been purged between March and May 2020 for violating quarantine guidelines, while in December nine officials and others involved with smuggling at the Chinese border in the country’s northern Ryanggang province were purged for the same reason. RFA reported in December that a smuggler was publicly executed the previous month in the northwestern province of North Pyongan for violating emergency quarantine measures by trying to conduct business with his Chinese partners. Sources in that report said ordinary residents in North Korea’s border region felt that the execution was meant to scare them into not complaining that the emergency quarantine measures affect their livelihood.",

And I must acknowledge that those people who got involved were brave. These people are heroes,\" New South Wales Police chief Gavid Wood said. A woman, who was injured in the attack, was taken to hospital. \"We have a female person with a stab wound to the back currently being treated by paramedics and is en route to a Sydney hospital,\" Wood further said. He said the woman's injuries were not life-threatening. Video footage on Twitter showed a young man running across a city intersection and jumping onto the hood of a car, waving what appeared to be a knife covered in blood and shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" and \"shoot me\". The man fell to the ground when the car moved and was confronted by a person holding a chair, the video further showed. Australian media reported that the man was pinned to the ground by some people who were present there. \"We saw the person with a knife over there bleeding,\" a woman present at the Subway store near the scene told news agency Reuters. A video that emerged from the scene showed the man was restrained with the help of chairs and milk crates. \"The cops are here and they blocked the road right now, so we can't go outside. They said: 'It's a crime scene, you can't come out',\" a woman, who declined to give her name, told Reuters. Police said the man was acting alone.",

The legislation was delayed for months by a small group of conservatives from the ruling Liberal Party who rebelled against their leader.  The passage of the bill was cheered by pro-choice advocates, who had staged several large demonstrations in its support in recent months, countered by similarly passionate pro-life rallies. Alex Greenwich, the independent representative for Sydney who introduced the bill, said that he was \"sorry it has taken us so long\" to remove abortion from the criminal code.  \"My deepest gratitude goes to my parliamentary colleagues and to the dedicated women's rights campaigners who have fought toward this for decades,\" he said in a statement. Though prosecutions were rare, the   was only considered legal in Australia's most populous state if the doctor believed the woman's physical or mental health was in danger. The new legislation allows abortions to be performed by a doctor on request up to 22 weeks, beyond which the consent of two doctors would be required. It also makes it illegal for an unqualified person to perform an abortion, with the offence punishable by up to seven years in jail. Amendments made to appease the bill's conservative opponents include tighter regulations on late-term abortions and mandated medical care for any baby born alive following a termination procedure. New South Wales last year introduced \"safe access zones\" around medical clinics and hospitals that provide terminations, a measure aimed at stopping anti-abortion protesters from harassing women.",

In 2016, Russian hackers from other groups were unusually noisy in their efforts to penetrate some state election databases. But Russia was called out and punished for its interference. The group has thus far stopped short of sabotage, but appears to be preparing for some future attack.

   "text":"After more than a year without trade between North Korea and China, who closed the Sino-Korean border to fight the coronavirus pandemic, there are signs that trade could resume in April, sources in China told RFA. In January 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, Pyongyang and Beijing closed their 880-mile border on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers and suspended all trade. The move devastated the North Korean economy, especially in border regions, where a large percentage of local commerce depends on the purchase and sale of goods imported from China. Additionally, smugglers from North Korea who make their living by shuttling goods to and from China suddenly found themselves struggling to make ends meet. Commerce in entire towns dried up and industries that rely on Chinese raw materials could not continue to operate. But this week, Chinese safety inspectors have been spotted on a major bridge connecting the Chinese city of Dandong with North Korea’s northwestern city of Sinuiju. “Yesterday an acquaintance who works at Dandong Station informed me they are inspecting and repairing railroad tracks so international trains between China and North Korea can begin running from early April,” a Chinese citizen of Korean descent told RFA’s Korean Service Tuesday. “They also set up new quarantine facilities in the Dandong and Sinuiju customs offices, which have been closed for more than a year because of the coronavirus, and they are waiting for trade to resume,” said the source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. Inspections and repairs are necessary because trains between the two border cities have not traversed the 74-year-old Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge in so long, the source said. The area near the bridge is a popular tourist spot where visitors to Dandong can catch a glimpse of the reclusive Stalinist state across the river. “We know that only freight cars will be allowed to cross the border, not passenger cars. I heard that North Korea is opening its borders to import food, building materials and agricultural goods, which they need immediately for their economic development plans,” the source said. “The inspectors from Dandong Station have been working on the tracks from morning to evening. They wear fluorescent safety clothes and helmets, so they are clearly visible to tourists around the bridge,” said the source. The source said that trains from China would only be allowed to travel as far as Sinuiju, unlike before the pandemic, when they passed through the border city on their way to Pyongyang, about 140 miles overland. “Perhaps it is because North Korea’s emergency quarantine measures have not yet been lifted, and this is freight-only, not a passenger train,” the source said. The emergency quarantine measures limit movement between provinces and absolutely prohibit any contact with Chinese. Another source, also from Dandong, confirmed to RFA that rail traffic would resume between the two cities in April. “Even if they reopen the border, the movement of people is prohibited and only freight will be allowed,” said the second source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. “Today I saw a number of inspectors at the bridge across the Yalu River. The coronavirus is a huge concern in North Korea, so the economic situation must be pretty serious if they are going to reopen the borders,” said the second source. News that trade between China and North Korea will resume has spread all over Dandong, and trade officials from North Korea and their Chinese counterparts have been feverishly working to get their deals in place ahead of the reopening, according to the second source. “Trade with North Korea has been suspended for more than a year, so traders in Dandong, who are on the verge of bankruptcy, are in a much better mood than before,” the second source said. The second source acknowledged that rumors of a resumption of trade had made the rounds in Dandong many times over the past year, but never came to fruition. “This time it’s different. Given the movement of all the North Korean trade workers in and around Dandong, and the inspections on the Yalu River bridge, the possibility that Sino-Korean trade will resume in April is really raising the expectations of all the traders from both countries,” said the source. In 2019, the last full year before North Korea and China stopped trading, total trade volume between the two countries amounted to slightly more than U.S. $3 billion, according to data from the Korea Trade Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). China was the origin country for 96 percent of North Korea’s imports in 2019 and was the destination country for 67 percent of North Korean exports, according to data published on the website of the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). According to a recent report by the UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights, the border closure caused many North Koreans to starve to death, with children and elderly resorting to begging in the streets or risking execution by breaking laws to obtain food from China. “Prolonged COVID-19 prevention measures have resulted in a drastic decline in trade and commercial activities and severe economic hardship to the general population, causing increased food insecurity,” said the report.",

   "text":"Kolkata Knight Riders have opened their account with a win against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in their first game of the 2021 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).   side defended the 187-run target by 10 runs as it proved to be too much for Manish Pandey in the end after they lost a few wickets in quick succession. Pandey anchored the innings for the Sunrisers with a 44-ball 61* with a strike rate of 138, but the target needed for him to play a little bit quicker as it put too much pressure on the other batsmen to get going from the outset. Hard-hitting all-rounder Abdul Samad did hit a couple of lusty blows after coming in at No 7 was it was too late as the required run-rate had gone out of the reach for the SRH side. They didn't have a great start to their innings both the openers by the third over, however, a 92-run partnership between Jonny Bairstow and Pandey came to the rescue for the Sunrisers. Both brought up their fifties and after settling down took the attack to the KKR bowlers. However, Bairstow got restless after playing three dots in the 13th over bowled by Pat Cummins and he hit straight into the hands of the backward point fielder.  The wicket came at the right moment for the KKR but wrong for the SRH as they just started to amp up towards the 188-run target on a slowish pitch. Sunrisers then lost a couple of more wickets and the innings suddenly lost the momentum and it got to a sluggish end and they fell short of the target despite Pandey and Samad being there at the end. Earlier,   played a decisive cameo of 22 runs off just 9 balls to help KKR finish on a high after they lost four wickets in just 14 runs.

   "article_summary":"Each day of the blockade could be costing global trade some $6-10 billion, according to a study published Friday by German insurer Allianz",
   "text":"The massive container ship which has been blocking the Suez Canal for almost a week started to move on Monday, according to maritime traffic tracking sites, raising hopes the vital global trade route could soon be clear. The MV Ever Given, longer than four football fields, has been wedged diagonally across the canal since Tuesday, strangling world supply chains and costing the global economy billions.   The stern of the boat has now moved away from the canal's western bank, according to the Vesselfinder and myshiptracking sites, a fact confirmed by an AFP source at the canal. The Suez Canal Authority (SCA) had not published any official confirmation, and it is not yet clear when traffic along the canal will resume. But in a statement published at around 5 am local time (0300 GMT), the SCA stated that \"towing manoeuvres to refloat the container ship Ever Given have started with the help of 10 giant tugs.\" Inchcape, a maritime services company, tweeted that the ship had been \"successfully re-floated\" and was \"being secured.\"   A canal official, who requested anonymity, said that the team on the ground had started technical checks, and were reassured that the ship's motor was working. SCA chief Osama Rabie had told an Egyptian news channel at the weekend that salvage crews were working round the clock. They had focussed on efforts to remove sand around the ship, with 27,000 cubic metres (over 950,000 cubic feet) cleared at a depth of 18 metres (59 feet), SCA spokesman George Safwat said Sunday. On Sunday evening a shipping company, Leth agencies, had said Egyptian authorities had decided more tugboats were needed to shift the vessel and had postponed the refloating attempt around Sunday's high tide.   The crisis has forced companies to choose between waiting or rerouting vessels around Africa, which adds a huge fuel bill, 9,000 kilometres (5,500 miles) and over a week of travel to the trip between Asia and Europe. Each day of the blockade could be costing global trade some $6-10 billion, according to a study published Friday by German insurer Allianz. That translates to some 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points of annual trade growth each week. Authorities said 369 ships are currently stalled as they wait for the canal to reopen. Russia offered assistance Sunday, following other countries including the United States that have made similar offers.   In a sign of the knock-on effects, authorities in war-wracked Syria said the crisis had hit its fuel imports from Iran and forced it to ration already scarce supplies. Romania's animal health agency said 11 ships carrying livestock out of the country were also impacted, with the charity Animals International warning of a potential \"tragedy\" affecting some 130,000 animals.",

   "article_summary":"The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people",
   "text":"Germany will deploy AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine for general use only for over-60 year olds, the government said Tuesday, imposing restrictions for younger people taking the jab after several severe clotting cases. Under-60s can still decide to take the vaccine but only following \"consultation with the doctor carrying out the vaccination ... and with an individual risk analysis,\" said ministers of Germany's 16 states as well as the federal health minister in a policy statement.   The World Health Organization and the EU's health watchdog have both deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine safe, but several countries have restricted its use over clotting fears. Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that experts have recorded in recent weeks \"very rare but very serious cases of thrombosis\" in people vaccinated with AstraZeneca. \"They are findings that (Germany's vaccine commission) and finally us, cannot ignore,\" she said. Germany's vaccine commission known as STIKO earlier Tuesday recommended that use of the jabs be halted for under-60s because of \"currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects\" in younger vaccinated people.   It intends to make another recommendation by the end of April on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received a first dose of the vaccine, it said. Pending this decision, ministers said people who are due for their second jab can either choose to take it if cleared by their attending doctor, or they can opt to wait for the commission to make its recommendation. The latest restrictions amounted to a new setback for the vaccine developed by the Anglo-Swedish laboratory. Nevertheless Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany would be able to meet its goal of offering every adult a coronavirus jab by the end of the summer.   Just after it received approval from European regulator EMA for use in the bloc, Germany restricted the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s because of insufficient data. After clearing it for older people subsequently, Germany along with several EU nations suspended its use again in mid-March because of clotting fears. Just over a week after allowing its use again, German authorities have now again halted its use among younger people. Merkel insisted however that it is such careful consideration and transparency that can keep the public's confidence in the vaccine.   \"Trust stems from the knowledge that every suspicion, every individual case will be examined,\" she said. The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people. Germany's medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday. Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week.   On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s \"pending further analysis\". The AstraZeneca vaccine has had something of a rollercoaster ride. Britain, which developed it, staunchly supports its use, South Africa has rejected it outright. France has limited its use to over-55s, while Spain has done the same for under-65s. Germany's vaccination campaign has been sluggish, with official figures showing around 11 percent of the population have received a first dose so far.",

   "text":"\"Why not do it for the sake of exposure?\" inquires Saadman, your classmate, when confronted with the perils of asking for your payment for the sixth logo redesign for his \"groundbreaking\" streetwear startup. In between the freeloaders (guised in the veil of friendship) and the established business firm demanding your services, there is no denying that the come-up of a visual artist is arduous. It is only in the past few years that the industry has gained any real momentum locally. Nonetheless, the question remains:  This creates a dynamic of imbalance between the client and the creator – where the input of the artist is virtually lost. What begins as a pursuit of expressing oneself becomes a slippery slope towards compensating for commercial appeal at the expense of one's own vision. Inevitably, personal projects come to a halt, burnouts occur more frequently and art blocks are omnipresent. In addition, the guilt of feeling like a \"sell-out\" is a telltale to the artist's endeavour. Photographer and motion graphic artist Zunayed Noor, 18, reflects on the general attitude towards experimentation. \"The room for experimentation is nulled in the first place because of the standards set by everyone in the industry, which has become the norm. Clients often don't care about styles as long as you're taking pictures and meeting the criteria,\" he says. \"Even if you take your time with personal projects and lay the groundwork for your visual style, you might not be able to use it commercially due to clients not being flexible about these things.\" On the flip side, Zunayed has also had a client approach him for his distinct style of video editing and even implemented it in their content. These are, of course, exceptions. With little to no room for exploring the limits, the wide majority of creatives on the market end up with a portfolio lacking originality, riddled with bland commercial work. As a result, such portfolios will stand to represent a market clustered with low-quality technical skills. 17-year-old graphic designer Faisal Rahman laments that clients are unwilling to value what the artist has to contribute in the conversation. \"More often than not, they will blow over whatever my thought process for a specific design is and almost demean my input,\" he says. Faisal feels that such a one-sided approach emerges because of a corporate need to implement art and design into their brand, not because they want it. This creates room for conformity. Back in the day, one might have wandered into a print shop somewhere in Nilkhet and asked the computer guy to make a logo in minutes without sparing much thought or cash into it. It is, however, vital that creators learn to cope with feedback and bad clients. Negotiating, setting adequate prices, having a solid grasp of the trade are just a few skills required to make it in an oversaturated industry. While artists have their own set of responsibilities, employers and clients must make sure that an upcoming generation of rising talent is not depleted and have their passion burned out.  ",

   "text":" central bank on Tuesday lowered the cost of borrowing, slashing interest rates for the third time this year amid fears about the flagging domestic economy. The Reserve Bank of Australia announced it had cut rates by another 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent, a decision that brings the country's interest rates to a historic new low. The move is part of efforts to extend a record 28-year run without a recession, in the face of increasing economic headwinds that include stagnant employment levels, low wage growth and high household debt. Resource-rich Australia dodged the worst of the financial crisis but the economy recently recorded its weakest annual growth in a decade, expanding just 1.4 percent in the year to June. RBA governor Philip Lowe said the decision to lower the cash rate was designed to \"support employment and income growth and to provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium-term target\".  \"The economy still has spare capacity and lower interest rates will help make inroads into that,\" he said in a statement following the bank's monthly policy meeting. Lowe has forecast an \"extended period\" of low interest rates will be necessary to achieve full unemployment and reach the bank's inflation target, with the bank remaining \"prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed\". Australia is also feeling the impact of , which have rattled the global economy as central banks worldwide attempt to offset economic risks by lowering rates. One bright light identified by Lowe, however, were recent signs of a turnaround in the Sydney and   housing markets after a prolonged slump.

   "article_summary":"Dozens of new blazes scorched the countryside and the country's largest city was cloaked in hazardous smoke",
   "text":"Australia's Prime Minister on Thursday denied his climate policies had caused   ravaging the country and insisted his government was doing enough to tackle global warming. As dozens of new blazes scorched the countryside and the country's largest city was cloaked in hazardous smoke, conservative leader Scott Morrison defended his climate record, saying Australia was \"doing our bit\". His comments came after weeks spent refusing to speak about the link between climate change and deadly fires described by the emergency services as unprecedented in number and scale for the early bushfire season. As more people in the southeast of the country were told to evacuate their homes and schoolchildren in Sydney were again forced to play indoors, Morrison dismissed mounting calls for action. \"The suggestion that any way shape or form that Australia, accounting for 1.3 per cent of the world's emissions... are impacting directly on specific fire events, whether it is here or anywhere else in the world, that doesn't bear up to credible scientific evidence,\" he told ABC radio. Scientists, former fire chiefs and residents touched by bushfires have all drawn the link between this season's more intense fires and climate change. Drought, unseasonably hot, dry and windy conditions have fuelled the unprecedented blazes. Scientists believe many of those factors are made worse by rising global temperatures. On Thursday bushfires burned across every region of Australia with residents in Victoria warned to leave high-risk areas and officials in New South Wales reporting more than 600 homes have been destroyed in recent weeks. Morrison is facing calls to cut greenhouse gas emissions and rapidly transition to renewable energy -- a sensitive debate in light of Australia's lucrative mining industry. Australia has committed to globally agreed climate targets to help limit warming, but its emissions continue to rise and targets are only being met with the use of some creative carbon accounting, using credits gained in past decades. While Australia's burning of fossil fuels accounts for only a fraction of global emissions, coal dug up Down Under and burned around the world makes the country a major emissions exporter. '  east coast have claimed six lives since mid-October. Now the fire danger has moved into states further south, with more than 60 fires breaking out in Victoria on Thursday, including five at \"emergency\" level, after a so-called \"Code Red\" fire danger was declared for the first time in a decade. Victoria Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said firefighters were batting \"some of the worst conditions that you'd expect to see, often in February or March, and we're seeing them in November\". \"It is incredibly dry, it will continue to get drier as the months go on over this summer, so the conditions we see today are likely conditions that we'll confront over this summer,\" she said. The Bureau of Meteorology said \"large areas\" of central and eastern Victoria broke maximum temperature records for November, including in Melbourne where the mercury reached 40.9 Celsius, while a dramatic dust storm swept through the town of Mildura, turning the sky a vivid orange. Country Fire Authority chief Steve Warrington earlier told people living in high-risk rural areas to leave for the safety of cities. \"We are saying, 'do not be there, do not be there when a fire occurs, because you will not survive if you are there',\" he said. The fire danger was also elevated to \"extreme\" in the island state of Tasmania off mainland Australia's southeastern coast, one of several areas where a total fire ban was declared. For the second time in three days,  , Australia's biggest city and an area that is home to more than five million people, sending air quality plummeting to hazardous levels. In South Australia, the state capital Adelaide was also shrouded in bushfire smoke and residents were being told to stay indoors for health reasons. More than 110 fires are still burning in worst-hit New South Wales and neighbouring Queensland, while in South Australia more than 40 fires broke out during catastrophic fire conditions Wednesday.  The country is bracing for challenging fire conditions to continue throughout the Southern Hemisphere summer.",

   "text":"Each and every day the problem binded with Non renewable energy are rising like pollution ,the limited stock of these resources and the cost for using them. There is one company came up to tackle these problems the Name of the Company is SolarCity SolarCity is a San Mateo, CA-based company. It provides energy services, such as the designing, financing, and installing of solar power systems. Elon Musk, who is mostly known for SpaceX (an aerospace manufacturer) and Tesla Motors (an electric vehicle manufacturer), which are two companies he founded and currently serves as CEO over, co-founded and is the chairman of SolarCity. Elon Musk is the largest SolarCity shareholder, owning 22 percent of the company run by his cousin, Lyndon Rive.  SolarCity’s shares have dropped 60 percent so far this year, as it missed the consensus earnings forecast for three out of four quarters. It’s begun focusing less on installation growth and has instead ramped up loan programs to homeowners buying solar panels. Solar panel technology has been around for over 50 years, but most of us have not had access to the technology until the most recent decade.  Since 2000, a number of companies have tried to bring solar panels to the mainstream with little success. SolarCity, which started in 2006, aims to change that pattern by gaining mass adoption through the alignment of an innovative business model and operating environment.  SolarCity’s business model revolves around 2 value capture streams, Leases/Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and solar energy system sales.  Of the two, PPAs are the most popular and primary growth driver for the company. When SolarCity starts a PPA with a customer, SolarCity installs a system on the customer’s roof for no fee.  For a entire life of a typical 20 year contract, the customer pays for electricity generated from the installed panels at much lower rates than they normally would have paid a utility company.  These rates are also secure being nearly locked in for the 20 years vs. utility rates that trend dramatically upward over time.  SolarCity maintains ownership and service requirements, but they also own what amounts to an annuity like cash flow from the energy the customer utilizes.",

   "text":"A majority of engineering graduates interviewed have leveraged the extra time at home due to the coronavirus-related lockdown in online upskilling programmes that would solidify their resume, according to a survey. Though the lockdown had shuttered onsite operations for most learning organisations, it opened new avenues for the digital ones with 94 per cent saying they have considered learning a new skill during this period to leverage extra time at home that will solidify their resume to sail through the new normal, according to the IP-driven incubation lab, BridgeLabz, survey. The survey is based on online interviews of over 1,100 engineering graduates during August 10-14 across the country. BridgeLabz was set up to bridge the skill-gap among the existing talent pool of engineers by making them job-ready through experiential learning and focused mentorship. Digitisation has emerged as the fourth industrial revolution enabling continuous learning and remote working and is on the verge to redefine the role of upskilling in future-proofing aspirants against market downturns. A majority of students side with the online medium for its ability to provide quick answers and convenience of access when it comes to preferential mode of learning, the survey revealed. About 42 per cent of freshers find live sessions with mentors best for on-the-spot query resolution, while 21 per cent find offline classroom-based training to be a viable learning option. The survey revealed that the trend can be accredited to the experiential learning model and upskilling programmes that allow learners to seek live help from industry experts while they hone their skills leveraging online platforms. About 37 per cent prefer recorded classes for their ease of accessibility from anywhere, anytime while offline mode has least takers as only 21 per cent choose an offline classroom-based learning model, it added. The digital disruption is not only affecting the learning preferences but also the working landscape, the survey opined. A whopping 72 per cent of users want to work remotely as opposed to 28 per cent who wish to work from the office, it found. Besides, the engineering graduates seek more stability with their job profiles owing to the current volatility in the employment market, the survey revealed. When asked about the kind of job roles, 90 per cent of the respondents said they prefer a regular, full-time job. Part-time jobs are no longer popular with coders any more, with only 10 per cent of coders saying they might opt for a freelancing job amidst the current  “It is good to see that coders are utilising their time at home to develop new skills. This will eventually help them stand out from the rest of the crowd who don’t possess the talent critical for the new normal. It is also interesting to see that they are more focused on getting a permanent job to strengthen their position in future. Their approach is increasingly becoming futuristic and it puts the onus on upskilling platforms to provide for the same, BridgeLabz Founder Narayan Mahadevan added.",

   "text":"At least 20 North Korean construction workers died last month when an electrical fire tore through their lodging on their Pyongyang jobsite as they slept, RFA has learned. The workers were part of a quasi-military construction brigade of   tasked with building 10,000 houses in the North Korean capital. They worked long and grueling hours during the day, retiring to their hastily made workers’ dormitory for about three hours of sleep each night. Sources told RFA that faulty wiring in their temporary living quarters started the fire on March 30, and many were unable to escape as it engulfed the entire building. “Late last month more than 20 storm troopers were killed at a residential construction site in Pyongyang where they lived and worked,” a source in Pyongyang told RFA’s Korean Service Monday. “The construction command conducted an investigation and found the cause to be a short circuit in an electrical wire,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. The source said the exhausted workers were unable to evacuate even though the fire lasted only a short while. “The storm troopers’ lodging at the construction site was built in a hurry. The roof and walls were made of boards and vinyl film and the electrical wiring was not properly done. The wires were all tangled, and it caused a short circuit which led to the fire,” said the source. “Because their living quarters were hastily built with flammable materials, it burnt down after only about 10 minutes. If they had been evacuated immediately after the fire started, there would have been fewer casualties… The person who was on night-watch duty had fallen asleep, so many died,” the source said. Authorities give construction managers unrealistic deadlines to complete their projects. The immense pressure forces many outfits to ignore the safety of the workers, according to the source. “Once an accident happens, the authorities put all the blame on the construction site officials, saying it was caused by their negligence,” said the source. “The citizens of Pyongyang are concerned. They say that so many workers are victims of accidents at construction sites, and they do not know how many more must be sacrificed in the future. The construction command knows that the order to complete 10,000 houses in such a short time is unreasonable, but they dare not object to the Central Party’s orders. This is what forces the workers to be sacrificed,” said the source. Another source from the capital confirmed the fire to RFA, saying that there were many workers cramped into the temporary shacks, with some even living in tents. “The living situation for those construction workers is so poor, even though the construction command orders that they take thorough measures for their own safety. But most of the storm troopers fall into a deep sleep as soon as they get to bed,” said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “They are exhausted from 12 to 14 hours of hard labor each day, so that’s why most of the storm troopers in the barracks were killed,” said the second source. Construction deaths increased in North Korea after leader Kim Jong Un took office in 2011 and made large-scale national projects a priority to boost his own profile, according to the second source. “Construction commanders are so eager to achieve results within the deadline set by the party. They never mention safety issues or the unfair sacrifices of the construction workers, and this is causing resentment among the people.” Accidents at construction sites are relatively common but casualties are usually in the single digits. RFA has reported several major construction accidents over the past few years. In May 2015, RFA reported that 20 were killed while working in a hydropower project in the country’s northern Ryanggang province, during two separate spillway tunnel collapses in March and April that year. The 20 were the latest of hundreds killed at the power plant since construction began two decades prior. A year before that, RFA reported that an unfinished 23-story apartment building in Pyongyang collapsed, with possibly hundreds living inside. The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the construction of the apartment building \"was not done properly, and officials supervised and controlled it in an irresponsible manner,\" in a rare disclosure that an accident had happened. Though KCNA did not publish a death toll, a South Korean official told domestic and international media that 92 families may have been living in the apartment complex at the time.",

   "text":"North Korea has set up high-voltage electric fences around an important national landmark in a city near the Chinese border, a precaution authorities say is to defend it from would-be vandals opposed to the regime, sources in the country told RFA. The Kim Il Sung Immortality Tower in the northwestern border city of Sinuiju is one of several such monuments that were built nationwide following the 1994 death of the national founder, grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un. The towers are adorned with slogans that proclaim the elder Kim, and sometimes his son and successor Kim Jong Il, as “eternal presidents” of the country. Authorities claim that Sinuiju is a hotbed for dissidents who would seek to deface the monument just before the country celebrates the “Day of the Sun” on the April 15 birth anniversary of Kim Il Sung, one of the most important holidays in the country. “Installation of the high-voltage electric fences began March 20 and was finished yesterday,” a resident of Sinuiju told RFA’s Korean Service April 3. “High-voltage electricity is flowing through the wire fence, which was installed in a hurry on the orders of the Central Committee [of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party]. It’s impossible for anyone to freely access the tower now,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. The source said the builders installed a door in the part of the fence facing nearby Chongnyon railway station so that people can enter to lay flowers at the tower on April 15 and other holidays. “The authorities suddenly installed a high-voltage electric wire fence and creating an atmosphere of fear surrounding this important landmark because forces resisting the regime could potentially appear in the Sinuiju area.” “Since last year, there have been dozens of officials who have been executed, removed from the party, or dismissed for corruption or failing to follow quarantine orders here in North Pyongan province. So it is natural for the leadership to feel uneasy,” said the source. Another source, a resident of nearby Ryongchon county, told RFA April 4 that Kim Jong Un has been focused on eliminating corruption in the country’s powerful institutions. “He has executed or removed core officials, including the principal of Kim Il Sung Higher Party School, and members of the party,” said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “Most of the purged officials were from the party and administrative agencies in North Pyongan province,” the second source said. Corruption is a way of life for those wielding government power in North Korea. Unable to survive on paltry government salaries, officials are bribed to look the other way by those engaged in illegal activities like smuggling or making illegal international phone calls. Those in higher positions often run the illegal businesses themselves. “Last year a bunch of customs officers from the Sinuiju office were arrested and executed for their corruption, but the purge that really hit home was that of the Kim Il Sung Higher Party School principal, as he was a native of the province,” the second source said. “Even after the Sinuiju customs officers were quickly replaced, government officials in Sinuiju were in turmoil as the provincial party secretary and the head of the security department suddenly disappeared one day. Authorities continue to purge senior officials, and they are saying they want to catch potential dissidents in the North Pyongan area including Sinuiju,” the second source said. A number of officials and residents in the province have been turned against the country’s leadership due to the ongoing purges, according to the second source. “The authorities are creating an atmosphere equivalent to a quasi-state of war by installing high-voltage fences around the Kim Il Sung Immortality Tower. They are trying to tell residents to prepare for contingencies because they don’t know what will happen in Sinuiju.” “We know that the fences will be installed in the parts of the city that border China sooner or later.” A North Korean defector who used to be a high-ranking official in Pyongyang told RFA that Sinuiju is a particularly dangerous part of the country watched closely by the government. “Dissident forces have been deep-rooted there since the Kim Il Sung era [1948-1994]. Authorities are very careful about who they appoint as secretaries for the provincial government and the city party up there,” the former official said. “Even when they investigated the [2004] Ryongchon train explosion disaster, which failed to assassinate Kim Jong Il, the authorities presumed it had been carried out by government officials in Sinuiju and so they first investigated the officials and related people.” Then-leader Kim Jong Il had passed through Ryongchon station on his way back from China just hours before the disaster, which killed about 3,000 people and was caused by “electrical contact caused by carelessness during the shunting of wagons loaded with ammonium-nitrate fertilizer,\" according to state media. Though there was widespread speculation that the disaster was a failed assassination attempt, South Korean intelligence has said it believes the event to have been an accident in a country with a poor industrial safety record and few resources to maintain infrastructure. South Korean lawmaker Thae Yong Ho, a senior North Korean diplomat before he defected, told the South Korean media in 2017 that Kim Jong Il ordered the executions of transportation officials including the country’s railway chief following the 2004 disaster. According to the former Pyongyang official, North Pyongan province has produced many well-known people and organizations opposed to the North Korean government or communism in general, including the late religious leader Moon Sung Myung, who fled to South Korea during the Korean War and founded the Unification Church. The Seoul-based  online newspaper reported in late March that North Korea has begun building electric fences along the Sino-Korean border in Chagang province, with plans to cover the entire 880-mile border. According to that report, Kim Jong Un ordered the fences as a measure to prevent illegal border crossers from bringing the coronavirus into the country.",

   "text":"The United States on Wednesday ordered the departure of non-essential diplomats from Myanmar, amid growing violence following the military coup to oust civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a military crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup.   The junta's violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar's myriad ethnic armed groups. The US State Department said it was ordering the departure of \"non-emergency US government employees and their family members\". The decision was taken to protect the safety and security of staff and their families, the State Department said. World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta cadres with sanctions. But the pressure has not swayed the generals. Saturday, the annual Armed Forces Day, saw the biggest loss of life so far, with at least 107 people killed.   The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar's 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions. Three of them -- the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army (AA) -- on Tuesday threatened to join protesters' fight unless the military reined in its crackdown. While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days.   A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible. The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes. Further strikes were launched on Tuesday, but Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU's head of foreign affairs, said the group would continue its position of \"strongly supporting people's movement against (the) military coup\". The KNU's Fifth Brigade put out a statement on Tuesday condemning the air strikes and warning it had no option but to \"confront these serious threats\" posed by the military.   Around 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes. The Thai foreign ministry said late Tuesday about 2,300 have returned to Myanmar, while about 550 remain in Thailand. Karen activists have accused the Thai authorities of pushing people back and accused them of blocking UN refugee officials from the area. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha insisted that there was \"no influx\" of refugees and that the kingdom's authorities had not \"scared them off with guns or sticks\".   Some Karen people injured in the weekend strikes sought medical treatment Tuesday on the Thai side of the border -- the most serious case was a 15-year-old with a collapsed lung and broken rib. Thai police said they had intercepted 10 parcels containing 112 grenades and 6,000 rounds of ammunition in northern Chiang Rai province that had been destined for Myanmar's notorious border town Tachileik. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Myanmar on Wednesday, requested by former colonial power Britain. The 15 members will meet behind closed doors, beginning with a briefing from the UN's special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener.  ",

   "article_summary":"Some college sexual assault victims welcomed remote learning due to COVID-19 because it was the only form of protection they could get.",
   "text":"Michaela Jackie, who asked that her real name not be used in this story, is a sexual assault survivor who graduated last year from a university in New England. She said her Title IX investigation wrapped the day before her school announced it would transition to remote learning. As a resident assistant, Jackie was on campus for two more weeks to help with the transition. Her assailant was also an RA, and although he had been put on leave from his job in the wake of the Title IX investigation, his RA keycard still gave him access to most buildings on campus including Jackie’s dorm building. The night after Jackie’s perpetrator was notified of her Title IX complaint against him, she found her dorm room whiteboard vandalized. “I can’t sleep now, I’ll sleep soon SLUT,” read the message on her whiteboard. Although Jackie reported the vandalism, and evidence that her assailant had been in the building that night, her school took no action. “I felt extremely unsafe for those couple of weeks we were both on campus,” she said. “Once I left campus, I knew that I was safe. I knew he was far away from me and he couldn’t get to me.” Jackie moved in with her sister a couple of hours away from campus. She still battled panic attacks, flashbacks and online harassment from her perpetrator’s friends, but not seeing her abuser every day on campus allowed her to breathe a little bit easier. “Remote learning was such a relief. I felt like I had so much weight on me, but once I left campus it was taken off,” she said. “The pandemic was a safe haven for me.” Jackie’s school didn’t contact her about how the Title IX investigation concluded until the end of April. The school said there was insufficient credible evidence to find the accused guilty. Emma Taylor, an acting major at a college in northwest New York, told HuffPost she was assaulted on her birthday two years ago, and it left deep trauma: “I don’t celebrate anymore.” Taylor reported her assault in February 2020, a month before the pandemic hit the country. Taylor spent entire nights and days in “debilitating panic attacks” because they were surrounded by triggers just by being on campus. (Taylor uses both “she” and “they” pronouns and is referred to by both in this piece.) Taylor said she only instigated the Title IX investigation after finding it impossible to attend school with her abuser “while staying sane.” So they were thrilled when her school started talking about the possibility of remote learning due to COVID-19 after spring break last March. Taylor’s school concluded her Title IX complaint at the end of April, finding the person she had accused of sexual assault not guilty due to a lack of evidence. Remote learning due to COVID-19 quickly became Taylor’s only option to put distance between her and her assailant. Taking classes online allowed Taylor to eliminate environmental triggers, avoid running into her attacker and stop worrying about which friends supported her or her perpetrator. But her frustration with how her school handled her Title IX case remained. “My disappointment was born the night of the assault and has been growing since to almost completely consume my thoughts at this point. I feel let down, abandoned and nauseous about the school’s handling of my case,” they said. “Remote learning being a lucky last chance at protection was absolutely depressing.” Another unexpected silver lining that came with COVID-19’s remote learning was that survivors were able to be around their strongest support network: their families. Jackie said moving in with her sister and her sister’s family was one of the best distractions she could have asked for.",

   "text":"MILAN: A rare goal from full-back Matteo Darmian earned Inter Milan a 1-0 victory over Cagliari on Sunday (Apr 11), as Antonio Conte's side closed in on their first Serie A title in 11 years. Struggling Cagliari were proving to be a tough nut to crack at the San Siro, with debutant goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario making several fine saves to keep the league leaders at bay. But the visitors' resistance was broken by an unlikely source in Darmian, whose second league goal of the season in the 77th minute secured Inter a 11th successive league win. Inter moved 11 points clear of AC Milan in second with eight games to play while Cagliari remained languishing down in 18th place, five points from safety. With such a healthy lead at the top of the table, Conte shuffled his pack for Cagliari's visit, with Lautaro Martinez and Achraf Hakimi given a rest, but Inter's cohesion did not suffer early on as they created plenty of chances. Christian Eriksen forced the best save from Vicario in the first half - a fine one-handed stop to claw out a goalbound effort from the Dane. As the match wore on, Inter started to look more nervous, and Conte brought Martinez and Hakimi on, with the latter instrumental in brilliantly setting up the chance for Darmian, who celebrated with a jubilant bench. Inter's 12th successive home league win left them needing 14 points from their last eight matches to guarantee the Scudetto.",

   "text":"PARIS: Monaco stayed in contention in the Ligue 1 title race as they beat Dijon 3-0 at home, handing the bottom club a record defeat on Sunday (Apr 11). Stevan Jovetic and Wissam Ben Yedder, twice, found the back of the net after the break to put third-placed Monaco on 65 points with six games left, one behind Paris St Germain and four adrift of leaders Lille. Dijon have now lost their last 12 league games, matching the infamous record of CA Paris in the 1933-34 season. They are on 15 points, 15 behind 18th-placed Nimes who occupy the relegation playoff spot. Later on Sunday, Olympique Lyonnais will move within one point of Monaco if they beat Angers at home. Monaco tested Dijon keeper Saturnin Allagbe with early efforts, but lacked precision in a lively first half. They found a breakthrough five minutes into the second half, however, as Jovetic poked the ball home after Allagbe parried Ben Yedder's penalty into his path following an Ecuele Manga's foul in the area. Ben Yedder doubled the advantage on 63 minutes, chipping the ball past Allagbe after being set up by Jovetic following a bad clearance by the Dijon defence. Ben Yedder rounded it up one minute from time by converting his penalty this time after a foul in the box by Fouad Chafik. He has now scored 17 times in Ligue 1 this season and trails top scorer Kylian Mbappe, who also netted in PSG's 4-1 win at Racing Strasbourg on Saturday, by four goals. Earlier on Sunday, promoted RC Lens consolidated their fifth-place with a 4-1 home victory against Lorient. They lead sixth-placed Olympique de Marseille, who drew 3-3 at Montpellier on Saturday, by three points. ",

   "text":"GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany: Suat Serdar celebrated his 24th birthday by scoring his first Bundesliga goal of the season as basement side Schalke 04 snapped a 12-game winless run to beat Augsburg 1-0 at the Veltins Arena on Sunday (Apr 11). Having failed to score in their past five home games, Schalke broke the deadlock inside four minutes when Germany midfielder Serdar slotted home from close range after Augsburg goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz failed to collect a low cross. Augsburg threatened to equalise through forwards Marco Richter and Ruben Vargas but a disciplined Schalke defence held on to claim only their second league win of the campaign. With six games remaining, Schalke still have work to do if they are to survive the drop as they remain 13 points adrift of the safety zone. Meanwhile, Augsburg are yet to secure their top-flight status and sit 11th with a six-point cushion over the relegation playoff spot. Leandro Barreiro's stunning stoppage-time winner earned Mainz 05 crucial three points in the relegation battle as they came from behind in the second half to beat Cologne 3-2 at the Rhein Energie stadium. The result lifted Mainz up to 14th in the table, five points clear of 17th-placed Cologne in the automatic relegation spot. Cologne remain three points off Arminia Bielefeld in the playoff position.",

   "text":"Women on social media are familiar with the scenario above. In most cases, we tend to brush off such attempts to breach our online privacy, because these things seem relatively harmless compared to the more pressing issues when it comes to women, such as the recent spike in gender-based violence. However, are such acts really that harmless? Women are harassed online in many ways, and unsolicited texts are just the tip of the iceberg, along with friend requests from unknown people. You must have come across revolting comments under pictures of female celebrities or of any woman that goes viral, most of which can be classified under hate speech. You most probably have heard stories of leaked private pictures, videos or information without consent – also known as doxxing – and the devastating toll it takes on the victims. \"I have been harassed online by men on many counts. Often, they were in the form of continuous pestering texts that start off nice, but get more degrading with time. Sometimes, their texts are accompanied by inappropriate pictures or videos,\" shares Fabiha Fairooz*, a freelance writer. \"Once, when I was in high school, a group of boys decided to bully my friends and I in a group chat,\" says Zareen Tasnim*, who is now completing her undergraduate degree abroad. \"They made very weak yet unacceptable attempts at insulting me, which had to do with my financial status, my dual nationality, my looks etc. They were even petty enough to make comments about me sending memes in that group chat.\" This is a serious problem which has only increased during the pandemic since we are forced to spend more time online than ever before. According to a recent report by  , 80 percent of the victims of cyberbullying in Bangladesh are adolescent girls and women in their early twenties. In another report by  , most victims of cyberbullying do not report to the police, hence the statistic does not take into account the cybercrimes that go unreported. The question arises, why don't people report cybercrimes? Anika Anjum Iftee, Head of Content Development and Marketing at WeMen View, a non-profit social welfare organisation which works to raise awareness against cyber harassment of women, thinks that such cases are generally taken less seriously than physical ones. \"It's because there are too many factors to consider. With the ongoing calling out culture, the conversation around things like unsolicited texts could be easily manipulated, which can make the main discourse rather confusing. Also, since how we behave on social media is an evolving process, there is still so much to define and to make laws on concretely. While all of that happens, a lot of us will be unfortunate enough to fall victim to online harassment.\" The fact that technology is evolving too fast for us to catch up on the expanding confines of online harassment rings very true. Almost every day, new strides are being made in technology with more opportunities for harassers to abuse them. In this dizzying mess, no wonder tech-savvy women are struggling to deal with a constant barrage of harassment, both big and small. \"I don't think there's much to do. In my experience of receiving unwanted texts, I find that confronting these men is very draining because most see no wrong in their actions and will continue to verbally abuse you or others,\" Fabiha adds. It is as clear as daylight that the toxic standards most men in this region have been brought up to contribute to their interactions online. The firm belief that they will get away with harassing women in both physical and virtual spaces unfortunately enables them to do so. In addition, the common yet unjust shaming of female victims further encourages these abusers to carry on, as Zareen and her friends had faced, \"This cyberbullying incident was reported to the school management, but they didn't fulfil their promises. Instead, they resorted to victim blaming by accusing us of isolating one of our classmates who egged those boys on, even though we weren't friends with her in the first place.\" For all kinds of abuse, for too long, women have been putting in all the work to rage against the injustice. In the case of cyber harassment, from tightening privacy settings to filing cases, women still carry the burden to take preventive measures. However, prevention is not the only cure, at least in this case. In order to see an end to harassment not limited to the digital realm, education comes first, as Anjum explains, \"Measures should be integrated into the way we socialise from an early stage. At WeMen View, we want to teach children how to respect other genders and expand to do workshops with parents too. Humility and kindness are very important in the process of learning how to behave. Children need to know about the obvious red flags because if we are not aware of the danger, we won't be ready to tackle it.\" In the end, it all comes down to getting acquainted with some very simple, basic concepts: consent and respecting one's personal space, and that these apply to everyone regardless of any parameter that you can think of. If we keep all these in mind, perhaps one day all the spheres we occupy, the virtual one included, can be safe for everyone. * \n 1. The Daily Star (December 10, 2020).  2.

   "article_summary":"American player Glenn Cowan (right) shakes hands with Chinese player Zhuang Zedong(center) after getting off a bus for Chinese players during the 31st World Table Tennis Championships on April 4, 1971 in Nagoya, Japan. Glenn Cowan, who missed a bus for his own team, accidentally boarded a bus for Chinese players, which led to a domino of events that saw the normalization of the China-US relationship. Photo: Collected ",
   "text":"\"We were on the bus and were talking and laughing,\" Zhang, now 80, told AFP. \"But when we realised that an American had come onto the bus, we fell silent.\" The Chinese triple world champion Zhuang Zedong eventually came forward and famously broke the ice, giving Cowan a silk embroidery as a souvenir from China. They did not know it at the time, but it was the spark for China and the United States to begin normalising relations, in what became known as 'ping-pong diplomacy'. Zhang, a doubles world champion and later China's coach, recalled: \"Mr. Zhuang understood that there was a difference between the American people and the American government, and that we should be nice to American people, so he took the initiative to chat with Glenn.\" Photographers captured Zhuang and a 19-year-old Cowan shaking hands and smiling. \"The newspaper came out the next day and it seemed that China and the United States were about to have a relationship,\" said Zhang. Days later, on April 10, 1971 the US team became the first Americans to step foot in China for nearly a quarter of a century when they were invited to play friendly matches in the country. The thaw saw President Richard Nixon visit China in February 1972, and a Chinese table tennis squad visit the US. In 1979 formal relations were established between the two countries. Yao Zhenxu played Cowan, who died in 2004, during the Americans' ground-breaking trip. Yao still remembers the score, he won 21-12, 21-14, and says that Cowan thanked him afterwards for \"a serious game\". The American team were vastly inferior to the Chinese, so the hosts sometimes let their visitors win points in the spirit of sportsmanship and goodwill. Now 74, Yao says that it was only afterwards that he realised that he had played a part in something historic. \"Because of ping-pong diplomacy we changed the world order, and the people of China and the United States started friendly exchanges,\" he said. Yao appeared alongside Zhang in Shanghai on Saturday to mark 50 years of ping-pong diplomacy, with the city authorities hosting an event with speeches and friendly amateur matches. But the anniversary comes at a time when relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated markedly over a number of issues, notably trade, the fate of China's Uyghur minority and a clampdown in Hong Kong. In a recorded speech to mark the 50th anniversary, China's ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, accused some in the US of \"ideological bias and zero-sum thinking\". But he and Chinese state media took a largely positive tone, with Xinhua news agency hailing ping-pong diplomacy's \"wonderful legacy\". Yao and Zhang hope that the spirit of 1971 can help shape future relations between the world's top two economies for the better. \"Everyone knows that the relationship between China and the United States is a bit tense nowadays,\" said Yao. \"We hope that we can agree to disagree and keep friendly relations. \"Don't be afraid of competition, we can compete peacefully.\"",

   "text":"The central bank yesterday extended the banking hours by half an hour after clients rushed up to branches to withdraw cash as the country is set to go into a strict lockdown from April 14 to tame the raging coronavirus.    Clients can carry out transactions between 10:00 am and 1:00 pm on April 12 and April 13, according to a central bank notice. The Bangladesh Bank had shortened the banking hours from 10:00 am to 12:30 pm on April 4, after the government announced a lockdown-like restriction, banning transport movement and closing shops for a week from April 5.  But the coronavirus situation has not improved. Instead, the number of infections and deaths is rising alarmingly. This prompted the government to come up with a strict countrywide lockdown from April 14.   Bankers of Sonali Bank, Southeast Bank, and South Bangla Agriculture and Commerce said many clients apprehended that banks might remain closed during the all-out lockdown. Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader and State Minister for Public Administration Farhad Hossain on Friday said that the government was considering a strict lockdown for a week from April 14. This has created the rush at the banks' premises to withdraw money as people feel comfortable keeping cash at hand at the time of crisis. Yesterday's BB notice did not say anything about the banking hours during the strict lockdown period. However, several central bankers have ruled out any closure of banks and suggested people not be worried. The central bank is working to keep available cash at automated teller machines. Customers will also avail of banking services through digital platforms from anywhere and anytime. The central bank has already increased the transaction ceiling under the booming mobile financial service (MFS) during the lockdown. A client can now send Tk 200,000 per month instead of the previous ceiling of Tk 75,000. Besides, people will not count any charge in sending a maximum of Tk 40,000 per month. Clients are allowed to send Tk 10,000 per transaction without any cost. Earlier, an individual was charged Tk 5 to send money to another person.  ",

   "text":"Apple Inc will launch its first online store in India on Sept. 23, the iPhone maker said on Friday, coinciding with the country’s festive season that rakes in some of the biggest sales for retailers every year. The company currently sells its products in India through third-party vendors and e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc-owned Flipkart. India, with more than 1 billion wireless subscribers of which about a third rely on basic handsets, provides huge growth prospects for smartphone makers, as well as cheap labor to manufacture the devices. Apple Inc  assembles some smartphones, including the iPhone 11, at Foxconn and Wistron’s plants in two southern Indian states. Through its online retail platform, Apple plans to offer assistance to customers in English and Hindi, while allowing users to engrave their iPads, Apple Pencil and Airpods in English and also in a handful of Indian languages, including Bengali and Gujarati. Earlier this week, Apple rolled out a virtual fitness service and a bundle of all its subscriptions, Apple One, focusing on services that are the backbone of Apple’s growth strategy and that cater to customers working at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

   "text":"Senior posts in the government of Laos are being given mainly to the children of Party leaders, with seven out of 17 new cabinet members drawn from two famous families alone, in a trend some observers are calling cases of “inherited power,” Lao sources say. The seven, who hold ministry-level positions or top posts in the Supreme Court or National Assembly, are all members of the powerful Siphandone and Phomvihane families, according to a list announced on March 22 by the country’s prime minister, Phankham Viphavanh, who replaces Thongloun Sisoulith—now Party General Secretary—in the post. One member of the Phomvihane family, Santiphab Phomvihane—a son of the late Lao president Kaysone Phomvihane—is now the governor of Savannakhet province, according to Phankham’s list of top Party assignments. “Inheriting power has been a common practice for a long time in Laos. Everybody knows that,” a Lao scholar in Luang Prabang province told RFA in an interview this week. “In order for somebody to climb up the ladder, first and foremost he or she has to have a ‘blood connection,’” he said. “Qualifications are secondary.” “Most children or relatives of prominent Party leaders will inherit their power. This has become a tradition,” said Adison Seumyaem, a Thai expert on Laos at the Institute of Asian Studies in Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University. “In Laos, power inheritance is more visible than it is in Vietnam and China,” he added. China’s so-called “princelings” hold commanding positions in that Communist state, and the club includes President and party chief Xi Jinping. Also speaking to RFA, a Lao government official said however that the members of the new cabinet had risen to their posts based on merit, and not on family connections. “They have been in the Party for a long time, and are very knowledgeable and capable. That’s why most of them are in the cabinet,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Having children of the former revolutionary leaders in the cabinet is good for the development of the country, because they’re well-disciplined and law abiding and are grateful to their parents,” the official added. “Their parents accomplished great things, and now their children will do the same,” he said. “If someone else were appointed minister, he or she might think ‘differently’ or do something different, something that wouldn’t be right,” he added. Many in Laos say they hope the country’s new prime minister and a National Assembly elected in February will make long-needed changes in the governing of the one-party communist state. One businessman in the capital Vientiane told RFA, “[The new prime minister] should do what he said he was going to do—that is, crack down on corruption, drugs, and the illegal trade in logs and wood.” “It’s difficult to crack down on corruption, though,” another Vientiane resident said. “Some officials always ask for kickbacks. Many people complain about this.” “Corruption is still widespread in Laos,” a businesswoman in Pakse city, Champassak province, in southern Laos said. “For example, many state employees at financial departments are all rich and have luxury cars and homes, though their salary is only about 3 million kip [U.S. $300] a month.” “The government should inspect all that,” she said. An employee of the government inspection office in Vientiane meanwhile told RFA that top Party figures in Laos appear to be out of bounds for a closer scrutiny of their wealth. “I have been working in this office for 10 years now, and I have never inspected any top Party or government leaders in the capital. We’ve only inspected low-ranking officials and departments within the administration of the capital,” he said. “In the past, the top leaders declared their assets, but only a small portion, and they hid most of them,” a former Party member agreed. “And the audit agency is not powerful enough to inspect them. So the new government needs to reverse that practice,” he said. Today's elites are the offspring of leaders of the Lao People's Liberation Army, or Pathet Lao, a communist movement organized, equipped, and guided by Vietnam's Communist Party that overthrew the Lao monarchy in 1975.  The Lao People's Revolutionary Party is the only party the landlocked country of 7 million people has ever known. Laos has a history of widespread government corruption, with the Government Inspection Authority (GIA) reporting in early 2020 that the government lost up to $120 million in 2019 to corruption, disciplined 700 state employees, and fired 400 of them. In the previous year, the GIA found 970 were involved in corruption amounting to $107 million. Transparency International reported in January 2021 that Laos’ corruption ranking had worsened, dropping from 130  in 2019 to 134  in 2020 out of 180 countries.",
