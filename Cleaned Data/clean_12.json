The 57-year-old Black woman from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, feared that her high blood pressure and diabetes might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. Then a member of Pringle’s church, a local NAACP leader who has led a vaccination campaign targeting Black residents, urged her to reconsider. He shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. “That’s what made me change my mind,” said Pringle, who finally agreed to an appointment to get her first   shot Thursday. “I had to pray about it. And I felt better after that.” Campaigns aimed at Black communities across the US are making headway in the effort to persuade people that the   vaccines are safe and effective. With millions of dollars in assistance from President Joe Biden’s administration, local groups have urged Black Americans to roll up their sleeves for shots and set aside what for some is a shared historical distrust of science and government. A poll by   for Public Affairs Research in late March found that about 24 percent of Black American adults said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. That’s down from 41 percent in January. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots in almost the same proportion as white Americans at 26 percent and Hispanic Americans at 22 percent. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken “almost a 180-degree turnaround” as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. He credited Black physicians, faith leaders and other community organisers for being trusted messengers during the pandemic, which has killed more than 5,50,000 Americans. “It’s the messenger and the message,” but the messenger “is probably the most important part of it, and people doing it in a way that wasn’t preachy,” Benjamin said. “They didn’t tell people, ‘You need to get vaccinated because it’s your duty.’ They basically said, ‘Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family.’” Some of the most effective outreach has relied on existing community relationships, such as local physicians talking about their own decisions to get vaccinated, to reassure the public, said Dr Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. Community members in the Baltimore area who knew Cooper from her research on food deserts and nutrition trusted her as a source of information on   , she said. Based on that relationship, “people felt comfortable hearing from me,” she said. Some state health departments have rolled out ads targeting communities of color. NAACP chapters in some cities have booked appointments for people to get shots. Pastors of Black churches have urged their parishioners to take the vaccines. In Brunswick, Georgia, the Rev John Perry and another Black pastor put their faces on a billboard promoting the vaccines, and postcards with a similar image were mailed to residents. Both efforts were produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. “I think we still have enough people on the fence that are going to budge and get their shots,” said Perry, who initially wanted to wait a year before getting his shots but changed his mind after reading up on how the vaccines were developed. He got his second dose Wednesday. Jason Pettibone, a Black barber in Perry’s coastal Georgia community, remains hesitant. His parents and sister have all been vaccinated with no ill effects. Yet Pettibone said the stories he hears from customers — including one who swore his father lost all feeling in the right side of his body after getting a shot — have made it hard to overcome his uncertainty. “I’m thinking in my head not only would it be good for me to get it, because I don’t want to get sick myself, but also to protect other people who come into the shop,” Pettibone said. “But it’s the unknown. Everybody’s really scared of the unknown.” In Savannah, Georgia, community activist Natavia Sanders said outreach efforts can backfire with some in the Black community who suspect the government is targeting them as test subjects rather than seeking to protect their health. Some of that skepticism can be traced to an infamous study in Tuskegee, Alabama, where the government let hundreds of Black men suffer untreated syphilis for 40 years for research purposes. Sanders declined to say whether she was getting vaccinated. She said she’s spoken with several people who had to be hospitalised with   but still have doubts about the vaccines. “That’s how skeptical people are,” Sanders said. “They’re like, ‘No, I’ll fight it myself. I fought it already.’” PM Browner got her vaccine Wednesday in Clarksdale, Mississippi. The 88-year-old Black woman said she doesn’t understand why she needs to get vaccinated if she’s not sick or around sick people. Still, she agreed to get her shot. She said she thinks vaccinations will eventually be required, and she wants to be able to continue to socialise at a local senior center. “If you ain’t got nothing, why do we need to take it?” Browner said. “But we’ll take it because later on, they’ll say, ‘You’ve got to take it.’ If you don’t, later on, I think we’ll have to.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" alt=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pfizer-vaccine-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162553", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "44667", "source": "scrapy"},

Diwali, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Eid, Christmas, and Kumbh Mela, the mother of all festivals, are clearly not enough. We probably have the most literary festivals in the world. Other countries have run-of-the-mill elections. India,   and   has a “festival of democracy” Therefore it’s hardly surprising that in the middle of the second wave of   , the prime minister wants the good citizens of India to have themselves a   or a vaccination festival. In his speech, Narendra Modi suggested that a   between 11 and 14 April could boost the vaccination drive. Also, 11 April happens to be the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotiba Phule while 14 April is that of Babasaheb Ambedkar. This could be some strategist’s brainwave of killing two birds with one jab. One year ago as India went into lockdown the prime minister had other festive ideas to raise our spirits - we clanged pots and pans, blew conch shells, lit divas. There were even WhatsApp forwards about how that vibration was going to destroy the virus. One year later the virus is rampaging through the country in its second wave, those WhatsApp forwarders have move on to other causes and we have upped the game from pots and pans and candles to a full-fledged festival. Cynics might roll their eyes but the prime minister knows that as soon as it’s called a festival it becomes a red-letter day in our minds. Amazon and Flipkart can do “Tika Utsav” bumper sales starting on 12:01 am on 11 April until 11:59 pm on 14 April. Pizza Hut can deliver Tika Utsav special pizzas - with tika kebab toppings of course. Each city can have friendly contests to see which centre doles out the most shots in one day, that’s vaccine shots, not alcoholic ones. Anything that encourages vaccination is of course something to be encouraged. And the prime minister is in his own way a cheerleader-in-chief for the nation. Thus he is to be commended for trying to encourage all eligible Indians to go out and get vaccinated. And if some upbeat festival messaging works better than doom-and-gloom portents so be it. Of course, there is a danger that in the rush to celebrate tika utsavs, we could crowd vaccination centres and forget about social distancing but that’s a minor quibble. But what feels incongruous is this cheery PSA for a “festival of vaccination” occurs at the same time as a “festival of democracy” is unfolding in so many states across India. The pandemic and the election seem to be occurring in different worlds, hermetically sealed from each other. There are two Indias, one in which a   second wave is raging and one in which elections are happening and apparently never the twain shall meet. Mind you this is a country where a court rules that you can be fined for not wearing your mask while alone in your car. A vehicle is a “public place” says the Delhi High Court but a political rally is obviously not. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan recently scolded his fellow citizens for letting down their guard and allowing the Covid numbers to explode afresh. He blamed “lack of commitment and sincerity” and said, “nobody is interested in wearing the mask.. there’s no respect for the norms of physical distancing.” , the same minister shared pictures of his party leaders holding election rallies where hardly anyone was wearing a mask and there was certainly no physical distancing happening. “One look at Harsh Vardhan’s Twitter feed makes it quite clear who could be called out “for taking everything casually’” writes Rohan Venkataramakrishnan in  . It’s not a BJP problem. It’s a problem pretty much across the political spectrum. Old habits die hard. Old electioneering habits die especially hard. Photographs from rallies across Bengal for example, whether Trinamool or BJP or the Left Front-Congress combine, would hardly suggest the country is grappling with a pandemic. It looks just like something from five years ago. Perhaps the fact that the Bihar elections did not cause a huge explosion in infections lulled us into a false sense of complacency. But these elections are happening in the middle of a certified second wave. Yet the same politicians who wag their fingers at the public for giving safety precautions a “tilanjali” seem to have no interest in leading by example. And they do not even see the jarring dissonance. It is obviously not easy in a country like India to do physical distancing at the best of times, let alone at election time. But we can do our bit. The symbolism matters. Though Donald Trump sneered at Joe Biden for wearing a mask during his campaign, Biden resolutely stuck to it. The open-air inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris with the guests wearing masks sent out two messages - one, that the business of democracy and transition of power must go one and two, they must go on with as much safety precautions as possible in these grave times. It was about fortitude in face of a pandemic not the denial of it. It will never be foolproof but the message is important. The visual of masked politicians on stage at an election rally in India would send out a message as well. A top political leader taking his mask off to address the rally and then putting it back on would send out a message. Similarly, a crowded stage filled with maskless jostling politicians sends out its own message to the rank and file. A political candidate in Kolkata told reporters asking him about lack of masks and safety norms that he was “not afraid” of the virus and he would win, Covid or no Covid. Tirath Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand tells devotees planning to attend Mahakumbh that “nobody will be stopped in the name of   ” because “faith is stronger than fear”. Two days later he tested positive. At this point it’s baffling that politicians still think bravado is the vaccine we all need. Now the Haridwar district magistrate has said all schools in the district will remain closed from 9 to 15 April not because of   fears but “in view of a huge rush of devotees to Kumbh Mela.”    It’s clear that after a year everyone is suffering from Covid safety exhaustion. The masks are slipping and weddings and parties are back and public transport is crowded. We read about rising numbers and lack of beds but there’s no indication that it’s affecting our behaviour. A video of a cheerful woman at a temple during Holi telling a reporter there was no Covid there recently went viral. Despite Yogi Adityanath’s strongman reputation in Uttar Pradesh, his exhortation to maintain safety protocols during Holi seemed to fall on many deaf ears. People are tired of a year of safety protocols or lulled by the dip in numbers at the end of 2020 or both. But now that the second wave has truly landed, mixed messages from the political leaders do not help. While the PM exhorts us to not let down our guard, we just hear \"no lockdown\". The prime minister in his message about the second wave has reiterated the focus needs to be on “test, track, treat, Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid management”. That’s commendable. But perhaps the time has come for politicians of all parties, not just the aam aadmi, to also exhibit that “Covid-appropriate behaviour”. And if we must turn everything into a festival, what about a month-long “mask festival” instead of just a tika one?", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" alt=\"Tika utsav is fine but poll rallies with zero social distancing, no masks big threat to India's war on COVID-19\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tamil-nadu-election_BJP_PTI_640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162554", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "45153", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.deccanchronicle.com", "section": "Top Stories", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/110421/polavaram-will-render-people-from-192-villages-homeless.html", "title": "Polavaram will render people from 192 villages homeless", "author": "\n\t\t\tDECCAN CHRONICLE.", "author_link": "", "published_date": "Apr 11, 2021, 11:58 pm IST", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Fearing submergence, locals demand compensation, safer living places", "text": ": All those who have been displaced from 192 villages because of Polavaram Project are living in fear amid insecurity.

Five people died on Friday, and another six the next day, after police shot at demonstrators in several major districts across the Muslim-majority nation of 168 million people.   The protesters -- mostly from the hardline Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam -- were angry at the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as Bangladesh marked 50 years of independence, accusing him of stoking communal violence against Muslims in his country. At one new protest in Narayanganj just outside the capital Dhaka, Hefazat supporters chanted \"action, action, direct action\" as they blocked the key highway linking Dhaka with the port city of Chittagong. Hundreds of demonstrators burnt furniture and tyres on the roads as they chanted anti-Modi slogans and called on authorities to investigate the shootings. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets after the protesters barricaded parts of the highway. A police spokesman told AFP they had since left the road.   Prothom Alo, the country's biggest Bengali-language daily, said at least 15 people were injured in the Narayanganj clashes. Hefazat spokesman Jakaria Noman Foyezi told AFP thousands of its supporters joined demonstrations at its headquarters at Hathazari outside Chittagong, which is home to a top Islamic seminary. The Islamist group has a nationwide network, and it has held large protests in the past demanding that Bangladesh introduce blasphemy laws. Protests were also held in the northeastern city of Sylhet, the eastern district of Brahmanbaria and in Bosila, a Dhaka suburb, but there were no reports of violence, local media reported.   As Bangladesh celebrated independence, human rights groups criticised the government for what they described as growing authoritarianism, including forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Other groups -- including students, leftists and other Islamist outfits -- had also staged protests against Modi's visit on Friday and Saturday.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162553", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16884", "source": "scrapy"},

Under-60s can still decide to take the vaccine but only following \"consultation with the doctor carrying out the vaccination ... and with an individual risk analysis,\" said ministers of Germany's 16 states as well as the federal health minister in a policy statement.   The World Health Organization and the EU's health watchdog have both deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine safe, but several countries have restricted its use over clotting fears. Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that experts have recorded in recent weeks \"very rare but very serious cases of thrombosis\" in people vaccinated with AstraZeneca. \"They are findings that (Germany's vaccine commission) and finally us, cannot ignore,\" she said. Germany's vaccine commission known as STIKO earlier Tuesday recommended that use of the jabs be halted for under-60s because of \"currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects\" in younger vaccinated people.   It intends to make another recommendation by the end of April on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received a first dose of the vaccine, it said. Pending this decision, ministers said people who are due for their second jab can either choose to take it if cleared by their attending doctor, or they can opt to wait for the commission to make its recommendation. The latest restrictions amounted to a new setback for the vaccine developed by the Anglo-Swedish laboratory. Nevertheless Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany would be able to meet its goal of offering every adult a coronavirus jab by the end of the summer.   Just after it received approval from European regulator EMA for use in the bloc, Germany restricted the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s because of insufficient data. After clearing it for older people subsequently, Germany along with several EU nations suspended its use again in mid-March because of clotting fears. Just over a week after allowing its use again, German authorities have now again halted its use among younger people. Merkel insisted however that it is such careful consideration and transparency that can keep the public's confidence in the vaccine. \"Trust stems from the knowledge that every suspicion, every individual case will be examined,\" she said.   The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people. Germany's medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday. Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week. On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s \"pending further analysis\". The AstraZeneca vaccine has had something of a rollercoaster ride.   Britain, which developed it, staunchly supports its use, South Africa has rejected it outright. France has limited its use to over-55s, while Spain has done the same for under-65s. Germany's vaccination campaign has been sluggish, with official figures showing around 11 percent of the population have received a first dose so far.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162553", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17434", "source": "scrapy"},

Bilateral ties have been strained since the Pyongyang-linked murder of the estranged half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 four years ago. “The Government of Malaysia is now compelled by the decision of the DPRK to close the Embassy of Malaysia in Pyongyang, which operation had already been suspended since 2017,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Friday. “At the same time, the government will issue an order for all the diplomatic staff and their dependents at the Embassy of the DPRK in Kuala Lumpur to leave Malaysia within 48 hours from today, 19 March 2021,” it said. In a statement carried Friday by state news agency KCNA, nuclear-armed North Korea announced “total severance” of diplomatic relations, citing the unpublicized extradition this week of North Korean citizen Mun Chol Myong to the United States. Mun, the first North Korean ever extradited to the United States to face a criminal trial, claimed he was the victim of a “politically motivated” extradition request aimed at pressuring North Korea over its missile program. Malaysia’s Federal Court earlier this month dismissed Mun’s final appeal against the extradition to face four counts of money laundering charges and two counts of conspiracy to launder money. North Korea said in the statement that Malaysia’s extradition of Mun – on March 17 as confirmed by Malaysia’s Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein’s office Friday – was “a super-large hostile act against the DPRK in subservience to U.S. pressure.” The extradition came as North Korea this week rebuffed U.S. moves to resume talks aimed at ending the hardline communist state’s nuclear weapons drive. “We warn in advance that the U.S. – the backstage manipulator and main culprit of this incident – that it will also be made to pay a due price,” it added. Mun, a man in his 50s who had lived in Malaysia since 2008, was arrested in May 2019 after the U.S. accused him of supplying prohibited luxury goods from Singapore to North Korea, in violation of United Nations sanctions. He allegedly laundered funds through front companies, and issued fraudulent documents to support illicit shipments to North Korea, while he was working in Singapore, prior to moving to Malaysia in 2008. But Pyongyang claimed in its statement that Mun had been engaged in legitimate external trade activities in Singapore for many years. “Therefore, it is an absurd fabrication to argue that he was involved in money laundering.” Pyongyang accused the Malaysian judicial system of failing to furnish any proof of Mun’s offense, despite repeated requests by the North Korean embassy and Mun’s lawyer to that effect. The statement further claimed, without providing any evidence, that Malaysian legal officials were paid off by U.S. officials to secure the extradition, and that Putrajaya was promised free military weapons and equipment by the United States. Contacted by BenarNews, Mun’s lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, said that he did not know about his client’s extradition. He said the North Korean embassy should have been informed about it. The Malaysian Foreign Ministry said it “deeply regretted” North Korea’s decision to sever 48 years of diplomatic ties. “Malaysia denounces the decision as unfriendly and unconstructive, disrespecting the spirit of mutual respect and good neighborly relations among members of the international community.” It has given the North Korean embassy staff and their kin in Kuala Lumpur 48 hours to pack their bags and leave the country. Malaysia suspended operation of its embassy in Pyongyang in 2017 after it secured the safe return of nine citizens held in Pyongyang in exchange for the release of Kim Jong Nam’s body. Malaysia’s once-close ties hit rock bottom after Kim Jong Nam was killed with a banned nerve agent at one of Kuala Lumpur’s international airports in February 2017. “Malaysia had always considered the DPRK as a close partner since the establishment of the diplomatic relations in 1973,” said the statement, adding that Malaysia had continued to support the DPRK even during difficult times, including after the “deplorable” assassination of Jong Nam in 2017. Therefore, Pyongyang’s decision is unwarranted, disproportionate, and certainly disruptive toward the promotion of peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, the statement added. It said Mun’s conviction and extradition were based on the principles of justice and rule of law, adding that the Malaysian government has rejected a series of diplomatic notes from North Korea for the government to intervene in the country’s judiciary and legal system. “The extradition was only carried out after the due legal process had been exhausted [and] the rights of Mun Chol Myong while in Malaysian custody were also guaranteed and fulfilled, including his access to his own defense counsel, as well as to consular assistance and visits by his family.”  ", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162553", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12875", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162558", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54751", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asian-times.com", "section": "Entertainment", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asian-times.com/beatitude-the-luxury-destination-for-handcrafted-sarees/", "title": "Beatitude: The Luxury Destination For HandCrafted Sarees", "author": "Nishit Sangwan ", "author_link": "https://www.asian-times.com/author/nishitsangwan/", "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Started just a little over five years, Beatitude has made its mark in the world of exclusive sarees.

Malaysia then ordered the diplomats out in 48 hours, and accused North Korea of attempting to meddle in its judicial system, where Mun Chol Myong lost a battle to halt his extradition following his arrest in May 2019. “The action by the Government of Malaysia has become a necessity in order to protect Malaysia’s sovereignty and safeguard our national interest,” Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in a statement on Sunday regarding the expulsion of the diplomats. “This action is a reminder that Malaysia shall never tolerate any attempt to meddle in our internal affairs and judiciary, disrespect our governance system, and constantly create unnecessary tensions in defiance of the rules-based international order,” he said. Bilateral ties have been strained since the Pyongyang-linked murder of the estranged half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un at a Kuala Lumpur airport four years ago Thirty-three North Koreans including children left the embassy at Jalan Batai in Kuala Lumpur at 11 a.m. on Sunday. A Malaysian police official confirmed the number. North Korean Charge d'affaires Kim Yu Song addressed the press before leaving the compound, reading out part of a statement issued by Pyongyang two days earlier, but declined to take questions. “[T]he Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK hereby announces total severance of diplomatic relations with Malaysia, which committed a large hostile act against the DPRK in subservience of the U.S. pressure,” he said, using an acronym for North Korea’s formal name. “The Malaysian authority will bear full responsibility for all consequences to be incurred between the two countries,” Kim said. At the airport, the group checked in at Shanghai Airlines, and Kim confirmed to BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, that they would be flying to Shanghai. The flight left Malaysia at 4.55 p.m., according to flightradar24, a flight tracker. Kim did not elaborate on their subsequent travel arrangements. North Korea has effectively locked down its borders and airspace as part of the regime’s effort to keep COVID-19 at bay. CNN in a report on Feb. 26 said that the restrictions also cover North Korea’s own Air Koryo, whose flights have been grounded “for months.” Malaysia’s Federal Court earlier this month dismissed Mun’s final appeal against the extradition to face four counts of money laundering charges and two counts of conspiracy to launder money. Hishammuddin’s office confirmed Friday that Mun had been extradited on March 17. The extradition came as North Korea rebuffed U.S. moves to resume talks aimed at ending the hardline communist state’s nuclear weapons drive. “We warn in advance that the U.S. – the backstage manipulator and main culprit of this incident – that it will also be made to pay a due price,” said a statement carried Friday by North Korean state news agency KCNA. Through his lawyer, Mun had argued in court that he was the victim of a “politically motivated” extradition request aimed at pressuring North Korea over its missile program. A man in his 50s who had lived in Malaysia since 2008, Mun was arrested in May 2019 after the U.S. accused him of supplying prohibited luxury goods to North Korea, in violation of United Nations sanctions. He allegedly laundered funds through front companies and issued fraudulent documents to support illicit shipments to North Korea, while working in Singapore, prior to moving to Malaysia. But Pyongyang claimed that Mun had been engaged in legitimate external trade activities in Singapore for many years. Hoo Chiew Ping, an expert on Korean peninsula political affairs, said that Malaysia was now the only country in Southeast Asia without diplomatic ties with both North Korea and South Korea. “All ASEAN members have relations with both Koreas. Now Malaysia is the only one that doesn't have equal and balanced diplomatic relations between the two, because it just lost North Korea. “Malaysia loses its leverage as a key player on Korean Peninsula agenda at the ASEAN level,” Hoo told Benar News, using an acronym for the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Asked about North Korea’s characterization of Malaysia as subservient to the United States, she said that under the Trump administration, Malaysia and other small countries around the world were subjected to Washington’s “maximum pressure” campaign on North Korea. “For Malaysia, this was more so after the Kim Jong Nam assassination. Our handling of the case was under heavy criticism,” she said. Malaysia’s once-close ties with Pyongyang hit rock bottom after the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was killed with a banned nerve agent at one of Kuala Lumpur’s international airports in February 2017. Malaysia suspended operation of its embassy in Pyongyang after it secured the safe return of nine citizens held there, in exchange for the release of Kim Jong Nam’s body. The embassy has been vacant since then. “Malaysia had always considered the DPRK as a close partner since the establishment of the diplomatic relations in 1973,” a Malaysian foreign ministry statement said Friday, adding that Putrajaya had maintained ties with Pyongyang even after the “deplorable” assassination of Kim Jong Nam.

Mun’s conviction and extradition were based on the principles of justice and rule of law, the Malaysian statement said, adding that the government had rejected a series of diplomatic notes from North Korea attempting to intervene in its judiciary and legal system.

She was 59. After fighting Covid-19, she had tested negative for it five days ago. However, her condition worsened and she was taken to hospital again. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Abdul Hamid expressed grief and sent heartfelt condolences to Mita Huq's family. \"We will remember her role in popularising Rabindra Sangeet among the masses\", said the President in his message. She was taken to Chhayanaut Sangeet Bidyayatan at 11:00am yesterday for her colleagues and well-wishers to pay their last respects. She was buried next to her father at Keraniganj's Boromonoharia. \"I am shocked,\" said eminent Rabindra Sangeet exponent, Rezwana Chowdhury Bannya. \"This is an irrevocable loss for Rabindra Sangeet. We always kept in touch and her premature demise really hurts me. May she rest in peace.\" Sadi Mohammad, one of the most revered Rabindra Sangeet artistes in the country, said that he saw Mita as his younger sister. \"I have done so many shows with her both at home and abroad… She would visit me whenever she felt better and would be really happy whenever we visited her. I would often cook and take food for her. My heart is filled with sorrow now.\" Renowned Nazrul Sangeet artiste Sujit Mustafa also shared his grief. \"She was a rare talent -- a top tier artiste. There are many singers who can sing commercially today but very few have the calibre of Mita Huq. She wanted to get well and return to music. Unfortunately, this will not happen anymore.\" \"I am at a loss,\" said National Award winning singer-composer Bappa Mazumder. \"It is difficult to accept that Mita di left us.\" Famed classical exponent and guru Asit Dey considers Mita Huq to be an example for the next generation to follow. \"She was an artiste's artiste -- a role model. I have never seen her without a smile on her face. She used to come to our classical music ashor and would listen to music all night, such was her love towards music.\" Noted actor Runa Khan said, \"I lost someone so dear to me. This void is never to be filled. I just pray that she found peace in her passing.\" Her passing is indeed a huge loss to Rabindra Sangeet. The artiste, who had carved her own niche in the art, was unique in her presentation. In both West Bengal and Bangladesh, she was seen as a pioneer with a inimitable style, never likening herself to anyone else's pattern. Born into a musical family, the noted artiste received her training from maestros such as the late Wahidul Huq, Sanjida Khatun and Ustad Mohammad Hossain Khan. She was a regular performer in the Bangladesh TV and radio since 1977. She participated in the Berlin International Youth Festival in 1974, and since then, travelled all over the world for performances. The singer rose to prominence in the 90's with her first album \"Amar Mon Mane Na\". With her mellifluous voice, she won over the hearts of all Bangladeshi listeners. She voiced over 200 albums throughout her illustrious career. Mita Huq was also the founder director and teacher of the Music Training and Performance Group -- Surtirtha -- and served as the head of the department of Rabindra Sangeet at Chhayanaut Institute in Dhaka. She was also the former general secretary and incumbent vice-president of the Rabindra Sangeet Shommelon Parishad. In 2017, she and writer Hayat Mamud received the Rabindra Puraskar from Bangla Academy. The legendary artiste was awarded the coveted Ekushey Padak in 2020 for her contributions to music. She was outspoken about the divisiveness, moral corruption and violence in a world where Tagore had spoken of unconditional peace and urged everyone to be kinder to one another. For the last five years,  Mita Huq had been battling various kidney-related diseases and underwent dialysis. The singer was married to actor-director Khaled Khan, who passed away in December 2013. Farhin Khan Joyita, a renowned singer, is their only daughter.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-6\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/2021/04/12/mita-hoq.jpg?itok=VVLFzJDX&amp;c=29223f11a4d920b900224e2d6bfdfc69\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162559", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "18185", "source": "scrapy"},

Mun is accused of laundering money through the U.S. financial system as part of a scheme to provide luxury items to the DPRK,” it said, using North Korea’s official name, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “The indictment alleges that Mun defrauded banks and laundered money in an effort to evade counter-proliferation sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United States and the United Nations,” said Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice Department’s National Security Division in a statement. Malaysia’s decision to extradite Mun nearly two years after his arrest in May 2019 caused an irate Pyongyang to sever decades-old diplomatic ties last week. Malaysia then ordered the North’s diplomats out in 48 hours, and accused North Korea of attempting to meddle in its judicial system, where Mun Chol Myong lost a battle to halt his extradition. Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in a statement Sunday that the expulsion of the diplomats was a “reminder that Malaysia shall never tolerate any attempt to meddle in our internal affairs and judiciary, disrespect our governance system, and constantly create unnecessary tensions in defiance of the rules-based international order.” Bilateral ties have been strained since the Pyongyang-linked murder of the estranged half-brother of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un at a Kuala Lumpur airport four years ago.  “[T]he Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK hereby announces total severance of diplomatic relations with Malaysia, which committed a large hostile act against the DPRK in subservience of the U.S. pressure,” said North Korean Charge d'affaires Kim Yu Song on Sunday, reading a statement from Friday. “The Malaysian authority will bear full responsibility for all consequences to be incurred between the two countries,” Kim said. Malaysia’s Federal Court earlier this month dismissed Mun’s final appeal against the extradition to face four counts of money laundering charges and two counts of conspiracy to launder money. Through his lawyer, Mun had argued in court that he was the victim of a “politically motivated” extradition request aimed at pressuring North Korea over its missile program. Mun, who had lived in Malaysia since 2008, was arrested in May 2019 after the U.S. accused him of supplying prohibited luxury goods to North Korea, in violation of United Nations sanctions, imposed to curb the regime's access to hard currency to fund its nuclear and missile programs. He allegedly laundered funds through front companies and issued fraudulent documents to support illicit shipments to North Korea, while working in Singapore, prior to moving to Malaysia. But Pyongyang claimed that Mun had been engaged in legitimate external trade activities in Singapore for many years. \"Mun and his conspirators went to great lengths to avoid detection of their sanctions-busting operation. They used a web of front companies and bank accounts registered to false names and removed references to the DPRK from international wire transfer and transactional documents,\" said the DOJ statement, citing the indictment. \"By intentionally concealing that their transactions were for the benefit of DPRK entities, Mun and his conspirators deceived U.S. correspondent banks into processing U.S. dollar transactions for the benefit of DPRK entities, which the correspondent banks would have otherwise not processed,\" said the DOJ. David Maxwell of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Mun’s extradition “is very, very important because it is the first case, and this North Korean is, of course, part of Kim Jong Un's illicit activities network. He's laundering money for the regime, and so it's a significant, significant event.” “They probably fear that this gentleman will provide information about how North Korea's illicit activities network works,” he added. “They are shutting down activities in Malaysia to protect the rest of their global network, so it really is a significant event.” North Korea reacted angrily to Mun’s case “because it does give the U.S. a tool if it's able to extradite people to the United States. It takes them off of the playing field,” said Ken Gause, research program director at the Virginia-based CNA think tank “It's people that the North Koreans normally would be able to get out of a situation in a particular country especially like Malaysia which North Korea has very close relationships with,” he told RFA. “That's going to potentially give the United States a weapon for gathering information about North Korea and what the North Koreans are up to,” added Gause. In a comment published by the DOJ, Alan E. Kohler Jr., assistant director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division, said “One of the FBI’s biggest counterintelligence challenges is bringing overseas defendants to justice, especially in the case of North Korea.” “Thanks to the FBI’s partnership with foreign authorities, we’re proud to bring Mun Chol Myong to the United States to face justice, and we hope he will be the first of many,” he said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162558", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13237", "source": "scrapy"},

Pyongyang on Friday severed ties with Malaysia and closed down its embassy in Kuala Lumpur after the extradition of businessman Mun Chol Myong to Washington, where he faces six counts of money laundering. Malaysia then ordered the North’s diplomats out in 48 hours and accused Pyongyang of attempting to meddle in its judicial system, where Mun lost a two-year battle to halt his extradition. “As soon as I heard the reports that the Malaysian authorities arrested and handed over a North Korean businessman… to the U.S., the first thing that worried me was the safety of the embassy officials stationed there,” a North Korean trade official in Beijing, China told RFA’s Korean Service Monday. “No matter where it happens, if any incident like this occurs, the embassy officials stationed in that area will have to take responsibility,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. The source said the case was particularly unusual because Mun was now in the custody of the U.S., which the source referred to as the “enemy country.” The source believed Mun may be an important fundraiser for North Korea’s ruling Korean Workers’ Party. He did not provide any basis for his claim. “This incident has a political character in that it has undermined the authority of the   externally. As soon as it happened, the leadership in Pyongyang cut diplomatic relations with Malaysia,” the source said, using an honorific term to refer to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “The embassy staff were notified to leave Malaysia within 48 hours. They were immediately on their way home as if they were chased away,” said the source. The North Korean trade officials in China say they are worried about what could happen to the embassy’s most senior officials, such as Chargé D’affaires Kim Yu Song, according to the source. “There is high concern that they may be dismissed or even be sent to a political prison camp for undermining the authority of the Highest Dignity and the country,” the source said. “The U.S. is known to quickly identify and monitor the flow of illegal funds worldwide. In China, North Korean workers are making foreign currency and dealing with large amounts of money,” said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “In many cases, they violate the economic sanctions levied by the U.N. and U.S., so many are anxious that they could also be taken by the U.S. someday,” said the second source. The second source said the workers stationed abroad feel they are in an unfair situation—ordered by North Korean authorities to do illegal things to earn foreign currency. “But if any of them are deported for violating international sanctions, the authorities in North Korea will hold them personally responsible and punish them.” North Korea and Malaysia established diplomatic relations in 1973, and with a visa waiver agreement in place, Malaysia became a major destination for Pyongyang to send trade workers to earn foreign currency over the years.

Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162558", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16252", "source": "scrapy"},

In today’s post-COVID-19 world, the visitor figures are about 60 per cent of monthly capacity. Some things have not changed, however; for instance, a number of people think it is acceptable not to shower before entering the pool, the programme   finds out in a series of vox pops. Others may even pee in the pool, thinking that chlorine is used to disinfect the water. The problem, however, is that urine and sweat contain ammonia, which reduces the effect that chlorine has on the water. So what is being done to keep the pools sufficiently clean to protect swimmers from bacteria and viruses, which can enter the water? And what is the principal reason why one should shower before swimming? Marchwood Laboratory Services technical manager Tan Thuan Piang, who has sampled Singapore’s pool waters with his team for over 15 years, noted that ammonia in pools, though mainly from sweat and urine, also comes from sunscreen lotion and cosmetics. While the amount of ammonia in Singapore’s pools is usually “minute” — low enough to escape detection — a possible reason for this is that ammonia “reacts very fast” with chlorine in the water to form the by-product chloramine, he said. When there is a “heavy chlorine smell”, it is usually tri-chloramine, a type of chloramine formed as the ammonia level rises and “not the chlorine we really want”, cited Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder. “It’s a nuisance,” said the professor, who has studied water quality and safety for more than 20 years. “As the chlorine forms chloramine, there’s less chlorine there. So we have to … add more chlorine to keep the level safe. “If we don’t practise good hygiene, the amount of chlorine in a swimming pool will drop quickly and make it less safe … The more hygiene we have, the less ammonia there’ll be and the cleaner the pools stay.” This is why he “always” advocates showering before entering the pool — to minimise the amount of chemicals it needs. Chloramine can also have a more direct effect on swimmers. National Skin Centre consultant dermatologist Lucinda Tan, who handles two to three patients a month for swimming-related conditions, said chloramines can “irritate and dry the skin” by stripping away the skin’s natural protective oil. “This allows dust, bacteria (and) allergens to enter and cause irritation. A normal person with normal skin … may get away with that,” she said. “You break a lot of the skin barrier, and you allow a lot of germs to enter, and then you can get bad infections,\" she added. “If your immune system is compromised … and (you have) a small cut and whatnot, you can still pick up an infection that can potentially worsen with time.” She noted that all exposed parts of the body, including the hair and eyes, can be affected. People may also end up with a dry and itchy throat if they swallow “a little bit more” pool water. And some children may be more susceptible to dry, irritating skin than adults. To maintain safety, there are national standards for the chlorine level in Singapore’s swimming pools: It must be between one to three parts per million. “Too little chlorine (and) it’d encourage algae to form. Too much chlorine (and) you’d feel the itch and discomfort on (your) skin,” said Jonas Su, operations director of pool maintenance company Anwill. Normally, at the end of a servicing, his team adds chlorine even if the pool passes muster, as the reading would drop. “By adding a little bit more, probably it’ll shoot up … still within the ideal range,” he said. “It’ll last for a few days before we come again.” Other parameters for testing pool cleanliness include the pH value, colour and turbidity (cloudiness) of the water. By regulation, the pH value — which shows the level of acidity or alkalinity — should be between 7.2 and 7.8. But when Talking Point submitted samples from 10 public pools — in Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bishan, Clementi, Jalan Besar, Jurong East, Kallang Basin, Queenstown, Tampines and Yishun — to Marchwood for testing, half of them were not within this range. “It’s not a concern,” said Marchwood’s Tan, who described the readings of 8.1 to 8.3 as “slightly higher”. “But any pH that’s above nine will cause some skin irritation.” Marchwood also tested the samples for faecal bacteria, namely E. coli and the coliform count. By the National Environment Agency’s standards, there should not be more than 200 bacteria per millilitre of water. And all the samples met this standard as well as the other test parameters. Besides adding chlorine to pools, the cleaning process includes scooping up debris and vacuuming the bottom of the pools. This can be a laborious task. What swimmers can do for personal hygiene on their part is relatively simple, however, like having a quick rinse before entering the pool to get rid of dirt, as well as applying moisturiser and sunblock if needed. Although moisturisers would contribute to the formation of chloramine, Tan the dermatologist said their use would help buffer the effects of chlorine or chloramine on skin. There are “two broad groups” of moisturisers: One has the “building blocks” of skin to repair the skin; the other acts as a protective barrier. “So it depends on a patient’s preference and the skin conditions,” she said. “Generally, you’d want something slightly oilier because you want the moisturiser to last for the duration of the swim … The ones that are more water-resistant would help as well.\" She also recommended having a rinse immediately after leaving the pool to “get rid of all the chlorine”. She added: “If possible, use a gentle cleanser (for) a more complete removal.” For extra assurance, swimmers can even get a test strip online that shows the pH and chlorine levels of the water on the spot.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162559", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47538", "source": "scrapy"},

One salvage expert said freeing the cargo ship, the Ever Given, could take up to a week in the best-case scenario and warned of possible structural problems on the vessel as it remains wedged.   The Ever Given, owned by the Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK, got wedged Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. A team from Boskalis, a Dutch firm specializing in salvaging, is working with the canal authority. using tugboats and a specialized suction dredger that is trying to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the bow. Egyptian authorities have prohibited media access to the site. An attempt Friday to free it failed, said Bernhard Schulte Ship management, the technical manager of the Ever Given. Plans are in the works to pump water from interior spaces of the vessel, and two more tugs should arrive by Sunday, the company said.   The Suez Canal Authority said it welcomed international offers of help. A U.S. defense official said Washington has offered Egypt assistance, including possible naval aid, and they are in discussions about how best to help. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss aid that has not yet been finalized. The canal authority released a video showing Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei inspecting efforts to free the Ever Given and telling workers: “Good luck, God willing.” An initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause, the company said. GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, had previously said the ship had experienced a power blackout, but it did not elaborate.   Bernhard Schulte said two canal pilots had been aboard the ship when it got stuck. Such an arrangement is customary, but the ship’s captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel, according to shipping experts. In addition to the over 200 vessels waiting near the canal, more than 100 ships were en route to the waterway, according to the data firm Refinitiv. Apparently anticipating long delays, the owners of the stuck vessel diverted a sister ship, the Ever Greet, to head around Africa instead, according to satellite data. Others also are being diverted to avoid the canal. The liquid natural gas carrier Pan Americas changed course in the mid-Atlantic, now aiming south to go around the southern tip of Africa, according to satellite data from MarineTraffic.com.   About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil. The closure also could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Oil markets are absorbing the disruption for now, said analyst Toril Bosoni. “Oil inventories have been coming down but they are still relatively ample,” he told The Associated Press, adding that he believes the impact might be more pronounced in the tanker sector than in the oil industry. “We are not losing any oil supply but it will tie up tankers for longer if they have to go around” the tip of Africa, he said, which is roughly an additional two-week trip.   Freeing the Ever Given is “quite a challenge” and could take five days to a week, .Capt. Nick Sloane, a maritime salvage expert who led the high-profile effort to salvage the cruise ship Costa Concordia in 2012 told the AP. The Ever Given’s location, size and large amount of cargo make the operation more complex, Sloane said. The operation should focus initially on dredging the bank and sea floor around it to get it floating again, rather than unloading its cargo, which could take weeks. That’s because the clock is also ticking structurally for the vessel, he added. “The longer it takes, the worse the condition of the ship will become, because she’s slowly sagging,” said Sloane, vice president of the International Salvage Union. “So ships are designed to flex, but not to be kept at that position with a full load of cargo for weeks at a time. So it’s not an easy situation.”   International companies are preparing for the effect that the canal’s blockage will have on supply chains that rely on precise deliveries of goods. Singapore’s Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung said the country’s port should expect disruptions. “Should that happen, some draw down on inventories will become necessary,” he said on Facebook. The backlog of vessels could stress European ports and the international supply of containers, already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, according to IHS Markit, a business research group. It said 49 container ships were scheduled to pass through the canal in the week since the Ever Given became lodged.   The delay could also result in huge insurance claims by companies, according to Marcus Baker, global head of Marine & Cargo at the insurance broker Marsh, with a ship like the Ever Given usually covered at between $100 million to $200 million. Those trying to free the vessel want to avoid complications that could extend the canal closure, according to an Egyptian official at the canal authority. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to talk to journalists. Satellite and photos distributed by the canal authority show Ever Given’s bow touching the eastern wall, while its stern appeared lodged against the western wall.   The Ever Given was involved in an accident in northern Germany in 2019, when it ran into a small ferry moored on the Elbe River in Hamburg. No passengers were on the ferry at the time and there were no injuries, but it was seriously damaged. Hamburg prosecutors opened an investigation of the Ever Given’s captain and pilot on suspicion of endangering shipping traffic, but shelved it in 2020 for lack of evidence, spokeswoman Liddy Oechtering told The Associated Press. Oechtering also could not say what the investigation had determined the cause of the crash was, but officials at the time suggested that strong winds may have blown the slow moving cargo ship into the ferry.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162558", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18785", "source": "scrapy"},

PM Modi also revealed that he had participated in a “Satyagraha” in India in 1971 as a youth in support of Bangladesh’s struggle for independence and had even courted arrest and gone to jail. He recalled the atrocities and heinous crimes committed by the Pakistani Army in 1971 on the people of Bangladesh and said photographs of these did not let people sleep for days. The high-profile visit of PM Modi began on a stormy note, with four supporters of hardline Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam being shot dead after violence erupted at Hathazari, a rural town, according to international news agency reports from Dhaka. The four were apparently shot dead during protests being staged by the Islamist group against PM Modi’s visit. Ruhul Amin, the government administrator of Hathazari town, told news agency AFP that upto 1,500 supporters of the hardline group attacked a police station chanting anti-Modi slogans. Other reports said hundreds of protesters also staged protests outside Dhaka’s Baitul Mokarram Mosque to oppose the visit, resulting in clashes and injuries after they attacked the Police.   Meanwhile, in a special gesture, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Ministers from her cabinet welcomed PM Modi at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on his arrival in Dhaka earlier in the day. A salute of 19 guns and Guard of honour were accorded to PM Modi. The Bangladesh PM praised India for its current development partnership and support during the Covid Pandemic and recalled the historic support of India for the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971. She also recalled the horrific assassination nearly 46 years ago of her father and founder of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujib on August 15, 1975, and the killing of several of her family members on that day. Sheikh Hasina was abroad at the time.   Earlier in the day, soon after his arrival in Dhaka, PM Modi visited the National Martyrs’ Memorial (Jatiyo Sriti Shoudho), the National monument of Bangladesh, at Savar, about 35 km north-west of Dhaka  to pay tributes to the valour and the sacrifice of those who gave their lives in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. PM Modi signed the visitor’s book in the monument and wrote, “I pray that the eternal flame at Savar remains a lasting reminder of the noble victory of truth and courage over deceit and oppression.” Bangladesh is celebrating 50 years of its existence this year and both countries are also celebrating 50 years of establishment of diplomatic relations with each other this year. The Indian armed forces’ victory over Pakistan in the war in December, 1971, had led to the liberation of the erstwhile East Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh as an Independent nation. The Pakistani Army’s crackdown began in March, 1971, and officially three million people were killed during the nine-month long war. PM Modi’s “historic visit is to celebrate Mujib Borsho- the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ; 50 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh; and 50 years of Bangladesh’s war of liberation”.   Paying homage to the martyrs of the freedom struggle, PM Modi said, “The photographs showing the atrocities and heinous crimes committed by the Pakistani Army did not let people sleep for days. We will not forget those who secured independence for Bangladesh by sacrificing oceans of blood. We will not forget (their sacrifice). ... Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerged as a ray of hope or the people both here and in India.” PM Modi added, “I must have been 20-22 years of age when I along with several of my colleagues offered a Satyagraha in support of Bangladesh’s struggle for Independence. I courted arrest while supporting the struggle for Bangladesh’s independence and went to jail.” PM Modi also recalled the efforts of the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the Bangladesh liberation war.   PM Modi further said, “I salute the brave soldiers of the Indian Army who stood with the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh in Muktijuddo (liberation war). Those who gave their blood in ‘Muktijuddo’, sacrificed themselves, and played a very big role in realising the dream of independent Bangladesh. This is one of the most memorable days of my life. I am grateful that Bangladesh has included me in this event. I am grateful that Bangladesh has invited India to take part in this function. It is a matter of our pride that we got the opportunity to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with the Gandhi Peace Prize.” India had conferred the prestigious award posthumously on Sheikh Mujib for the year 2020 just ahead of the visit.   PM Modi also praised the leadership of his counterpart Sheikh Hasina and mentioned the rapid strides in development made by Bangladesh under her leadership. He said Bangladesh had proved those wrong who had raised doubts and questioned the identity of Bangladesh. He also spoke about the current strong ties between the two nations, the supply of Indian-manufactured Covid vaccines to Bangladesh and landmark agreements between the two nations such as the Land Boundary Agreement. “We must remember that we've similar opportunities in fields of trade and commerce, but at the same time, we've similar threats like terrorism. The ideas and powers behind such types of inhumane acts are still active. We must remain vigilant and united to counter them,” PM Modi said, adding that both India and Bangladesh have the power of democracy and vision for the future, and it is necessary for the region the two countries progress together. “That is why Indian and Bangladeshi governments are making meaningful efforts in this direction,” he said. \r\n \r\nDuring the course of the day, he also met met Political leaders from Bangladesh’s ruling 14 Party Alliance and discussed “diverse issues of bilateral relations were held during the meeting to strengthen ties between the two nations”. But he also met met and interacted with opposition leaders from various political parties of Bangladesh. Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Dr A.K. Abdul Momen also called on PM Modi. Apart from this, PM Modi also met the Community leaders including Representatives of Minorities in Bangladesh, Bangladeshi Mukhtijoddhas (freedom fighters), Friends of India and Youth Icons.   Meanwhile, Bangladesh Police said four bodies of members of Hefazat-e-Islam, a hardline Islamist group, were brought to Chittagong Medical College Hospital after violence erupted at Hathazari, a rural town where the group's main leaders are based. “We got four bodies here. They are all hit with bullets. Three of them are madrasa students and another a tailor,” Alauddin Talukder, a police inspector at the hospital, told news agency AFP. He said at least four other demonstrators were critically injured but did not say who opened fire. Ruhul Amin, the government administrator of Hathazari town, said upto 1,500 supporters of Hefazat attacked a police station chanting anti-Modi slogans. “They attacked us all of a sudden,\" he said, without confirming whether any protesters were killed. Hathazari is home to one of Bangladesh's largest madrasas and is the headquarters of the Hefazat, which was formed in 2010 and is believed to be the country's largest hardline Islamist outfit.   According to other international news agency reports, by Friday afternoon, hundreds of protesters had also gathered outside Dhaka’s Baitul Mokarram Mosque after which violent clashes broke out after one faction of protesters began waving their shoes as a sign of disrespect to PM Modi, while another group tried to stop them. Protesters reportedly threw stones at the police, who were heavily present on the streets near the Mosque.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162600", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "19228", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.jagran.com", "section": "\n", "sub_section": ["/topics/farmers-protest"], "article_url": "https://www.jagran.com/haryana/panchkula-haryana-home-minister-anil-vij-said-talk-to-farmers-again-21548590.html", "title": null, "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "जेएनएन, चंडीगढ़। वरिष्ठ भाजपा नेता व हरियाणा के गृह एवं स्वास्थ्य मंत्री अनिल विज ने केंद्रीय कृषि मंत्री नरेंद्र तोमर को पत्र लिखकर कृषि कानूनों के खिलाफ आंदोलनरत किसानों से फिर से वार्ता शुरू करने की अपील की है। विज ने हरियाणा में बढ़़ रहे कोरोना वायरस के मामलों पर चिंता व्यक्त करते हुए लिखा कि हजारों किसान हरियाणा की सीमा पर बैठे हैं। उनसे दोबारा वार्ता शुरू कर इस मामले को निपटाया जाना चाहिए। विज को चिंता है कि जिस तरीके से कोरोना लगातार अपनी जड़े पसार रहा है ऐसे में यदि किसी किसान आंदोलनकारियों को यह वायरस अपनी चपेट में लेगा तो तो एक बड़ा कोरोना ब्लास्ट प्रदेश की सीमा पर हो सकता है । विज ने अपने पत्र में एक बार फिर तीनों कृषि कानूनों पर किसान संगठनों से बातचीत शुरू करने के लिए केंद्रीय कृषि मंत्री नरेंद्र सिंह तोमर से आग्रह किया। यह भी पढ़ें:  \n  विज ने लिखा, आज पूरे देश में कोरोना का कहर फिर नजर आने लगा है। हरियाणा में भी हालात बिगड़ने लगे हैं। हरियाणा में कोरोना को नियंत्रित करने के लिए संभव उपाय किए जा रहे हैं, लेकिन मेरी चिंता हरियाणा के बार्डर पर जो हजारों आंदोलनकारी किसानों को लेकर है, क्योंकि मुझको उनको भी कोरोना से बचाना है। यह भी चिंता है कि उनकी वजह से बाकी हरियाणा में भी कहीं कोरोना न फैल जाए। \n  यह भी पढ़ें:  विज ने लिखा कि आंदोलन में होने की वजह से वो कोविड के नियमों का पालन नहीं कर पा रहे हैं मैं जानता हूं कि आपने (नरेंद्र तोमर) किसानों की समस्या को हल करने के लिए बहुत प्रयास किए हैं और किसानों के साथ कई दौर की वार्ता भी की है, लेकिन किन्हीं कारणों से अभी तक समस्या का समाधान नहीं निकल पाया है। पिछले लंबे समय से वार्ता बंद होने से अनिश्चितता का माहौल बना हुआ है। मैं ऐसा मानता हूं कि समस्या का समाधान वार्ता से ही हो सकता है। \n  तोमर को लिखेे पत्र में विज ने कहा, मैं आपसे अनुरोध करता हूं कि वार्ता को फिर शुरू किया जाए, ताकि बातचीत करके इस मसले को सुलझाया जा सके और यहां से यह धरना समाप्त हो सके। सरकार का हमेशा इस बारे में सकारात्मक रूख रहा है। मैं उम्मीद करता हूं कि किसान भी अब इसमें सकारात्मक रूख अपनाएंगे। यह मामला हल हो जाएगा तथा जो जमावड़ा लगा हुआ है वह यहां से समाप्त हो जाएगा। सब अपने अपने घरों को वापस चले जाएंगे। बढ़ते हुए कोरोना को देखते हुए ऐसा प्रतीत हो रहा है कि कोरोना की लड़ाई लंबी लड़नी पड़ सकती है और इसके लिए सभी वर्गों का सहयोग मिलना आवश्यक है।  \n  यह भी पढ़ें:  \n \n", "image_url": "<img id=\"jagran_image_id\" src=\"//www.jagranimages.com/images/newimg/11042021/11_04_2021-anildavij_21548590.jpg\" alt=\"हरियाणा के गृह एवं स्वास्थ्य मंत्री अनिल विज की फाइल फोटो।\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162548", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

According to the plan, one of the arrestees hired a microbus the day before the incident. After the Rab members negotiated the ransom, they also rented an auto rickshaw to get the money from the victim's family members. Police apprehended two Rab members when they went to pick up the ransom. Yesterday, three witnesses, including the microbus driver and the auto rickshaw driver, made statements before a Dhaka court. The three are: Ayub Ali, 35, driver of the auto rickshaw; Sumon Ali, 33, driver of the microbus in which the victim was kept; and Iqbal Hossain, 52, a distant uncle of the victim. Metropolitan Magistrate Md Atiqul Islam recorded their statements yesterday afternoon, court sources said. On Thursday, police arrested three Rab members and a member of the air force for abducting and torturing Tamzid Hossain, 27, and demanding ransom for his release. The arrestees are: Lance Corporal Dulal Mridha, 32, posted at operations wing of Rab headquarters and allegedly planned and led the abduction; soldier Rokon Mia, 34, of intelligence wing of Rab HQ; Corporal Rony, 26, from the air force; and soldier Md Sagar, 28, of investigation, forensic wing of Rab HQ. Ranu Begum, 45, of Gazipur, was arrested and is on a two-day remand. Police also found involvement of two more Rab members who are on the run. \"We think, it's a pre-planned incident. The Rab member Dulal is known to the air force officer Rony who hired the microbus the day before the incident … Ranu introduced herself as a broker in [garments] business. But we think, she targets people and gets the job done for this group\" said a police official wishing not to be named. In a statement under section 164 of the CRPC before a Dhaka court on Saturday, Tamzid said he was abducted by the elite force members after he went to meet Ranu in the capital's Uttara to discuss starting a business of garment products. He also gave a description of the abduction before the court. He described how he was held inside a vehicle that went around various parts of the city. A source said the victim owed the woman money and she approached one of the four through another man to realise it. On Thursday, the four allegedly picked up Tamzid and demanded money from his family over the phone. Tamzid's family informed police about the abduction and police made the arrests. The next day, the victim's sister Rayana Hossain filed a case with Hatirjheel Police Station. She did not mention the names and designations of the accused. The victim and his family members have left their home on Friday and were staying at an undisclosed location out of fear, police sources said. Police has handed over the three arrested Rab officers to the elite force. Rab Legal and Media Wing Director Commander Khandaker Al Moin told The Daily Star, \"Our special investigation cell has started investigation. The investigators are talking to the arrestees and the witnesses. The investigation cell will prepare a probe report.

The massive Ever Given, a Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship that carries cargo between Asia and Europe, got stuck Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal. In the time since, authorities have been unable to remove the vessel and traffic through the canal — valued at over $9 billion a day — has been halted, further disrupting a global shipping network already strained by the coronavirus pandemic.   The Dutch-flagged Alp Guard and the Italian-flagged Carlo Magno, called in to help tugboats already there, reached the Red Sea near the city of Suez early Sunday, satellite data from MarineTraffic.com showed. The tugboats will nudge the 400-meter-long (quarter-mile-long) Ever Given as dredgers continue to vacuum up sand from underneath the vessel and mud caked to its port side, said Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which manages the Ever Given. Workers planned to make two attempts Sunday to free the vessel coinciding with high tides, a top pilot with the canal authority said. “Sunday is very critical,” the pilot said. “It will determine the next step, which highly likely involves at least the partial offloading of the vessel.”   Taking containers off the ship likely would add even more days to the canal’s closure, something authorities have been desperately trying to avoid. It also would require a crane and other equipment that have yet to arrive. The pilot spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as he wasn’t authorized to brief journalists. On Saturday, the head of the Suez Canal Authority told journalists that strong winds were “not the only cause” for the Ever Given running aground, appearing to push back against conflicting assessments offered by others. Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei said an investigation was ongoing but did not rule out human or technical error.   Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement maintains that their “initial investigations rule out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding.” However, at least one initial report suggested a “blackout” struck the hulking vessel carrying some 20,000 containers at the time of the incident. Rabei said he remained hopeful that dredging could free the ship without having to resort to removing its cargo, but added that “we are in a difficult situation, it’s a bad incident.” Asked about when they expected to free the vessel and reopen the canal, he said: “I can’t say because I do not know.” Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the company that owns the vessel, said it was considering removing containers if other refloating efforts failed.   The Ever Given is wedged about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the canal’s Red Sea entrance near the city of Suez. A prolonged closure of the crucial waterway would cause delays in the global shipment chain. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures. About 10% of world trade flows through the canal. The closure could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Already,   amid concerns of delays of shipments arriving amid the blockage. As of early Sunday, over 320 ships waited to travel through the Suez, either to the Mediterranean or the Red Sea, according to canal services firm Leth Agencies. Dozens of others still listed their destination as the canal, though shippers increasingly appear to be avoiding the passage.   The world’s biggest shipping company, Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk, warned its customers that it would take anywhere from three to six days to clear the backlog of vessels at the canal. Already, the firm and its partners have 22 ships waiting there. “The current number (of) redirected Maersk and partner vessels is 14 and expected to rise as we assess the salvage efforts along with network capacity and fuel on our vessels currently en route to Suez,” the shipper said. Mediterranean Shipping Co., the world’s second-largest, said it already had rerouted at least 11 ships around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope to avoid the canal. It turned back two other ships and said it expected “some missed sailings as a result of this incident.”   “MSC expects this incident to have a very significant impact on the movement of containerized goods, disrupting supply chains beyond the existing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,” it said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162600", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18011", "source": "scrapy"},

In today’s post-COVID-19 world, the visitor figures are about 60 per cent of monthly capacity. Some things have not changed, however; for instance, a number of people think it is acceptable not to shower before entering the pool, the programme   finds out in a series of vox pops. Others may even pee in the pool, thinking that chlorine is used to disinfect the water. The problem, however, is that urine and sweat contain ammonia, which reduces the effect that chlorine has on the water. So what is being done to keep the pools sufficiently clean to protect swimmers from bacteria and viruses, which can enter the water? And what is the principal reason why one should shower before swimming? Marchwood Laboratory Services technical manager Tan Thuan Piang, who has sampled Singapore’s pool waters with his team for over 15 years, noted that ammonia in pools, though mainly from sweat and urine, also comes from sunscreen lotion and cosmetics. While the amount of ammonia in Singapore’s pools is usually “minute” — low enough to escape detection — a possible reason for this is that ammonia “reacts very fast” with chlorine in the water to form the by-product chloramine, he said. When there is a “heavy chlorine smell”, it is usually tri-chloramine, a type of chloramine formed as the ammonia level rises and “not the chlorine we really want”, cited Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder. “It’s a nuisance,” said the professor, who has studied water quality and safety for more than 20 years. “As the chlorine forms chloramine, there’s less chlorine there. So we have to … add more chlorine to keep the level safe. “If we don’t practise good hygiene, the amount of chlorine in a swimming pool will drop quickly and make it less safe … The more hygiene we have, the less ammonia there’ll be and the cleaner the pools stay.” This is why he “always” advocates showering before entering the pool — to minimise the amount of chemicals it needs. Chloramine can also have a more direct effect on swimmers. National Skin Centre consultant dermatologist Lucinda Tan, who handles two to three patients a month for swimming-related conditions, said chloramines can “irritate and dry the skin” by stripping away the skin’s natural protective oil. “This allows dust, bacteria (and) allergens to enter and cause irritation. A normal person with normal skin … may get away with that,” she said. “You break a lot of the skin barrier, and you allow a lot of germs to enter, and then you can get bad infections,\" she added. “If your immune system is compromised … and (you have) a small cut and whatnot, you can still pick up an infection that can potentially worsen with time.” She noted that all exposed parts of the body, including the hair and eyes, can be affected. People may also end up with a dry and itchy throat if they swallow “a little bit more” pool water. And some children may be more susceptible to dry, irritating skin than adults. To maintain safety, there are national standards for the chlorine level in Singapore’s swimming pools: It must be between one to three parts per million. “Too little chlorine (and) it’d encourage algae to form. Too much chlorine (and) you’d feel the itch and discomfort on (your) skin,” said Jonas Su, operations director of pool maintenance company Anwill. Normally, at the end of a servicing, his team adds chlorine even if the pool passes muster, as the reading would drop. “By adding a little bit more, probably it’ll shoot up … still within the ideal range,” he said. “It’ll last for a few days before we come again.” Other parameters for testing pool cleanliness include the pH value, colour and turbidity (cloudiness) of the water. By regulation, the pH value — which shows the level of acidity or alkalinity — should be between 7.2 and 7.8. But when Talking Point submitted samples from 10 public pools — in Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bishan, Clementi, Jalan Besar, Jurong East, Kallang Basin, Queenstown, Tampines and Yishun — to Marchwood for testing, half of them were not within this range. “It’s not a concern,” said Marchwood’s Tan, who described the readings of 8.1 to 8.3 as “slightly higher”. “But any pH that’s above nine will cause some skin irritation.” Marchwood also tested the samples for faecal bacteria, namely E. coli and the coliform count. By the National Environment Agency’s standards, there should not be more than 200 bacteria per millilitre of water. And all the samples met this standard as well as the other test parameters. Besides adding chlorine to pools, the cleaning process includes scooping up debris and vacuuming the bottom of the pools. This can be a laborious task. What swimmers can do for personal hygiene on their part is relatively simple, however, like having a quick rinse before entering the pool to get rid of dirt, as well as applying moisturiser and sunblock if needed. Although moisturisers would contribute to the formation of chloramine, Tan the dermatologist said their use would help buffer the effects of chlorine or chloramine on skin. There are “two broad groups” of moisturisers: One has the “building blocks” of skin to repair the skin; the other acts as a protective barrier. “So it depends on a patient’s preference and the skin conditions,” she said. “Generally, you’d want something slightly oilier because you want the moisturiser to last for the duration of the swim … The ones that are more water-resistant would help as well.\" She also recommended having a rinse immediately after leaving the pool to “get rid of all the chlorine”.

One faction is led by Salahuddin Ahmed alias Salehin, also the present ameer of the JMB. This group has a network in different states of India and its strongholds are in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The second faction is led by Jahidul Islam Mizan alias Boma Mizan, a top bomb expert of the outfit, and its stronghold is in Bardhaman. And the third one is led by Ezaj Sheikh, an Indian, which mainly has strongholds in different districts of West Bengal.  Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) officials of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit claimed to have gotten the information of JMB's Indian wing from Rezaul Haque alias Reza, 37. Reza, who was the in-charge of JMB in Bangladesh, was arrested by BDU team from the capital's Badda on Saturday. A Dhaka court yesterday placed Reza on a seven-day remand after SM Raisul Islam, an inspector of CTTC unit, produced him before the court with a 10-day remand prayer in a case filed under the anti-terrorism act with Bhatara Police Station in November last year. Rahmatullah Chowdhury, in-charge of BDU, told The Daily Star yesterday, \"We got some important information about the outfit's Indian part's activities and network details from Reza.\" \"We are now analysing the information to know the outfit's activities in India,\" he added. Salehin went into hiding and took shelter in India after he was snatched from a prison van in February 2014, along with Boma Mizan. After the two fled to India, the outfit's activities speeded up in the country and a new chapter -- Jama'atul Mujahideen India (JMI) -- was declared in 2018, say investigators. But conflicts developed between Salehin and Mizan over procedure. Salehin was busy establishing the outfit's network between Bangladesh and India but Mizan wanted immediate actions. For this reason, in 2017, Mizan formed a separate faction with Indian national Ezaj, said a high official of CTTC unit, quoting Reza as saying. \"Mizan and Ezaj, however, formed separate factions after Mizan started suspecting Ezaj to be an Indian intelligence agent,\" said the official, requesting anonymity. On August 6, 2018, India's Intelligence Bureau and elite anti-terror probe body, National Investigation Agency, arrested Mizan from Bengaluru. The CTTC official in Bangladesh said they believed Ezaj was also arrested by Indian law enforcers, but did not get any confirmation. \"We are now trying to find out who is leading the factions of Ezaj and Mizan in their absence,\" the official told this newspaper. Of the three factions, Salehin's group is the strongest in India and it has supporters in most states of the country, the official said, quoting Reza as saying. JMB leaders Soleman, Firoz, Tareq and Jamai were mainly working for Salehin's faction in India and spreading the network, said investigators. However, Soleman and Jamai are believed to be in Indian jails, following their arrest by Indian law enforcers. There has been no trace of Firoz and Tareq for a long time, they said, based on the outfit's international communication details. Reza told investigators that Salehin has been staying in isolation for this reason for a long time and he has no connection with other leaders of the outfit in India now. \"We have learnt that Salehin did not take any financial support from Bangladesh to operate the outfit's activities in India. We are now trying to find out from where and how money is going to JMI,\" said another CTTC official. Rahmatullah, also the additional deputy commissioner of CTTC unit, said they were trying to find out details of JMB's network between Bangladesh and India.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-6\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/2021/04/10/reza.jpg?itok=EXVZboWa&amp;c=22b6bde8a0b456b75f27ae1fe3213fa5\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162600", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17806", "source": "scrapy"},

Photo: Reuters", "text": "After suffering for more than a year since March 2020, when we were just about to have some respite following the decline in infection and death rates, the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has returned with greater vengeance. With the virus spreading fast, uncertainty is looming large. And the concerns are compounded by the inadequacy of health infrastructure and economic opportunities. There is uncertainty about health and treatment. Uncertainty also prevails in case of livelihoods, income and overall economic situation of the country. Bangladesh economy, like the global economy, is still struggling to recover from the adverse impacts of the pandemic. About two thirds of the fiscal year (FY) 2021 has passed. Economic indicators are not showing much promise. A number of macroeconomic and sectoral indicators have performed below the expected level compared to a normal year. We were happy to see that Bangladesh economy had done far better than other countries in FY 2020 in terms of economic growth. And after about halfway through FY 2021, we started to discuss whether the economy is on its way towards a recovery and what strategies should be taken to make the recovery happen for all sectors. Unfortunately, that discussion for the time being has taken a back seat as the world is once again struggling to deal with the health crisis. After a somewhat relaxed lockdown for seven days from April 5, the government now plans a week-long stricter lockdown from April 14. In view of the sufferings of the people and consequences for the economy of the lockdown in 2020, the government has been mindful this time and is taking steps in a measured way. While the health crisis seems to be unstoppable, the economic crisis is no less serious. Indeed, the government had to undertake a large amount of expenditures in 2020 due to the outbreak of the pandemic which was unforeseen and unplanned. These were to mitigate the economic losses of the people and the businesses in various sectors. The government announced a number of stimulus packages equivalent to 4.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for the large businesses, export-oriented industries, small enterprises, agriculture sector, and social safety net programmes. Since the stimulus packages were mostly in the form of liquidity support through commercial banks, the government had also introduced expansionary monetary policy measures to create liquidity for the banks. However, these support measures were not adequate compared to the losses incurred by people. Exports  are yet to rebound, employment has not been regained, and many micro,  small and medium enterprises (MSME) have not received stimulus packages even though the allocation remains undisbursed. As for the poor, allocation under the social safety net programmes has been inadequate and distribution remains flawed. In this context, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) is preparing to chalk out the national budget for FY 2021-22. The task is a daunting one. During the ongoing fiscal year, the MoF had the difficult task to generate additional resources to finance higher government expenditure on the one hand, and utilise those resources efficiently for employment generation without creating inflationary pressure, on the other. Unfortunately, this challenge will continue to exist in the upcoming fiscal year also. This job could be more difficult since the government had limited success in achieving this objective. During July-December of FY2021, growth in revenue collection was 8.6 percent. However, this growth is far too low if the targets have to be met. Thus, in order to meet the target for FY2021, revenue collection has to grow by more than 74 percent during the next six months (January-June 2021). This seems unachievable, if the past records are considered. Growth of income tax has been negative (-) 5.2 percent during July-December of FY2021. So, income tax has to grow by more than 80 percent during the last six months of FY2021. Of course, lower tax collection during the ongoing fiscal year could be due to some tax exemptions to a few sectors in view of the pandemic. But without strengthening institutional capacity of the National Board of Revenue, the revenue mobilisation effort will continue to fall short of the targets even during the post-pandemic period. The other side of the fiscal framework is even more ironical. As opposed to the constrained fiscal space, the government could not also spend whatever was allocated. We have not seen any expansionary fiscal policy even though this was one of the crucial ways to energise the subdued economy. Rather, public expenditure during July-February of FY2021 was lower compared to the pre-pandemic period. The Annual Development Plan (ADP) has been downsized by Tk 7,502 crore in the current fiscal year. The target budget deficit in FY2021 has been set at six percent of GDP. However, till now the trend in fiscal balance indicates lower deficit. As of December 2021, a deficit of Tk 8,408 crore was observed compared to Tk 35,751 crore in December 2020. Lower deficit in fiscal balance is due to a fall in the public expenditure. This is opposite to the suggestions of stimulating domestic demand and strengthening supply response by expansionary fiscal policy. So, the MoF will have to take a more realistic approach in estimating the numbers for the upcoming budget. The need for a stronger fiscal framework is felt more than ever before. While the revenue targets will have to be met for more resources to tackle the fallout from the pandemic, the reform of the tax system should be initiated and continued parallelly. The budget must also make higher allocation in a number of priority sectors such as health, education and skills development, rural infrastructure, and social protection. Sadly, the budget for FY2021 did not see much increase in these areas. For example, despite a pandemic year, allocation for health sector as a share of GDP increased from 0.84 percent in FY2020 to only 0.92 percent in FY2021. The reason for low allocation is often attached to utilisation capacity of resources by the respective ministries. Moreover, despite low allocations, the numbers are revised downwards toward the end of the fiscal year due to the lack of spending capacity. Therefore, the allocation will have to be utilised in an efficient manner. Finally, in order to formulate a \"pandemic budget\" which will plan and implement higher public expenditure targeting larger population and with higher efficiency, the MoF should review the effectiveness of the measures announced in the ongoing budget. The MoF must not focus too much on growth, but on protecting the livelihoods of people and helping the economic sectors and enterprises survive. It does not matter much if we have lower growth in a pandemic year. But what matters is to have a hospital bed for the Covid patient, a job for the youth, cash in people's hand and food to feed themselves and their family. Budgetary measures should be focused towards achieving these objectives.   Dr Fahmida Khatun is the Executive Director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-very-big-1\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/feature/images/2021/04/11/bangladesh-economy-struggling-pandemic.jpg?itok=ku1Y-17V\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162600", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "19423", "source": "scrapy"},

The declarations were made over the official Pakistan radio station, which called on government employees in East Pakistan to return to work. In addition, citizens in Dhaka were warned by the press and radio to take precautions in case there should be an outbreak of cholera. The radio also reported that an army column had advanced unimpeded from Dhaka 70 miles northwest to Pabna. The troops \"did not encounter any subversive or antisocial elements\" on the way, the radio station said. An Indian government spokesman said today that the Pakistani army continued to hold onto major towns and garrisons in East Pakistan, but that it had been forced by frequent ambushes to move down main roads in units of battalion size or larger. Quoting from intelligence reports, the spokesman said although Chittagong was in army hands, the road leading north to Dhaka ran through territory was held by \"insurgents\" who had declared their independence from the western wing. He said the road was disrupted at several points and that ferry operators who had supported the \"insurgents\" had moved vessels away from crossing points. As a result, he said, supplies coming by sea from West Pakistan were being sent up the river to the town of Chandpur for unloading and convoying to Dhaka. \n The Pakistani government announced today that it had received a note from Premier Chou En‐lai of China strongly supporting its efforts to put down a movement for autonomy in East Pakistan. The government said that Chou had denounced the United States, the Soviet Union and India for \"carrying out gross interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan\" and had promised China's support \"should the Indian expansionists dare to launch aggression against Pakistan\". In reporting Chou's statements, the Pakistani government's news agency said that they had come in a letter to President Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan. In his letter, the Chinese premier praised President Yahya, saying \"Your Excellency and the leaders of various quarters in Pakistan have done a lot of useful work to uphold the unification of Pakistan and to prevent it from moving toward a split. \"In our opinion,\" the letter continued, \"the unification of Pakistan and the unity of the people of East and West Pakistan are basic guarantees for Pakistan to attain prosperity and strength. The Chinese government holds that what is happening in Pakistan at present as purely an internal affair of Pakistan which can only be settled by the Pakistani people and which brooks no foreign interference whatever.\" Soviet Premier Kosygin met separately today with the Pakistan and Indian ambassadors as part of an apparently growing Soviet effort to seek a solution to the crisis in East Pakistan. Diplomatic sources said the Soviet Union was deeply concerned over continued bloodshed in East Pakistan and the resulting charges and countercharges between the Pakistan and Indian governments that have led China to speak out on the side of Pakistan. The wide publicity given to the meetings by the Soviet media indicated a Soviet desire to underscore Moscow's effort to remain impartial, even though the Kremlin had already publicly criticised the use of force to quell the East Pakistani independence movement. The United States announced today that it is suspending aid shipments of wheat to East Pakistan because of congestion in East Pakistani ports caused by \"civil strife\" there. The Indian foreign ministry today denied a Pakistani charge that two companies of Indian border security forces had crossed into East Pakistan and the Pakistani army had \"wiped them out\".

New Zealand Rugby is close to approving plans for the 2021 and 2022 seasons, which will likely involve trans-Tasman matches next year and a New Zealand-based Pacific Islands team from 2022. Teams from New Zealand and Australia haven’t played each other since March when the full Super Rugby competition was abandoned because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The 2021 season will see a continuation of the successful Super Rugby Aotearoa competition involving home-and-away matches among New Zealand’s five Super Rugby teams, this time with a one-off final added. That tournament might then be followed by a series of crossovers between the New Zealand teams and Australia’s five Super Rugby teams, which likely will have completed their own domestic tournament. The establishment of that competition depends on a cooling of the currently heated relationship between Australian and New Zealand rugby unions. New Zealand Rugby is eager to added a Pacific Island team from 2022, to be based in South Auckland, and has received expressions of interests from several potential team organizations. Introducing that team in 2021 is unlikely because recruitment for next season is already underway and that would place the Pacifika team at a disadvantage. The 2022 Super Rugby tournament would comprise a minimum of eight teams, including the Pacific team. Several expressions of interests have been received from teams eager to participate and the tournament might be larger. The New Zealand Herald newspaper has reported bids from teams based in Fiji and Hong Kong are among those being considered. New Zealand Rugby is likely to decide the new tournament size and formats by late November. It’s aim is to find a sustainable and commercially successful Super Rugby tournament, even if the coronavirus continues to impact international travel. The 2021 tournament will not include South Africa which has decided to compete in the northern hemisphere from next season, at least temporarily.

Chasing 166 for victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday, CSK fell short by by seven runs, with skipper Dhoni staying unbeaten on 47 off 36 balls. “I was not able to middle a lot of deliveries. Was trying to hit it too hard. When the wicket is slightly at the slower side, it is better to time it. Looking at outfield it was subconsciously coming to us to hit the ball hard,” Dhoni said. This was his side’s third defeat in four matches. Asked about his struggle towards the end, Dhoni said,” I tried to get as much as time as possible. It is quite dry out here. So, the throat gets dry and you start to cough. When you have legal signs, you can take some time off.” Dhoni made three changes to his playing XI but could not arrest the slide. He acknowledged that they need to find solutions. “Long time back once we lost three in a row. We need to get a lot of things right. It is the professionalism. We need to take our catches, not bowl no-balls. Those are the controllables and may be we are getting too relaxed,” he said. “We have been a bit too relaxed at times. After the 16th over, we had two good overs but overall we could have been slightly better. “Nobody wants to drop catches but at this level, we need to draw a line and say these catches that need to be taken, especially when the team hasn’t been doing that outstandingly well,” he said, referring to the spilled chances when SRH’s Abhishek Sharma was batting. “Catches like these can hamper your knockout stage games. It is very important to be at your best. There are plenty of positives in this game but we will try to come back strong.” SRH skipper David Warner took a big gamble by asking 18-year old Abdul Samad to bowl the final over when CSK needed 28 runs. The Australian defended his decision. “I backed him (Samad). I had no option. We tried to kill the game in the 19th over with Khaleel there with five balls to bowl. Could have given it to Abhishek, but Samad with his height and the way he bowled tonight, he had to bowl the last one,” said Warner. He also praised Proyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma for their gritty batting under pressure. “It’s my message to the youngsters, to go out their and score some runs.

It’s caused quite the stir among not only the border security bureau, but also the troops near the Hyesan area,” a military official from Hyesan told RFA’s Korean Service Monday. “The six were on nighttime stakeout at the border on the night of the 2  and did not show up after their scheduled return time in the early morning. A search team combed the entire border area looking for them. It was determined that the six had crossed the river with their weapons and escaped to China,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. Soldiers in the North Korean military are not adequately supplied by the government. It is not uncommon to see soldiers in uniform working on farms to make enough food to supply their unit. But under normal circumstances, soldiers posted at the border are in a relatively privileged situation and can easily find ways to make enough money to support themselves. Many accept bribes to look the other way when smugglers shuttle goods into and out of the country, while others do the smuggling themselves. However, smuggling came to a near halt at the start of coronavirus pandemic. In January 2020, Beijing and Pyongyang shut down the Sino-Korean border and suspended all trade, with disastrous effect on the North Korean economy. To further deter people from crossing the border Pyongyang in the summer established a kill zone, warning that anyone found within one kilometer of the border would be shot on sight. Authorities also ordered border security to lay land mines along some parts of the border and sent special forces to keep a watchful eye on the border guards. “Usually, border guard soldiers are in collusion with professional smugglers and bundle merchants, and they live better than soldiers in other regions. But the coronavirus outbreak has been raging for more than a year, so smuggling has completely stopped, and they are suffering from hunger these days,” the source said. “Both professional and amateur smugglers can’t even approach the border in times like this. There’s a shoot-to-kill order from the General Command, and the intensity of border security is much higher than in the past. The soldiers are all tired,” said the source. Another military source from Ryanggang Tuesday confirmed that the six soldiers from the 25  Brigade had escaped to China by crossing the Yalu River with their automatic rifles. “As this incident was reported to the Central Committee, the area around Hyesan and the border area was completely turned upside down,” said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “Border security command and a search team from the State Security department searched the border area and the city of Hyesan, but they concluded that the six border guard soldiers had already escaped to China,” the second source said. The second source said that the border guards are in such a privileged position that only those with good connections can join their ranks. “They are better supplied, and they can more easily make extra income than other military units. Border guards don’t actually guard the border, they take money from Chinese and North Korean smugglers who illegally cross the border. They lived quite well before the coronavirus,” said the second source. “The soldiers' motives for escaping North Korea are still unknown, but people assume that they either accidentally crossed the river to steal food because they were hungry, or they might have been planning to escape the country and finally executed their plan while on nighttime stakeout duty,” said the second source. The second source said that the border security bureau is in a state of chaos over the escape. One soldier escaping would be a problem, but six escaping together makes the case serious enough that the Central Committee of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party is paying close attention. “The General Command notified the Chinese border guards and requested cooperation in the search and arrest of the escaped soldiers, and China seems to be taking this case very seriously. Since the six soldiers are armed and dangerous, the Chinese guards must be very nervous about what could happen,” said the second source. “Residents of the border area have had a very difficult time making a living in the era of the coronavirus. The escape of the six soldiers has only increased tension in the border area with more frequent and thorough inspections,” the second source said. The six escapees are not the only ones responsible for their escape, according to the second source. “Even if they are caught, their entire company will be disbanded, and their commanders and anyone else involved will have to take responsibility, so it will be a bit of a bloodbath here for a while.”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162559", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12174", "source": "scrapy"},

All-rounder Marcus Stoinis was dropped on 30 by Yuzvendra Chahal, after which he went on to score a 26-ball 53 and power the Capitals to 196 for four at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Monday. Kohli himself had dropped KL Rahul twice in RCB’s loss to Kings XI Punjab earlier in the tournament. “Those important chances in between, we need to grab when the opportunity comes our way. It is not like we are dropping half chances, we are dropping sitters and those things hurt you,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony. “We got into the game after the first six and then Stoinis batted really well in the end, we gave him a life, he took the game away from us,” he added. Delhi were off to a flying start with openers Prithvi Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan adding 68 runs. The RCB bowlers were able to pull things back, picking up quick wickets before slipping again. “I think they got off to a great start in the first six then we pulled it back in the next eight overs and the last phase again got away from us,” Kohli said. RCB have won three of their five matches. However, both their losses have come while chasing big targets. “I think it is about rectifying those small mistakes. The conversation around chasing is always to have a big partnership, with the dew setting in had we kept 7-8 wickets at the end of 10 overs, the game would have been on,” Kohli said. Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer was delighted with his team’s all-round performance. “Our strategy was to be fearless and play with full freedom. We have got good youngsters in our side, so we just need to go out and execute our talent and skills. I am very happy with the way things are going so far, and we need to keep up the momentum,” Iyer said. “It is important for us to get a good recovery. It isn’t easy going back into the bio bubble, so we try to spend time with each other and that is working really well for us,” he added. Axer Patel (2/18), who came in to the side in place of the injured Amit Mishra, played a vital role in his side’s victory and was adjudged the Man of the Match. “I knew it was stopping on the wicket. I knew I would bowl in the Powerplay and I had practised for it as well. I executed my plans really well. “My plan after speaking to batsmen was that since the wicket was slow, I wanted to bowl at the stumps and vary the pace. “In the Powerplay I was in a mood to defend at first, but when the third ball spun I changed gears and got into an attack mode,” he said.

Children were among those killed on Saturday, Myanmar’s Armed Forces Day, according to news reports and witnesses, in a crackdown that drew renewed Western criticism. The UN investigator said the army was carrying out “mass murder”.   “We salute our heroes who sacrificed lives during this revolution and We Must Win This REVOLUTION,” one of the main protest groups, the General Strike Committee of Nationalities (GSCN), posted on Facebook. Saturday also brought some of the heaviest fighting since the coup between the army and the ethnic armed groups that control swathes of the country. Military jets had killed at least three people in a raid on a village controlled by an armed group from the Karen minority, a civil society group said on Sunday, after the Karen National Union faction earlier said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border, killing 10 people. The airstrikes sent villagers fleeing into the jungle.   A junta spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment on the killings or the fighting. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta leader, had said during a parade to mark Armed Forces Day that the military would protect the people and strive for democracy. Myanmar Now news portal said 114 people were killed across the country in crackdowns on the protests. The dead included 40 people, one of them a 13-year-old girl, in Myanmar’s second city of Mandalay. At least 27 people were killed in the commercial hub Yangon, Myanmar Now said. Another 13-year-old was among the dead in the central Sagaing region. Deaths were recorded from the Kachin region in the mountainous north to Taninthartharyi in the far south on the Andaman Sea - taking the overall number of civilians reported killed since the coup to more than 440.   ‘THIS BLOODSHED IS HORRIFYING’ U.S. Ambassador Thomas Vajda said on social media: “This bloodshed is horrifying,” adding “Myanmar’s people have spoken clearly: they do not want to live under military rule”. The EU delegation to Myanmar said Saturday would “forever stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour.” The top military officer from the United States and nearly a dozen of his counterparts joined to condemn the killings by Myanmar’s army. Their statement said that a professional military must follow international standards for conduct “and is responsible for protecting - not harming - the people it serves.”   UN Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said it was time for the world to take action - if not through the UN Security Council then through an international emergency summit. He said the junta should be cut off from funding, such as oil and gas revenues, and from access to weapons. “Words of condemnation or concern are frankly ringing hollow to the people of Myanmar while the military junta commits mass murder against them,” he said in a statement. “The people of Myanmar need the world’s support. Words are not enough. It is past time for robust, coordinated action.” Despite the Western condemnation, Myanmar’s junta has friends elsewhere.   Russia’s deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin attended Saturday’s military parade in Naypyitaw, having met senior junta leaders a day earlier. Diplomats said eight countries - Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand - sent representatives, but Russia was the only one to send a minister to the parade on Armed Forces Day, which commemorates the start of the resistance to Japanese occupation in 1945. Support from Russia and China, which has also refrained from criticism, is important for the junta as those two countries are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and can block potential U.N. actions.   The military has said it took power because November elections won by Aung San Suu Kyi’s party were fraudulent, an assertion dismissed by the country’s election commission. Suu Kyi remains in detention at an undisclosed location and many other figures in her party are also in custody. Myanmar’s embassy in London, which is under the control of junta opponents, said on Facebook that the ambassador met Suu Kyi’s son there on Thursday. Kim Aris had asked if the embassy could arrange a call with his mother, it said. “Kim asked about his mother’s situation, and her health. He is obviously extremely worried,” it said, adding that the ambassador had already sent three requests to Myanmar’s capital and would send another reminder.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162600", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17992", "source": "scrapy"},

It is dubbed as the Chinese version of the \"Mother of All Bombs\" due to its huge destructive potential that is claimed to be only second to nuclear weapons, the daily said. The bomb was airdropped by an H-6K bomber and caused a gigantic explosion, showed a promotional video released by China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) on its website at the end of December.  This is the first time the new bomb's destructive powers have been shown in public, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.  In April 2017, while waging war against militants in Afghanistan, the US military had dropped a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) weapon, more commonly known as the \"Mother of All Bombs,\" on the Islamic State. Although China is using the same nickname for its bomb, said to weigh several tonnes, the Chinese weapon is smaller and lighter than its American counterpart.  Judging from the video and the size of the H-6K's bomb bay, the bomb is approximately five to six meters long, Beijing-based military analyst Wei Dongxu told the Global Times on Thursday. \"The massive blast can easily and completely wipe out fortified ground targets such as reinforced buildings, bastions and defence shelters,\" Wei said. It can also be used to clear a landing zone for troops on helicopters to rappel down, in case the area is covered by obstacles such as forests, Wei noted. Wei said that the Chinese bomb is smaller and lighter than the US, enabling it to be deployed on the H-6K bomber. \"The US bomb is so large that it has to be carried by a larger transport aircraft rather than a bomber,\" Wei said, noting that a bomber can fly faster and is better at targeting than a transport aircraft, and the Chinese bomb's designer must have had this in mind when it produced the bomb to fit the H-6K. To match the US weapon, Russia developed the \"Father of All Bombs\" which is both bigger and thermobaric, meaning it uses gas to create a huge fireball rather than a shockwave, Wired reported.

As we mourn his passing, we remember the significant and remarkable life that he had led, dedicated first and foremost to service to the United Kingdom and its people, as well as to the peoples of the Commonwealth and the world at large. He had an indomitable spirit, fighting for peace and justice in the Second World War in his early years, and later steadfastly pursuing environmental causes, where he was well ahead of the times, and taking a close interest in sports and education. His selfless devotion to service has contributed much to advance and uplift the livelihoods of people in the United Kingdom and within the Commonwealth. We will also remember him for his steadfast support of Her Majesty The Queen.  One of his distinguished achievements was the creation of The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme over six decades ago. The awards nurtured and empowered young people to gain the skills, confidence and resilience to become exceptional individuals who can make a difference and contribute to society. The scheme also inspired Singapore’s own National Youth Achievement Award programme, which was launched in 1992. It was clear that the Duke of Edinburgh made education an utmost priority. He visited the National University of Singapore in 1972, and the United World College of Southeast Asia in 1989. He also met students from the Singapore Sports School during Her Majesty The Queen’s State Visit in 2006, where I had the great pleasure to meet him.

Throughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day. We have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh’s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959. The Duke of Edinburgh’s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.

The source said that authorities and residents refer to all patients with coronavirus symptoms as “suspected coronavirus patients.” Since the start of the pandemic in January 2020, North Korea has taken extensive measures to prevent the spread of the deadly virus, including the complete shutdown of the Sino-Korean border and the suspension of all trade with China, lockdowns of entire counties and cities, and a ban on travel between provinces. Pyongyang declared its “preventative measures” successful in April 2020 as Pak Myong Su, the director of the anti-epidemic department of North Korea’s Central Emergency Anti-Epidemic Headquarters, gave a rare interview with foreign media, where he said that “not a single person was infected” with the virus. Observers immediately doubted the claim, citing North Koreas’ crumbling medical infrastructure, the relative ease by which people could cross the Sino-Korean border, and the willingness of the regime to hide the truth from the international community. Additionally, RFA reported in April 2020 that the government warned the public through health lectures that COVID-19 had at that time been spreading in three specific areas of the country, including North Hamgyong. The survey conducted by the Ministry of Health earlier this month, which compiled data of “suspected coronavirus patients” and those who died from “related symptoms,” revealed some 13,000 cases in North Hamgyong, the most in the entire country. According to the survey’s results, reported to the ruling Korean Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, most of the suspected cases were in the cities, including the provincial capital Chongjin, North Korea’s third largest city and home to more than 600,000 people. The North Hamgyong official said that hospitals \"diagnose acute pneumonia for those who die after showing coronavirus symptoms. Everyone, including the family members of the deceased, thinks that they simply died from acute pneumonia.\" “The authorities say there are no confirmed cases, but they are restricting the movement of the residents much more strongly than before. This is causing the people to experience great difficulties in making a living, but they are warned of severe punishment if they violate movement restrictions while showing suspected coronavirus symptoms,” the source said. Another source, an official of the city of Rason, bordering Russia in the province’s northeast, told RFA Wednesday that the city had more than 6,000 confirmed cases. “There are dozens of people who have died from illness after showing coronavirus symptoms, but hospitals and public health centers only emphasize hand washing, masks, and disinfection with salt water. They don’t offer any special treatment or quarantine measures,” said the second source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. “In accordance with the orders of the Central Committee, the quarantine authorities, along with the administrative and judicial authorities, are fiercely cracking down on local gatherings and family events,” said the second source. The second source said authorities were using meetings of the local neighborhood watch units to tell the people to limit their movement as much as possible. “Authorities are asking people who show suspected coronavirus symptoms to report to quarantine stations or hospitals without delay, but the residents are hiding their symptoms because they are forced to stay in shabby medical facilities as soon as they come in.” The World Health Organization (WHO) did not respond to RFA inquiries regarding the nationwide statistical survey as of Thursday.

Myanmar military aircraft carried out three strikes overnight on Sunday into Monday, according to Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian relief agency that delivers medical and other assistance to villagers. The strikes possibly injured one person but caused no apparent fatalities, a member of the agency said.   Earlier Sunday, an estimated 3,000 people crossed the river dividing the two countries into Thailand's Mae Hong Son province following two days of aerial attacks. Video shot that day shows a group of villagers, including many young children, resting in a forest clearing inside Myanmar, having fled their homes. They carried their possessions in bundles and baskets. In Sunday's previous attacks, Myanmar military aircraft dropped bombs on a Karen guerrilla position in an area on the Salween River in Karen state's Mutraw district, according to workers for two humanitarian relief agencies. Two guerrillas were killed and many more were wounded in those attacks, said a member of the Free Burma Rangers.   On Saturday night, two Myanmar military planes twice bombed Deh Bu Noh village in Mutraw district, killing at least two villagers. The attacks may have been retaliation for the Karen National Liberation Army, which is fighting for greater autonomy for the Karen people, attacking and capturing a government military outpost on Saturday morning. According to Thoolei News, an online site that carries official information from the KNU, eight government soldiers including a second lieutenant were captured in the attack and 10 were killed, including a lieutenant colonel who was a deputy battalion commander. The report said one Karen guerrilla had been killed.   The tension at the frontier comes as the leaders of the resistance to last month's coup that toppled Myanmar's elected government are seeking to have the Karen and other ethnic groups band together and join them as allies, which would add an armed element to their struggle. The airstrikes mark an escalation in the increasingly violent crackdown by the Myanmar government against opponents of the February 1 military takeover. At least 114 people across the country were killed by security forces on Saturday alone, including several children a toll that has prompted a UN human rights expert to accuse the junta of committing mass murder and to criticise the international community for not doing enough to stop it.   The Security Council is likely to hold closed consultations on the escalating situation in Myanmar, UN diplomats said Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement. The council has condemned the violence and called for a restoration of democracy, but has not yet considered possible sanctions against the military, which would require support or an abstention by Myanmar's neighbour and friend China. The coup, which ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government, reversed years of progress toward democracy after five decades of military rule. It has again made Myanmar the focus of international scrutiny as security forces have repeatedly fired into crowds of protesters.   As of Sunday, at least 459 people have been killed since the takeover, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which has tallied deaths it was able to verify. The true toll is thought to be higher.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162603", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17514", "source": "scrapy"},

The Pakistani media reports had further claimed that if the confidence-building measures (CBMs) hold and ties improve further, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may pay a visit to Islamabad for the Saarc summit there later this year. The developments come in the wake of a sudden perceptible improvement in India-Pakistan ties in the past six weeks following the implementation of the ceasefire at the Line of Control by the armies of the two countries.   “Our respective high commissions exist and are functioning.

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday.   In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm.

According to them, nearly 3.5 lakh people, from Schedule Tribe and Scheduled Caste, are facing a threat of their livelihood. According to sources, the government completed 70 per cent of Polavaram project works by the end of December but only four percent of the R & R package was implemented. The Chief Minister aimed at completing the project by the year-end.   As per the 2017 statistics, 5,08,874 persons have been displaced and the number may increase. The state government had announced that 371 villages will be submerged due to the project and CCLA has given permission for providing R&R package to 164 villages. However, only 15 villages have been given partial R&R packages. \r\nIndian Association of Lawyers state executive member Inapurapu Suryanaryana said that the Comptroller and Audit General (CAG) found fault with the project as there is no MoU between Centre and the state government on construction of Polavaram project and advised the state government to reach a truce with the Union Government for the sake of the project.   To avoid submergence problems, the Centre advised state governments of Odisha and Chhattisgarh to construct protection walls at eight and four places, respectively. But, either has obliged. He said that the Union Government has also not taken any steps to have cases filed in the Supreme Court to be withdrawn by Odisha and Chhattisgarh.

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162604", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16252", "source": "scrapy"},

The 1,460 megawatt, U.S. $3 billion Luang Prabang dam will displace 581 families or 2,285 people and will affect 20 other villages in the northern provinces of Luang Prabang and Oudomxay. With an expected completion date of 2027, the dam is part of a planned cascade of 11 Mekong mainstream dams at the center of Laos’ controversial economic strategy to become the “Battery of Southeast Asia,” by selling the power to neighboring countries. RFA reported last month that UNESCO requested another impact assessment because it was concerned that the dam could alter the nearby 16  century royal capital of Luang Prabang, a World Heritage Site and top tourist draw, to the point that it no longer deserves the coveted designation. Additionally, the Lao government has yet to finalize the dam’s Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Thailand and Vietnam, raising questions about its financial viability. Villagers living nearby told RFA’s Lao Service that construction on the dam was imminent. “They’re building it. The preparation for the construction of the dam is at an advanced stage now. It looks like the Lao government is determined to build this dam despite all the obstacles,” a villager from Nga district in Oudomxay Province told RFA’s Lao Service. “Of course we’re worried. We’re worried about whether we’ll receive fair compensation and the relocation and where we’re going to move to. We don’t want to move, but we have no choice because it’s a government plan,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. Another resident of the district told RFA that the relocation of their entire village was pending. “Up until now we haven’t been informed about where we’ll move or when. The authorities came by not long ago to collect information about us and our property,” the second source said. A resident of Houey Yor village, within the area of Luang Prabang province that will be most affected by the dam, told RFA that construction was disturbing daily life in the village. “The scale of the construction is intensifying, and it goes on all day and all night. The workers are clearing, digging, and blasting rock and land. We can’t sleep and we have nowhere to complain,” the third source said. Some of the residents of Houey Yor have already received compensation for what they stand to lose to the dam or its construction, but the third source said few were satisfied with what they got. “About 30 families lost about 30 hectares (74 acres) of land, including their rice fields and gardens, and they received about 50 million kip [U.S. $5,245] per hectare. That’s not nearly what the land is worth, but they had to accept it because they don’t want any trouble,” the third source said. An official of the Luang Prabang’s Energy and Mines Department told RFA that the compensation was fair. “Those 30 families were compensated according to government assessment with set rules, laws and rates,” the official said. The official denied that construction on the actual dam had begun. “At this point, we don’t know for sure whether the dam will be built because we’re not sure whether the project will be approved by UNESCO or whether the PPA will be signed. If the project is not approved and the PPA is not signed, we’d be building all this infrastructure for nothing,” the official said.  reported Monday that Xaysomphone Phomvihanh, president of the Lao National Front for Construction visited the Luang Prabang Dam site Sunday and met the general manager of the Thai-owned Ch. Karchang Company, which built the currently operational Xayaburi Dam. During the visit, the Luang Prabang Dam’s Deputy Manager Weerayut Salumnont told the visitors that the dam would be complete in 2027. Three temporary ports have been completed, while service roads, a workers’ camp with water supply, and land clearance are about 99 percent complete. Meanwhile a Mekong river bridge, power lines and relay stations are in various stages of completion.  Additionally, the deputy manager said about 70 percent of compensation had been paid. Xaysomphone Phomvihanh said the Luang Prabang Dam project was one of the most important government development projects and that the developer should be mindful of the dam’s impact on the environment and people who live nearby. Laos has built dozens of hydropower dams on the Mekong and its tributaries under its plan to sell around 20,000 megawatts of electricity to neighboring countries by 2030. Though the Lao government sees power generation as a way to boost the country’s economy, the projects are controversial because of their environmental impact, displacement of villagers without adequate compensation, and questionable financial and power demand arrangements.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162604", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12677", "source": "scrapy"},

The jawan of 210 CoBRA battalion who was abducted by Maoists after the April 3 Naxal ambush on security forces in Terram on Sukma-Bijapur border in Chhattisgarh’s south Bastar region was handed over to a four-member emissary team, constituted by the Chhattisgarh government to negotiate his release, at an undisclosed location.   The jawan, with his hands tied, was produced before a \"jan adalat\" or kangaroo court of Maoists in the presence of scores of armed rebels, local villagers and mediapersons before being set free at 4 pm.   “The jawan has been released by Maoists. He has reached Basaguda camp (of CRPF),” Bijapur district superintendent of police Kamal Lochan Kashyap said. He was scheduled to be flown to Raipur after his medical checkup, police said. “As soon as we learnt that the jawan was held hostage by Maoists, we contacted eminent people in the region, social activists and mediapersons to secure his release from Maoist custody,” Mr Kashyap said.   Earlier in the morning, the four-member interlocutor team headed by Padma Shri Dharam Pal Jain left for an undisclosed location in the forest on Sukma-Bijapur border to negotiate the release of the jawan with the Maoists. “I was contacted by the government to become an interlocutor to negotiate release of the jawan. I left for the appointed place in the morning along with other members of the team and some media persons to secure release of the jawan. I am happy that Naxals kept their promise to release the jawan if approached by government-appointed emissaries,” Mr Jain said. The other members of the emissary team were local tribal community leader Telam Boraiya, retired teacher Rudra Kere and sarpanch of Surkunda panchayat in Bijapur district, Rukmni Ekka.   With relief writ large on his face, the jawan after his release told reporters, “They (Naxals) treated me well when I was in their custody”. As soon as he was handed over to the emissaries Mr Manhas contacted his family members in Jammu through the cell phone of a journalist present and informed them that he had been set free and was coming home very soon, a journalist who accompanied the delegation told this newspaper from the spot. Sources disclosed to this newspaper that the jawan was spotted by local villagers after the April 3 encounter who handed him to the Maoists. “Maoists had grilled him to extract information on the strength of the security forces deployed in the region and the kinds of weapons they use,” sources said.   Maoist guerillas led by commander of PLGA’s battalion number one Madvi Hidma ambushed a search party of security personnel in Terram area on April 3 killing 22 jawans and injuring 31 others.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162604", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17026", "source": "scrapy"},

After the the March 9 clash in Xaysomboun’s Thathom district, government troops spread out over a nearby mountain to track other fighters down, sources told RFA’s Lao Service, speaking on condition of anonymity for safety reasons. “Currently, the authorities won’t allow anyone to enter the fighting area,” a relative of one of the soldiers told RFA on Tuesday. “Some members of the anti-government force have escaped, and soldiers have been sent to the combat zone, which is on top of a mountain.” “Yes, there was a shooting incident in the area,” a former government military officer told RFA, while another source close to a high-ranking provincial military officer also confirmed reports of the clash. “It happened in early March,” the source said, also asking that his name not be used, “and the Xaysomboun authorities have sent a great number of provincial military troops to reinforce the forces in Thathom.” Soldiers from the province are now patrolling and blocking the roads in the areas nearby so that insurgents cannot recover the body of their fallen comrade, a villager in Thathom said, adding, “They normally won’t leave their friends behind, but the soldiers have captured the body now.” Persons are now prohibited from entering the area between Thathom district’s Vangkhan Point and Sobjae Point, according to a March 15 district office notice citing “military activity” in the area. The period of the ban runs from March 15 until March 30, says the notice, a copy of which was obtained by RFA. Thathom District Chief Phouthasath Noythavy meanwhile turned away requests for comment, saying “I’m not able to provide you with more details about this right now. I’m in a meeting.” Since 2000, Laos has sustained periodic shootings and bomb attacks on transportation hubs and border checkpoints by suspected insurgents. The March 9 clash was only the latest in a series of shootings and other attacks in Xaysomboun province, most recently on June 20, 2020 when a government soldier was shot and killed while on patrol inspecting for illegal poppy cultivation. In January 2016, a car carrying Chinese miners was ambushed in the province, leaving two dead and one injured, and in November 2015 an exchange of gunfire between an armed group and local troops left three soldiers and four civilians dead, sources said in earlier reports. In most cases, Laos’ secretive government stops short of identifying individuals or groups who might have perpetrated the attacks while there are no claims of responsibility or political statements issued in connection with the incidents. Authorities in multi-ethnic Laos have long been wary of opposition among the country's Hmong ethnic minority, many of whom say they face persecution from the government because of their ties with the United States during the Vietnam War, when thousands of Hmong fought under CIA advisers during the so-called “secret war” against communists in Laos.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"lao-fighters.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/clash-03182021163834.html/lao-fighters.jpg/@@images/c88b9e11-51b7-4036-a9b8-575ec267273c.jpeg\" title=\"lao-fighters.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162605", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12161", "source": "scrapy"},

The worker identified as Kung, 18, had lost his temper in the March 8 incident, which followed weeks of scolding by his Chinese boss, a resident of Pha Oy village in Bokeo’s Houaxay district and next-door neighbor to the shop told RFA’s Lao Service this week. “The two were arguing, and I heard that the Chinese man had scolded him many times,” the neighbor said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The Chinese man had scolded not only the teen but all his other employees, too.” “The shop has been closed since the incident, because the owner is now dead,” he added. Speaking to RFA on Thursday, a police officer in Houaxay district confirmed the fight had taken place. “The incident happened at a motorcycle shop,” the officer said, also speaking on condition his name not be used. “The employer and an employee were having a heated argument, and then a fight.” “Before the incident, the employer had often emotionally and physically abused his employees and sometimes injured them seriously,” another Pha Oy village resident said. “One of the employees then exploded and hit the boss, who is now dead. The attacker just started this job a couple of weeks ago.” Following the attack, the Lao teen—who gave his name as Kung under questioning by police—escaped by motorcycle but was captured two days later, a provincial police officer told Security News, an online news site of the Lao Ministry of Public Security. “Under interrogation, the attacker said that his name was Kung and that his employer was ‘too offensive,’ saying for example that when he arrived to work late one day, he was told he would not be allowed to eat lunch.” “On the day of the incident, Li Xiao—the employer—closed his shop, but Kung remained behind. And when the shop owner scolded him and yelled at him to leave, [Kung] snapped and knocked the owner to the floor and cut his throat,” the officer said. “He then ran to his motorcycle, which he had parked at a friend’s house, and sped away. But police arrested him in another village on March 10,” he said. The incident follows other reports of high-handed treatment of Lao workers by their Chinese bosses, and of increasing resentment over a growing Chinese business presence in the country. In June 2020, a young Lao worker, Lou Xiong, was beaten, shocked, and tied up by his employers at a Chinese banana plantation in Vientiane province in northwestern Laos in a dispute over long working hours, the worker’s relatives told RFA in an earlier report. Concern has also been growing in Laos over China’s growing influence as a result of its massive investment in hydropower dams, a major railway, and other infrastructure projects under Beijing’s $1.3 trillion Belt and Road Initiative.

Vadra said that its 'shocking' that the CBSE has decided to go ahead with exams despite parents expressing fears and 'apprehensions' about assembling at exam centres in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. She said these 'apprehensions' are not 'Unreasonable', so exams should be cancelled. She, in her letter said, \"It will be practically impossible to ensure the safety of students at large and at crowded exam centres. Additionally, given the nature and the spread of the virus, it is not just the students who will be at risk but also their teachers, invigilators and family members who are in contact with them. Aside from this, by forcing the children to sit for these exams during a raging pandemic, the Government and the CBSE board will be held responsible in the event that any of the exam centres prove to be hotspots at which large numbers of children become infected with the disease.\" The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has also appealed to the Centre to take a uniform decision on the board exams of Classes 10 and 12 across the country in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A unilateral decision by any state would lead to students of that state being at a disadvantage in terms of career and opportunities, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said in a letter, dated April 10, addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. \"Your intervention would mean national consensus, instead of a unilateral decision by any particular state,\" Sawant said in his letter.

This implies that kids remain active carriers of coronavirus even if their symptoms have subsided or even if they're simply asymptomatic. The study was published in Nature Medicine on March 13 and further reaffirmed the need to shut down schools globally in order to limit the contact of infected children with others. In the United States, local school districts have suspended all classroom activity. This has been replaced by the online model of schooling. According to this study, shutting down schools is in the best interests of the society for there's no clarity on whether children could pass the virus to others in the community. The study was led by Huimin Xia, of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, in Guangzhou, China. All 745 subjects were babies and children. The age-range stood between two months to 15 years, and the children were selected based on their \"close contact with diagnosed [COVID-19] patients or were members of families with reported familial outbreaks\". \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nOut of the 745, only 10 tested positive for the virus and were admitted to a treatment facility, simply with the aim to protect others around them. It's imperative to note here that none of them showed any significant illness. Additionally, none of the ten kids showed any severe symptoms. Even in the seven cases that developed fever, nobody exhibited a temperature of over 29 degrees Celsius. \"There were some instances of coughing, sore throat and nasal congestion,\" the journal news release noted, but \"none of the other symptoms commonly seen in adult patients, such as muscle ache and headache.\"  Further tests like x-rays displayed no signs of pneumonia among the children. However, children with mild symptoms or no symptoms may still be able to transfer the virus to vulnerable adults. The worst part is that the kids may sustain the virus for way longer than expected, which makes them a harmful carrier group, especially towards the susceptible groups of populations.   This was ascertained by the researchers based on the swab results of the kids, which had come out negative. However, their stool still tested positive for the virus, suggesting that a minimal amount of virus might be able to sustain itself for longer inside children. A peculiar case involved a child's stool testing positive 13 days after they were discharged from the hospital. The kid had tested negative for throat/nose swabs twice. This brings into question the protocols in place for isolation. Most institutions suggest 14 days of the quarantine period.  \r\n \r\n\"Quarantine timings are currently assessed through the use of nose or throat swabs; however, these results suggest that gastrointestinal-tract testing may help to provide more accurate assessments of treatment effectiveness and recovery\", the news release said.   \"It's important to understand that viral shedding [in stool samples] seen in this small study does not equate with the transmission,\" Glatter said. \"While children may still shed virus in their stool, we don't know whether they may still be infectious and serve as a reservoir of ongoing transmission.\" Still, \"the report suggests that rectal swab testing may be a more sensitive indicator compared to nasal sampling regarding the effectiveness of treatment and when to end quarantine,\" Glatter added.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/17/133396-untitled-design-3.jpg?itok=PA8bJRPj\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162603", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22396", "source": "scrapy"},

The study has also warned that if the total fertility rate, which means the number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime, remains at 1.6, negative population growth is likely in 2027 with a potential total population of 1.17 billion, which is equivalent to the year 1990, according to media reports.  The World Bank estimated that after 1996, China's fertility rate was lower than 1.6, rising back up to 1.6 in 2013 and 1.62 in 2016.  The report noted that if China could maintain this momentum in growth, China's fertility rate would return to a relatively safe level, the People's Daily reported. The report came after Chinese demographers said China's three-year-old two child policy failed to make any impact on the low birth rate as the number of new-borns dropped by two million last year and the decline was expected to continue. Chinese demographers said that the number of new-borns in 2018, the third year after the country has fully implemented the two-child policy, may have dropped by more than two million and the country's birth population will continue to fall, state-run Global Times reported.  \"Although the national data for the birth of new-borns have not been publicised yet, data revealed by local health departments showed that the number of new-borns in 2018 decreased by at least 15 per cent from the previous year,\" He Yafu, a demographer and author of a book on the impact of China's population policy, was quoted as saying by the paper. \"The birth population in 2017 was 17.23 million. Based on current calculations, the number of new-borns across the nation might drop by more than two million,\" He said. China ended its decades-old one-child policy in 2016 and permitted couples to have two children as the population of elderly rose with declining numbers of young people. In August, the official media said China's rapidly ageing population has touched 241 million, accounting for one-fifth of the over 1.4 billion people in the world's most populous country. Recent reports said China plans to completely abandon the birth control policy to encourage people to have more children. \r\n ", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/2021/01/21/179500-jailed.jpg?itok=n_vqXcrI\" width=\"220\" height=\"173\" alt=\"Jailed\" typeof=\"Image\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162606", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21268", "source": "scrapy"},

The closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders was the Prime Minister’s first such dialogue since 2014, when the subject of wearing the tudung was also raised. “Today we had a candid and sincere discussion, focusing more specifically on tudung for nurses. But, of course, going beyond that too,” said Mr Lee. He thanked them for “walking with the Government on this complex journey” and for helping them to manage an important issue. “We are a multiracial and multireligious country. It's a delicate balance, but we are fully committed to preserving our harmony, and to maintaining our common space,” he said. “We want to avoid creating unintended consequences … when we make well intentioned moves.” Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the dialogue was “constructive and candid” and that the community leaders got to hear what the Government’s position and considerations are. He added that there was a common understanding that this issue must be approached carefully because it involves racial and religious sensitivities. \"Therefore, we cannot rush to a decision. At the heart of the matter is how we strike a good balance in allowing our nurses to put on the tudung with their uniform, so that this decision can win the support of all communities, preserve common space and at the same time strengthen our social cohesion,\" he said. He added that in doing so, the Government hoped it can support the request by nurses to don the tudung with their uniform. “We know, we empathise that they want to lead meaningful religious lives daily, because this is also their religious identity,” said Mr Masagos. “Our racial and religious harmony is precious and the Malay Muslim community will safeguard these together with the rest of Singaporeans. We’ll continue to engage Singaporeans on this matter. “I hope to seek everyone's support as we deliberate on this issue, and work towards an outcome that’s acceptable to all Singaporeans.” Mr Masagos added that the Government has “always empathised” with the request by nurses to put on their tudung with their uniform. “But we have to be very careful, because it is not just about the Muslim request alone. Any move, any change in our society must be (carried) very carefully, because it involves interaction with other people,” he added. He said it is a “whole-of-government” approach and that they are reaching out to “every stakeholder” on this issue. Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam in March signalled a likely change in the Government's stance on nurses wearing the tudung, and said they were consulting the community. MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) had raised the issue in Parliament earlier this year. Mr Masagos answered on Mar 8 that the Government would continue to have discussions and consultations with the community behind closed doors. Mufti Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said on Saturday the tudung issue is about balancing the religious needs of communities. \"For example, in this case, the needs of Muslim nurses who choose to put on the tudung, while maintaining a high level of trust and confidence between communities,\" he said. \"So conversations between Government and community leaders and religious leaders are very important for us to consider the full range of perspectives, as well as context for the considerations involved before moving to shift the policy.\" He said it is very important that they “should not make a move that may undermine” Singapore's social cohesion, but instead to continue to strengthen it and \"enlarge our common spaces\". \"I think due to the hard work of our communities in forging greater trust and confidence, we are in a better position now to move on with such a change, and I hope that we will continue to give the support, working together with the relevant agencies to ensure that this policy shift will only result in a stronger and more united society,\" he said. Madam Rahayu Mohamad, a MUIS council member and former president of the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS), said Muslim women who wish to \"observe their religious prescription\" would welcome the move.  \"The women that we actually talked to are educated and they're well informed, and the reason why they are still in these sectors is because they understand and (understand) very well in terms of the decision and the choices that they're making,\" she said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162609", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48108", "source": "scrapy"},

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming  . BHG Holdings also reported a 40 to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods, to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours.   The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners. Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.  From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020. It stands at 10 per cent now.  Property tax rebates passed on by property owners have dried up. Although retail rent is expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.  Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm. Perhaps it also knows not keeping up risks losing loyal customers to competing malls.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/9068518/1957a42a2a1da80ba693669103d71585/sing-tien-foo-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Sing Tien Foo \">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162609", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "49262", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.rfa.org", "section": "laos", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/jobs-03262021174354.html", "title": "Nepotism ‘Strong in Laos’ as Children of Party Faithful Fill Top Jobs", "author": null, "author_link": "", "published_date": "2021-03-26", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Senior posts in the government of Laos are being given mainly to the children of Party leaders, with seven out of 17 new cabinet members drawn from two famous families alone, in a trend some observers are calling cases of “inherited power,” Lao sources say. The seven, who hold ministry-level positions or top posts in the Supreme Court or National Assembly, are all members of the powerful Siphandone and Phomvihane families, according to a list announced on March 22 by the country’s prime minister, Phankham Viphavanh, who replaces Thongloun Sisoulith—now Party General Secretary—in the post. One member of the Phomvihane family, Santiphab Phomvihane—a son of the late Lao president Kaysone Phomvihane—is now the governor of Savannakhet province, according to Phankham’s list of top Party assignments. “Inheriting power has been a common practice for a long time in Laos. Everybody knows that,” a Lao scholar in Luang Prabang province told RFA in an interview this week. “In order for somebody to climb up the ladder, first and foremost he or she has to have a ‘blood connection,’” he said. “Qualifications are secondary.” “Most children or relatives of prominent Party leaders will inherit their power. This has become a tradition,” said Adison Seumyaem, a Thai expert on Laos at the Institute of Asian Studies in Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University. “In Laos, power inheritance is more visible than it is in Vietnam and China,” he added. China’s so-called “princelings” hold commanding positions in that Communist state, and the club includes President and party chief Xi Jinping. Also speaking to RFA, a Lao government official said however that the members of the new cabinet had risen to their posts based on merit, and not on family connections. “They have been in the Party for a long time, and are very knowledgeable and capable. That’s why most of them are in the cabinet,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Having children of the former revolutionary leaders in the cabinet is good for the development of the country, because they’re well-disciplined and law abiding and are grateful to their parents,” the official added. “Their parents accomplished great things, and now their children will do the same,” he said. “If someone else were appointed minister, he or she might think ‘differently’ or do something different, something that wouldn’t be right,” he added. Many in Laos say they hope the country’s new prime minister and a National Assembly elected in February will make long-needed changes in the governing of the one-party communist state. One businessman in the capital Vientiane told RFA, “[The new prime minister] should do what he said he was going to do—that is, crack down on corruption, drugs, and the illegal trade in logs and wood.” “It’s difficult to crack down on corruption, though,” another Vientiane resident said. “Some officials always ask for kickbacks. Many people complain about this.” “Corruption is still widespread in Laos,” a businesswoman in Pakse city, Champassak province, in southern Laos said. “For example, many state employees at financial departments are all rich and have luxury cars and homes, though their salary is only about 3 million kip [U.S. $300] a month.” “The government should inspect all that,” she said. An employee of the government inspection office in Vientiane meanwhile told RFA that top Party figures in Laos appear to be out of bounds for a closer scrutiny of their wealth. “I have been working in this office for 10 years now, and I have never inspected any top Party or government leaders in the capital. We’ve only inspected low-ranking officials and departments within the administration of the capital,” he said. “In the past, the top leaders declared their assets, but only a small portion, and they hid most of them,” a former Party member agreed. “And the audit agency is not powerful enough to inspect them. So the new government needs to reverse that practice,” he said. Today's elites are the offspring of leaders of the Lao People's Liberation Army, or Pathet Lao, a communist movement organized, equipped, and guided by Vietnam's Communist Party that overthrew the Lao monarchy in 1975.  The Lao People's Revolutionary Party is the only party the landlocked country of 7 million people has ever known. Laos has a history of widespread government corruption, with the Government Inspection Authority (GIA) reporting in early 2020 that the government lost up to $120 million in 2019 to corruption, disciplined 700 state employees, and fired 400 of them. In the previous year, the GIA found 970 were involved in corruption amounting to $107 million. Transparency International reported in January 2021 that Laos’ corruption ranking had worsened, dropping from 130  in 2019 to 134  in 2020 out of 180 countries.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162609", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12929", "source": "scrapy"},

The number of tests should be more than doubled if we are to detect and isolate the hidden cases,\" Mushtuq Hussain, consultant of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told The Daily Star. The positivity rate reported yesterday was 19.81 percent. This high level of positive rate means that there are many more undetected individuals, who are unknowingly spreading the infection, he added.

She was 59. After fighting Covid-19, she had tested negative for it five days ago. However, her condition worsened and she was taken to hospital again. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Abdul Hamid expressed grief and sent heartfelt condolences to Mita Huq's family. \"We will remember her role in popularising Rabindra Sangeet among the masses\", said the President in his message. She was taken to Chhayanaut Sangeet Bidyayatan at 11:00am yesterday for her colleagues and well-wishers to pay their last respects. She was buried next to her father at Keraniganj's Boromonoharia. \"I am shocked,\" said eminent Rabindra Sangeet exponent, Rezwana Chowdhury Bannya. \"This is an irrevocable loss for Rabindra Sangeet. We always kept in touch and her premature demise really hurts me. May she rest in peace.\" Sadi Mohammad, one of the most revered Rabindra Sangeet artistes in the country, said that he saw Mita as his younger sister. \"I have done so many shows with her both at home and abroad… She would visit me whenever she felt better and would be really happy whenever we visited her. I would often cook and take food for her. My heart is filled with sorrow now.\" Renowned Nazrul Sangeet artiste Sujit Mustafa also shared his grief. \"She was a rare talent -- a top tier artiste. There are many singers who can sing commercially today but very few have the calibre of Mita Huq. She wanted to get well and return to music. Unfortunately, this will not happen anymore.\" \"I am at a loss,\" said National Award winning singer-composer Bappa Mazumder. \"It is difficult to accept that Mita di left us.\" Famed classical exponent and guru Asit Dey considers Mita Huq to be an example for the next generation to follow. \"She was an artiste's artiste -- a role model. I have never seen her without a smile on her face. She used to come to our classical music ashor and would listen to music all night, such was her love towards music.\" Noted actor Runa Khan said, \"I lost someone so dear to me. This void is never to be filled. I just pray that she found peace in her passing.\" Her passing is indeed a huge loss to Rabindra Sangeet. The artiste, who had carved her own niche in the art, was unique in her presentation. In both West Bengal and Bangladesh, she was seen as a pioneer with a inimitable style, never likening herself to anyone else's pattern. Born into a musical family, the noted artiste received her training from maestros such as the late Wahidul Huq, Sanjida Khatun and Ustad Mohammad Hossain Khan. She was a regular performer in the Bangladesh TV and radio since 1977. She participated in the Berlin International Youth Festival in 1974, and since then, travelled all over the world for performances. The singer rose to prominence in the 90's with her first album \"Amar Mon Mane Na\". With her mellifluous voice, she won over the hearts of all Bangladeshi listeners. She voiced over 200 albums throughout her illustrious career. Mita Huq was also the founder director and teacher of the Music Training and Performance Group -- Surtirtha -- and served as the head of the department of Rabindra Sangeet at Chhayanaut Institute in Dhaka. She was also the former general secretary and incumbent vice-president of the Rabindra Sangeet Shommelon Parishad. In 2017, she and writer Hayat Mamud received the Rabindra Puraskar from Bangla Academy. The legendary artiste was awarded the coveted Ekushey Padak in 2020 for her contributions to music. She was outspoken about the divisiveness, moral corruption and violence in a world where Tagore had spoken of unconditional peace and urged everyone to be kinder to one another. For the last five years,  Mita Huq had been battling various kidney-related diseases and underwent dialysis. The singer was married to actor-director Khaled Khan, who passed away in December 2013. Farhin Khan Joyita, a renowned singer, is their only daughter.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-6\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/2021/04/12/mita-hoq.jpg?itok=VVLFzJDX&amp;c=29223f11a4d920b900224e2d6bfdfc69\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "18185", "source": "scrapy"},

Pastor Sithon Thippavong, 34, began preaching Christianity to villagers in Savannaket’s Xonnaboury district in 2011 and was arrested on March 15, 2020 for organizing religious services without authorities’ permission. “The court is going to try Pastor Sithon next week. Everyone is waiting to see whether he will be found guilty or not,” a Christian living in Xonnaboury told RFA’s Lao Service this week, requesting anonymity for reasons of safety. A close friend of the Christian leader meanwhile voiced concern for the pastor and his wife and children, adding, “He is a good person, and we would like to see this matter solved with due process and justice.\" Speaking to RFA on March 25, Phil Robertson—Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch for the Asia-Pacific Region—called Sithon’s continued detention a “serious human rights violation.” “In fact, the Lao authorities should release Pastor Sithon and apologize for arresting and detaining him,” Robertson said. “In general, the authorities should not violate the rights and freedom of those who believe in religion.” Bounthone Chanthalavong-Weise, president of the Germany-based Alliance for Democracy in Laos, said that her group on March 18 reported Sithon’s arrest and “other violations of human rights in the Lao PDR [People’s Democratic Republic] to the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.” “We have asked that agency to pressure the Lao government to release the pastor,” Bounthone said. “We are deeply concerned for the welfare of Pastor Thippavong,” added Eric Blievernicht, Operations Manager for the U.S.-based Christian organization Vision Beyond Borders. “We are also disturbed by his extra-judicial  imprisonment by the Lao government, and are concerned he is not being treated well or fairly by his jailers.” “We ask for prayers for Pastor Thippavong and call upon the Lao government to release him and respect religious liberty for all its citizens,” he said. The Lao Evangelical Church in the capital Vientiane also voiced concern, asking its followers in Savannakhet to “closely follow the case.” Reached for comment, an official at the Savannakhet Province Prosecutor’s Office said that Sithon had been accused of undermining social and cultural “unity” by his preaching, adding, “Our office has received all necessary documents and is still in the process of sending the case to court.” The Law on the Evangelical Church, approved and signed into law in Laos on Dec. 19, 2019, allows Lao Christians the right to conduct service and preach throughout the country and to maintain contacts with believers in other countries. But in practice, the law seems to apply only in the capital Vientiane and in other large cities, while Christians in the rural areas remain subject to disrespect by the general public and discrimination at the hands of local authorities, sources say. Four Lao Christians and three Christian leaders were detained for seven days in 2018 in Nakhanong village in Savannkhet’s Phin district for celebrating Christmas without permission. And in October, authorities in Saravan province’s Ta Oy district, in the country’s south, evicted seven Christians and destroyed their homes when they would not renounce their faith—a clear violation of the law. The Christians then spent two months living rough in the forest, but were allowed to return to their village in December though they have been forbidden from rebuilding their homes. Though improvements in religious freedom conditions were observed in Laos in 2019, cases of abuse were still seen in remote rural areas, the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said in a report released in May 2020.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12417", "source": "scrapy"},

Cases of arbitrary arrest, unlawful killings, and torture in police custody were also reported during the year, the State Department said in its annual report to the U.S. Congress on the human rights record of countries around the world. In Laos, the ruling party’s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued instructions in August warning social media users against posting content or comments criticizing the country’s government, and “articles or comments on articles critical of the government suddenly disappeared from social media sites,” according to the report. Lack of accountability in cases of abuse by police or other officials remained a problem in Laos during the year, the State Department said. “[And] while the government prosecuted officials for corruption, there were no prosecutions of punishments for officials who committed other abuses, and police and security forces committed human rights abuses with impunity.” No new cases of forced disappearance were reported during the year, but no progress was made in uncovering the fate of Sombath Somphone, a prominent Lao civil society leader who was abducted in 2012 after what appeared to be “an orchestrated stop of his vehicle by traffic police in Vientiane.” Notable human rights abuses reported in Cambodia during the year during the year included torture and degrading punishment at government hands, unjustified or arbitrary arrests, and “severe restrictions on political participation,” with at least 40 political prisoners or detainees held in the country as of August, the State Department said. Twenty-three of these were officials or supporters of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which was dissolved by Cambodia’s ruling party-compliant Supreme Court in November 2017, two months after the arrest of CNRP leader Kem Sokha. More than 80 CNRP supporters and activists arrested in 2019 were meanwhile released on bail during the year, but still faced charges and possible re-arrest, the State Department said. Government control of Cambodia’s judiciary saw the country’s Supreme Court on Oct. 27 reject an appeal by former Radio Free Asia reporters Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin, allowing an investigation into charges of espionage against them to proceed, according to the report. “NGOs and observers argued that the case was politically motivated and pointed to the prolonged trial and confiscation of the journalists’ passports as proof of government intimidation of media,” the State Department said. And though prepublication censorship of Cambodian media is forbidden by law, the government “used other means to censor media, most notably through its control of permits and licenses for journalists and media outlets not controlled directly by the government or the [ruling Cambodian People’s Party],” according to the report. “Private media admitted to practicing self-censorship, in part from fear of government reprisal.” In Vietnam, significant abuses continued through the year, the State Department said. Problems included arbitrary arrests, detentions, and killings by the government; “serious restrictions” on free expression, the press, and the internet; and the holding of political prisoners in the country’s jails, according to the report. Restrictions on political participation and a lack of independence of the judiciary were also seen, the State Department said, adding, “The government occasionally took corrective action, including prosecutions against officials who violated the law, but police officers and state officials frequently acted with impunity.” Ministry of Public Security officials reportedly assaulted political prisoners to extract confessions or encouraged fellow prisoners to attack them, and human rights monitoring groups said police regularly used excessive force while on duty, with investigators often torturing detainees. The State Department noted that on Sept. 14, the trial of 29 residents of the Dong Tam commune—the scene of a violent Jan. 9 clash between armed police and commune residents over the government seizure of farmland for military use—ended with convictions, with one Dong Tam resident saying later the 29 had been tortured in custody. Legal scholars, activists, and rights activists later noted “serious irregularities” in the conduct of the trial, which ended with two villagers sentenced to death and others handed lengthy terms in prison. Vietnam’s already low tolerance of dissent meanwhile deteriorated sharply during the year with a spate of arrests of independent journalists, publishers, and Facebook personalities as authorities continued to stifle critics in the run-up to the ruling Communist Party Congress in January 2021. In March, Truong Duy Nhat—an RFA blogger who had been taken back to Vietnam by force from Thailand after applying for U.N. refugee status the year before—was tried and sentenced to a 10-year prison term on charges related to an alleged land-fraud case. And in May and June, independent journalists Pham Chi Thanh, Nguyen Tuong Tuy, and Le Huu Minh Tuan were first detained and then arrested on charges of propagandizing against the state, the State Department said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12841", "source": "scrapy"},

I’d love to find ― eventually find ― someone to share my life with, but if it doesn’t happen, I’ll be just fine. But it would be nice,” the actor added. “Right now, you know what I’m doing? I’m virtually dating. My latest crush is Rip on ‘ ,’” Janney explained. For her part, Barrymore said she didn’t have any new crushes on TV stars these days because she’s spending her time watching “disturbing documentaries” — though she did mention that she’s tried her hand at dating apps, which she’d previously spoken about. “I booked a date with one guy, finally. And then he stood me up at the exact time we were supposed to meet,” Barrymore   in January. “And I was like, ‘Can’t you be a jerk like, an hour before? That would have been such a time saver.’” While acknowledging that getting stood up is an unfortunate side effect of all online dating, the actor said that she “felt so stupid.”  When Glaser tried to say that the man in question who canceled might have just been intimidated by Barrymore’s star power, the actor quickly corrected that narrative.  “No ― I think he’s just an uncourteous person who has reasons that are completely fine to him, but is going about them all the wrong way,” she said. “Screw that Nikki, we gotta face the facts.

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals.

He told the Chief Ministers to strengthen their efforts for the next 2-3 weeks to check the spread of the virus on a “war-footing” and to focus on vaccinations and testing and hold a special drive — ‘vaccine festival’— from April 11 to 14 to cover all eligible beneficiaries over 45. He also asked the states to prevent vaccine wastage.   He defended the eligibility criteria for vaccination amid demand by some states, ruled by Opposition parties, to open the vaccination for all above 18 years. India's criteria is no different from the most prosperous countries in the world, Modi said. States like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Haryana and Chhattisgarh have complained to the Centre regarding the shortage of oxygen, remdesivir and vaccine supply and said the vaccine drive will be severely impacted due to this.  Union health minister Harsh Vardhan dismissed these allegations, saying enough vaccines had been given to the states. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister took the second dose of Covaxin at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, meanwhile, tested positive for Covid-19. He had taken the first dose of the vaccine on March 3.   Addressing the meeting, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said his state has vaccine supply only till Friday, while several vaccine centres in Maharashtra had to be closed for the want of vaccines. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday attacked the Centre for playing politics during the pandemic by giving more vaccines to BJP-ruled states and fewer to non-BJP governed states.  He accused the Centre of giving Maharashtra only 7.5 lakh doses against its demand for 40 lakh vaccines. The minister said the state was aiming to vaccinate five to six lakh people daily to break the chain of transmission.  Tope also held meetings with the manufacturers of Covid-19 drug Remdesivir and asked them to double the production for the state. In order to increase beds for patients, the Pune administration has tied up with the Army Hospital to provide 40 ICU beds.   Health minister Harsh Vardhan said: “The hue and cry by certain states about partisanship by the Union government is just a farce, an attempt to hide their own incompetence. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are two of the top three states based on the allocation of Covid-19 vaccine doses. Both are non-BJP governed states. Let’s put an end to the fear-mongering now! Covid-19 vaccine doses: Total administered: 9 crore plus, in stock/nearing delivery to states: 4.3 crore plus. Where does the question of shortages arise? We’re continuously monitoring and enhancing supply.”  According to him, Maharashtra was given 1.06 crore vaccine doses, Gujarat 1.05 crore and Rajasthan 1.04 crore, while the country’s average distribution was 37.11 lakh.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17035", "source": "scrapy"},

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45259", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54751", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.thedailystar.net", "section": "", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/news/uttara-abduction-its-pre-planned-kidnapping-2076097", "title": "Uttara Abduction: ‘It’s pre-planned kidnapping’", "author": "Home", "author_link": "", "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "The incident of abducting a man and demanding ransom for his release in the capital recently was pre-planned by the arrested elite force members, investigators said. According to the plan, one of the arrestees hired a microbus the day before the incident. After the Rab members negotiated the ransom, they also rented an auto rickshaw to get the money from the victim's family members. Police apprehended two Rab members when they went to pick up the ransom. Yesterday, three witnesses, including the microbus driver and the auto rickshaw driver, made statements before a Dhaka court. The three are: Ayub Ali, 35, driver of the auto rickshaw; Sumon Ali, 33, driver of the microbus in which the victim was kept; and Iqbal Hossain, 52, a distant uncle of the victim. Metropolitan Magistrate Md Atiqul Islam recorded their statements yesterday afternoon, court sources said. On Thursday, police arrested three Rab members and a member of the air force for abducting and torturing Tamzid Hossain, 27, and demanding ransom for his release. The arrestees are: Lance Corporal Dulal Mridha, 32, posted at operations wing of Rab headquarters and allegedly planned and led the abduction; soldier Rokon Mia, 34, of intelligence wing of Rab HQ; Corporal Rony, 26, from the air force; and soldier Md Sagar, 28, of investigation, forensic wing of Rab HQ. Ranu Begum, 45, of Gazipur, was arrested and is on a two-day remand. Police also found involvement of two more Rab members who are on the run. \"We think, it's a pre-planned incident. The Rab member Dulal is known to the air force officer Rony who hired the microbus the day before the incident … Ranu introduced herself as a broker in [garments] business. But we think, she targets people and gets the job done for this group\" said a police official wishing not to be named. In a statement under section 164 of the CRPC before a Dhaka court on Saturday, Tamzid said he was abducted by the elite force members after he went to meet Ranu in the capital's Uttara to discuss starting a business of garment products. He also gave a description of the abduction before the court. He described how he was held inside a vehicle that went around various parts of the city. A source said the victim owed the woman money and she approached one of the four through another man to realise it. On Thursday, the four allegedly picked up Tamzid and demanded money from his family over the phone. Tamzid's family informed police about the abduction and police made the arrests. The next day, the victim's sister Rayana Hossain filed a case with Hatirjheel Police Station. She did not mention the names and designations of the accused. The victim and his family members have left their home on Friday and were staying at an undisclosed location out of fear, police sources said. Police has handed over the three arrested Rab officers to the elite force. Rab Legal and Media Wing Director Commander Khandaker Al Moin told The Daily Star, \"Our special investigation cell has started investigation. The investigators are talking to the arrestees and the witnesses. The investigation cell will prepare a probe report. If it finds them guilty, they will be sent to their main forces for further probe. Based on the probe findings, legal action will be taken against them.\"  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-2\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/feature/images/abduction-2_0.jpg?itok=GqThPRBM\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17574", "source": "scrapy"},

One faction is led by Salahuddin Ahmed alias Salehin, also the present ameer of the JMB. This group has a network in different states of India and its strongholds are in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. The second faction is led by Jahidul Islam Mizan alias Boma Mizan, a top bomb expert of the outfit, and its stronghold is in Bardhaman. And the third one is led by Ezaj Sheikh, an Indian, which mainly has strongholds in different districts of West Bengal.  Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) officials of the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit claimed to have gotten the information of JMB's Indian wing from Rezaul Haque alias Reza, 37. Reza, who was the in-charge of JMB in Bangladesh, was arrested by BDU team from the capital's Badda on Saturday. A Dhaka court yesterday placed Reza on a seven-day remand after SM Raisul Islam, an inspector of CTTC unit, produced him before the court with a 10-day remand prayer in a case filed under the anti-terrorism act with Bhatara Police Station in November last year. Rahmatullah Chowdhury, in-charge of BDU, told The Daily Star yesterday, \"We got some important information about the outfit's Indian part's activities and network details from Reza.\" \"We are now analysing the information to know the outfit's activities in India,\" he added. Salehin went into hiding and took shelter in India after he was snatched from a prison van in February 2014, along with Boma Mizan. After the two fled to India, the outfit's activities speeded up in the country and a new chapter -- Jama'atul Mujahideen India (JMI) -- was declared in 2018, say investigators. But conflicts developed between Salehin and Mizan over procedure. Salehin was busy establishing the outfit's network between Bangladesh and India but Mizan wanted immediate actions. For this reason, in 2017, Mizan formed a separate faction with Indian national Ezaj, said a high official of CTTC unit, quoting Reza as saying. \"Mizan and Ezaj, however, formed separate factions after Mizan started suspecting Ezaj to be an Indian intelligence agent,\" said the official, requesting anonymity. On August 6, 2018, India's Intelligence Bureau and elite anti-terror probe body, National Investigation Agency, arrested Mizan from Bengaluru. The CTTC official in Bangladesh said they believed Ezaj was also arrested by Indian law enforcers, but did not get any confirmation. \"We are now trying to find out who is leading the factions of Ezaj and Mizan in their absence,\" the official told this newspaper. Of the three factions, Salehin's group is the strongest in India and it has supporters in most states of the country, the official said, quoting Reza as saying. JMB leaders Soleman, Firoz, Tareq and Jamai were mainly working for Salehin's faction in India and spreading the network, said investigators. However, Soleman and Jamai are believed to be in Indian jails, following their arrest by Indian law enforcers. There has been no trace of Firoz and Tareq for a long time, they said, based on the outfit's international communication details. Reza told investigators that Salehin has been staying in isolation for this reason for a long time and he has no connection with other leaders of the outfit in India now. \"We have learnt that Salehin did not take any financial support from Bangladesh to operate the outfit's activities in India. We are now trying to find out from where and how money is going to JMI,\" said another CTTC official. Rahmatullah, also the additional deputy commissioner of CTTC unit, said they were trying to find out details of JMB's network between Bangladesh and India.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-6\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_6/public/feature/images/2021/04/10/reza.jpg?itok=EXVZboWa&amp;c=22b6bde8a0b456b75f27ae1fe3213fa5\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162611", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17806", "source": "scrapy"},

Photo: Reuters", "text": "After suffering for more than a year since March 2020, when we were just about to have some respite following the decline in infection and death rates, the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has returned with greater vengeance. With the virus spreading fast, uncertainty is looming large. And the concerns are compounded by the inadequacy of health infrastructure and economic opportunities. There is uncertainty about health and treatment. Uncertainty also prevails in case of livelihoods, income and overall economic situation of the country. Bangladesh economy, like the global economy, is still struggling to recover from the adverse impacts of the pandemic. About two thirds of the fiscal year (FY) 2021 has passed. Economic indicators are not showing much promise. A number of macroeconomic and sectoral indicators have performed below the expected level compared to a normal year. We were happy to see that Bangladesh economy had done far better than other countries in FY 2020 in terms of economic growth. And after about halfway through FY 2021, we started to discuss whether the economy is on its way towards a recovery and what strategies should be taken to make the recovery happen for all sectors. Unfortunately, that discussion for the time being has taken a back seat as the world is once again struggling to deal with the health crisis. After a somewhat relaxed lockdown for seven days from April 5, the government now plans a week-long stricter lockdown from April 14. In view of the sufferings of the people and consequences for the economy of the lockdown in 2020, the government has been mindful this time and is taking steps in a measured way. While the health crisis seems to be unstoppable, the economic crisis is no less serious. Indeed, the government had to undertake a large amount of expenditures in 2020 due to the outbreak of the pandemic which was unforeseen and unplanned. These were to mitigate the economic losses of the people and the businesses in various sectors. The government announced a number of stimulus packages equivalent to 4.4 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for the large businesses, export-oriented industries, small enterprises, agriculture sector, and social safety net programmes. Since the stimulus packages were mostly in the form of liquidity support through commercial banks, the government had also introduced expansionary monetary policy measures to create liquidity for the banks. However, these support measures were not adequate compared to the losses incurred by people. Exports  are yet to rebound, employment has not been regained, and many micro,  small and medium enterprises (MSME) have not received stimulus packages even though the allocation remains undisbursed. As for the poor, allocation under the social safety net programmes has been inadequate and distribution remains flawed. In this context, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) is preparing to chalk out the national budget for FY 2021-22. The task is a daunting one. During the ongoing fiscal year, the MoF had the difficult task to generate additional resources to finance higher government expenditure on the one hand, and utilise those resources efficiently for employment generation without creating inflationary pressure, on the other. Unfortunately, this challenge will continue to exist in the upcoming fiscal year also. This job could be more difficult since the government had limited success in achieving this objective. During July-December of FY2021, growth in revenue collection was 8.6 percent. However, this growth is far too low if the targets have to be met. Thus, in order to meet the target for FY2021, revenue collection has to grow by more than 74 percent during the next six months (January-June 2021). This seems unachievable, if the past records are considered. Growth of income tax has been negative (-) 5.2 percent during July-December of FY2021. So, income tax has to grow by more than 80 percent during the last six months of FY2021. Of course, lower tax collection during the ongoing fiscal year could be due to some tax exemptions to a few sectors in view of the pandemic. But without strengthening institutional capacity of the National Board of Revenue, the revenue mobilisation effort will continue to fall short of the targets even during the post-pandemic period. The other side of the fiscal framework is even more ironical. As opposed to the constrained fiscal space, the government could not also spend whatever was allocated. We have not seen any expansionary fiscal policy even though this was one of the crucial ways to energise the subdued economy. Rather, public expenditure during July-February of FY2021 was lower compared to the pre-pandemic period. The Annual Development Plan (ADP) has been downsized by Tk 7,502 crore in the current fiscal year. The target budget deficit in FY2021 has been set at six percent of GDP. However, till now the trend in fiscal balance indicates lower deficit. As of December 2021, a deficit of Tk 8,408 crore was observed compared to Tk 35,751 crore in December 2020. Lower deficit in fiscal balance is due to a fall in the public expenditure. This is opposite to the suggestions of stimulating domestic demand and strengthening supply response by expansionary fiscal policy. So, the MoF will have to take a more realistic approach in estimating the numbers for the upcoming budget. The need for a stronger fiscal framework is felt more than ever before. While the revenue targets will have to be met for more resources to tackle the fallout from the pandemic, the reform of the tax system should be initiated and continued parallelly. The budget must also make higher allocation in a number of priority sectors such as health, education and skills development, rural infrastructure, and social protection. Sadly, the budget for FY2021 did not see much increase in these areas. For example, despite a pandemic year, allocation for health sector as a share of GDP increased from 0.84 percent in FY2020 to only 0.92 percent in FY2021. The reason for low allocation is often attached to utilisation capacity of resources by the respective ministries. Moreover, despite low allocations, the numbers are revised downwards toward the end of the fiscal year due to the lack of spending capacity. Therefore, the allocation will have to be utilised in an efficient manner. Finally, in order to formulate a \"pandemic budget\" which will plan and implement higher public expenditure targeting larger population and with higher efficiency, the MoF should review the effectiveness of the measures announced in the ongoing budget. The MoF must not focus too much on growth, but on protecting the livelihoods of people and helping the economic sectors and enterprises survive. It does not matter much if we have lower growth in a pandemic year. But what matters is to have a hospital bed for the Covid patient, a job for the youth, cash in people's hand and food to feed themselves and their family. Budgetary measures should be focused towards achieving these objectives.   Dr Fahmida Khatun is the Executive Director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-very-big-1\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/feature/images/2021/04/11/bangladesh-economy-struggling-pandemic.jpg?itok=ku1Y-17V\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162611", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "19423", "source": "scrapy"},

The declarations were made over the official Pakistan radio station, which called on government employees in East Pakistan to return to work. In addition, citizens in Dhaka were warned by the press and radio to take precautions in case there should be an outbreak of cholera. The radio also reported that an army column had advanced unimpeded from Dhaka 70 miles northwest to Pabna. The troops \"did not encounter any subversive or antisocial elements\" on the way, the radio station said. An Indian government spokesman said today that the Pakistani army continued to hold onto major towns and garrisons in East Pakistan, but that it had been forced by frequent ambushes to move down main roads in units of battalion size or larger. Quoting from intelligence reports, the spokesman said although Chittagong was in army hands, the road leading north to Dhaka ran through territory was held by \"insurgents\" who had declared their independence from the western wing. He said the road was disrupted at several points and that ferry operators who had supported the \"insurgents\" had moved vessels away from crossing points. As a result, he said, supplies coming by sea from West Pakistan were being sent up the river to the town of Chandpur for unloading and convoying to Dhaka. \n The Pakistani government announced today that it had received a note from Premier Chou En‐lai of China strongly supporting its efforts to put down a movement for autonomy in East Pakistan. The government said that Chou had denounced the United States, the Soviet Union and India for \"carrying out gross interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan\" and had promised China's support \"should the Indian expansionists dare to launch aggression against Pakistan\". In reporting Chou's statements, the Pakistani government's news agency said that they had come in a letter to President Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan. In his letter, the Chinese premier praised President Yahya, saying \"Your Excellency and the leaders of various quarters in Pakistan have done a lot of useful work to uphold the unification of Pakistan and to prevent it from moving toward a split. \"In our opinion,\" the letter continued, \"the unification of Pakistan and the unity of the people of East and West Pakistan are basic guarantees for Pakistan to attain prosperity and strength. The Chinese government holds that what is happening in Pakistan at present as purely an internal affair of Pakistan which can only be settled by the Pakistani people and which brooks no foreign interference whatever.\" Soviet Premier Kosygin met separately today with the Pakistan and Indian ambassadors as part of an apparently growing Soviet effort to seek a solution to the crisis in East Pakistan. Diplomatic sources said the Soviet Union was deeply concerned over continued bloodshed in East Pakistan and the resulting charges and countercharges between the Pakistan and Indian governments that have led China to speak out on the side of Pakistan. The wide publicity given to the meetings by the Soviet media indicated a Soviet desire to underscore Moscow's effort to remain impartial, even though the Kremlin had already publicly criticised the use of force to quell the East Pakistani independence movement. The United States announced today that it is suspending aid shipments of wheat to East Pakistan because of congestion in East Pakistani ports caused by \"civil strife\" there. The Indian foreign ministry today denied a Pakistani charge that two companies of Indian border security forces had crossed into East Pakistan and the Pakistani army had \"wiped them out\".

The country's population is expected  , and 1.25 billion in 2065, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has said. The study has also warned that if the total fertility rate, which means the number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime, remains at 1.6, negative population growth is likely in 2027 with a potential total population of 1.17 billion, which is equivalent to the year 1990, according to media reports.  The World Bank estimated that after 1996, China's fertility rate was lower than 1.6, rising back up to 1.6 in 2013 and 1.62 in 2016.  The report noted that if China could maintain this momentum in growth, China's fertility rate would return to a relatively safe level, the People's Daily reported. The report came after Chinese demographers said China's three-year-old two child policy failed to make any impact on the low birth rate as the number of new-borns dropped by two million last year and the decline was expected to continue. Chinese demographers said that the number of new-borns in 2018, the third year after the country has fully implemented the two-child policy, may have dropped by more than two million and the country's birth population will continue to fall, state-run Global Times reported.  \"Although the national data for the birth of new-borns have not been publicised yet, data revealed by local health departments showed that the number of new-borns in 2018 decreased by at least 15 per cent from the previous year,\" He Yafu, a demographer and author of a book on the impact of China's population policy, was quoted as saying by the paper. \"The birth population in 2017 was 17.23 million. Based on current calculations, the number of new-borns across the nation might drop by more than two million,\" He said. China ended its decades-old one-child policy in 2016 and permitted couples to have two children as the population of elderly rose with declining numbers of young people. In August, the official media said China's rapidly ageing population has touched 241 million, accounting for one-fifth of the over 1.4 billion people in the world's most populous country. Recent reports said China plans to completely abandon the birth control policy to encourage people to have more children. \r\n ", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/2021/01/21/179500-jailed.jpg?itok=n_vqXcrI\" width=\"220\" height=\"173\" alt=\"Jailed\" typeof=\"Image\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21268", "source": "scrapy"},

The new push against the Hmong—who fought under U.S. advisors against communist forces during the Vietnam War—follows the March 14 publication of an order by authorities in Xaysomboun province barring access by civilians to the forests near Phou Bia, the highest mountain in Laos, an international NGO said at the weekend. Hmong civilians living in the area are now reporting an increase in violence at the hands of government troops, an official of the Brussels-based Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) told RFA in an email on March 28. “As you know, this escalation of violence coincides with a push towards the development of Phou Bia Mountain as both a tourist site and an area of interest to foreign investment,” the UNPO official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The government continues to deny any wrongdoing and refuses access by international observers, even on humanitarian or medical grounds,” RFA’s source said, adding, “We’re deeply concerned that a recent escalation may result in a serious humanitarian and human rights crisis endangering the life of civilians, including women and children. Estimates of development funding planned for Phou Bia Mountain run as high as hundreds of millions of dollars, with foreign investment also now growing tied to industrial expansion in the area, UNPO sources say. The Lao military has long pushed a campaign targeting Hmong in the region in a program of military attacks and forced relocations into government-controlled camps and villages, with repression and the use of force entering “a new phase of severity” in 2016, the UNPO said in a March 25 statement urging an international response to the crisis. “UNPO further urges the government of the Lao PDR [People’s Democratic Republic] to immediately cease any acts of violence against the Hmong people in the area, to grant immediate and unfettered access to the area to impartial international observers, to make measures to protect civilians living in the region and work towards a peaceful resolution of historical disputes,” the group said. Authorities in multi-ethnic Laos have long been wary of opposition among the country’s Hmong ethnic minority, many of whom say they face persecution from the government because of their U.S. ties during the Vietnam War, when thousands of Hmong fought under CIA advisors during the so-called Secret War against communists in Laos. Speaking to RFA on March 26, a leader of ChaoFa—a Hmong group living in a remote area of Xaysomboun and deemed an “anti-government” force by Lao authorities—appealed for United Nations help in protecting his people from attack. “We have been attacked by the Red Lao government since 1975, and on Aug. 21, 2020 a group of about 100 Lao government soldiers launched an assault against us in the Phou Bia area, aiming to kill us all by the end of the year.” “I would like to ask the U.N. to help us as soon as they possibly can,” he said. “The Lao government claims that the Hmong in the Phou Bia area of Xaysomboun province are members of an anti-Lao government group so that the government military can crack down on them,” added a prominent Hmong living in exile in the United States, asking that his name not be used. “Actually they are just ordinary people,” he said. A member of an unidentified group of gunmen was killed last month in a clash with Lao government troops in the latest of a series of sporadic attacks in Xaysomboun by what authorities described as anti-government forces, sources close to the Lao military and police told RFA in an earlier report. The March 9 clash was only the latest in a series of shootings and other attacks in the province, most recently on June 20, 2020 when a government soldier was shot and killed while on patrol inspecting for illegal poppy cultivation. In January 2016, a car carrying Chinese miners was ambushed in the province, leaving two dead and one injured, and in November 2015 an exchange of gunfire between an armed group and local troops left three soldiers and four civilians dead, source said in earlier reports. In most cases, Laos’ secretive government stops short of identifying individuals or groups who might have perpetrated the attacks, and no political statements or claims of responsibility are usually issued in connection with the incidents.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162610", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11902", "source": "scrapy"},

Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a military crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup.   The junta's violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar's myriad ethnic armed groups. The US State Department said it was ordering the departure of \"non-emergency US government employees and their family members\". The decision was taken to protect the safety and security of staff and their families, the State Department said. World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta cadres with sanctions. But the pressure has not swayed the generals. Saturday, the annual Armed Forces Day, saw the biggest loss of life so far, with at least 107 people killed.   The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar's 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions. Three of them -- the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army (AA) -- on Tuesday threatened to join protesters' fight unless the military reined in its crackdown. While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days. A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible.   The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes. Further strikes were launched on Tuesday, but Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU's head of foreign affairs, said the group would continue its position of \"strongly supporting people's movement against (the) military coup\". The KNU's Fifth Brigade put out a statement on Tuesday condemning the air strikes and warning it had no option but to \"confront these serious threats\" posed by the military. Around 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes.   The Thai foreign ministry said late Tuesday about 2,300 have returned to Myanmar, while about 550 remain in Thailand. Karen activists have accused the Thai authorities of pushing people back and accused them of blocking UN refugee officials from the area. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha insisted that there was \"no influx\" of refugees and that the kingdom's authorities had not \"scared them off with guns or sticks\". Some Karen people injured in the weekend strikes sought medical treatment Tuesday on the Thai side of the border -- the most serious case was a 15-year-old with a collapsed lung and broken rib. Thai police said they had intercepted 10 parcels containing 112 grenades and 6,000 rounds of ammunition in northern Chiang Rai province that had been destined for Myanmar's notorious border town Tachileik.   The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Myanmar on Wednesday, requested by former colonial power Britain.

The statement from the Department of Foreign Affairs was the latest shot in an escalating war of words over China’s refusal to vacate Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls Julian Felipe Reef and is within its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ).  “For every day of delay, the Republic of the Philippines will lodge a diplomatic protest,” the DFA said, stressing that China’s ships “blatantly infringe upon Philippine sovereignty.” The department pointed out that the reef is 638 nautical miles from Hainan Island, the nearest Chinese landmass, as the Philippines rejected China’s argument that it is part of their “traditional fishing grounds.”   “Tradition yields to law whether or not it is regarded as traditional fishing,” Manila’s foreign office said, noting that an international tribunal had ruled in favor of the Philippines five years ago.  “The 12 July 2016 Award in the South China Sea arbitration conclusively settled the issue of historic rights and maritime entitlements in the South China Sea,” it said.  “The tribunal ruled that claims to historic rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction that exceed the geographic and substantive limits of maritime entitlements under UNCLOS, are without lawful effect,” the DFA said, referring to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  In a Facebook posting on Saturday, the Chinese Embassy laid claim to territories in the South China Sea and described as “perplexing” remarks by Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana earlier in the day demanding that the ships leave the region. Lorenzana had said 44 Chinese ships were still near the Whitsun Reef and should leave, adding that Beijing’s earlier explanation that the ships were fishing boats sheltering in bad weather was not true. “I am no fool. The weather has been good so far, so they have no other reason to stay there. These vessels should be on their way out,” Lorenzana had said. “The Chinese ambassador has a lot of explaining to do.” In its Facebook post, the Chinese Embassy said the ships were in its territory. “The Niu’e Jiao is part of China’s Nansha Islands. The waters around Niu’e Jiao have been a traditional fishing ground for Chinese fishermen for many years,” the statement said. Niu’e Jiao is the Chinese name for the Whitsun Reef. “The Chinese fishermen have been fishing in the waters for their livelihood every year. It is completely normal for Chinese fishing vessels to fish in the waters and take shelter near the reef during rough sea conditions. Nobody has the right to make wanton remarks on such activities.” The embassy also called on Philippine authorities to “avoid any unprofessional remarks which may further fan irrational emotions.” On Monday, the DFA said it “strongly denounces the Embassy’s attempt to impugn the Secretary of National Defense – a Cabinet Official of the Republic of the Philippines – by calling his statement ‘unprofessional.’” “The Embassy statement contained blatant falsehoods such as claims of adverse weather conditions when there were none and the supposed non-existence of maritime militia vessels in the area,” it said. “The statement also attempted to promote the clearly false narrative of China’s expansive and illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea.”  The West Philippine Sea is how Manila refers to the South China Sea. Chinese Embassy officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Previously, Harry Roque, spokesman for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, had agreed with the Chinese envoy’s statement that Chinese fishing boats were moored in the area because of bad weather. “We hope the weather clears up and in the spirit of friendship we are hoping that their vessels will leave the area,” Roque told reporters on March 25. Since then, Manila has described the Chinese ships’ activity as “swarming” and said that the build-up of Chinese presence in Whitsun Reef and other parts of the Philippine-claimed areas was a navigational hazard.  China claims most of the South China as its own even as six other Asian governments have territorial claims or maritime boundaries that overlap its sweeping claims – Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. While Indonesia does not regard itself as party to the South China Sea dispute, Beijing claims historic rights to parts of that sea overlapping Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162614", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12590", "source": "scrapy"},

By 11am, it rose to 21.65. At 1pm, it was 37.26 and by 3pm, the poll percentage was recorded at 47.42. Polling was peaceful all over the state with the exception of stray incidents or minor violence in some parts. Voters were seen standing in long queues braving the sweltering heat at several polling stations to cast their vote. In Nellore district, a BJP supporter dumped a ballot box in a water tub at Ponugodu village of Anuma Samudram Peta mandal falling under Atmakur assembly segment following a row with the ruling party agents over helping the aged people to reach polling station to cast their votes.   District collector KVN Chakradhar Babu announced the repoll in the village on Friday. Tellagunta villagers of Bogole mandal boycotted the polling to express their protest over not providing drinking water facilities in the village. In Prakasam district, the car of Darsi MLA Maddisetty Venugopal’s brother Ravindra was damaged as he went to Sivaramapuram village in Tallur mandal to see the polling trend. In West Godavari, a voter identified as Seshadri Venkata Durga Prasad was arrested by the Undi police as he tried to pour ink on ballot papers at the 32nd polling station in the village.   In East Godavari, polling was stopped for some time at a polling station located Sakurru village in Amalapuram as the ‘Glass’ symbol of Jana Sena party was not printed on the ballot paper. The problem was rectified and the polling was continued. A retired woman teacher Nrisimhadevara Simhachalam died while waiting for an auto-rickshaw to reach a polling station to cast her vote at Katrenikona. Police booked a case against a voter Kasi Venkata Ramana for taking a selfie with the ballot paper at a polling station at Pallamkurru village in Katrenikona mandal. The election authorities declared his vote as invalid.   In Vizianagaram district, polling was stopped in three stations in Anti Peta polling centre in Seethanagaram mandal as the voters found the name of YSR Congress dummy nominee Senapati Lakshmi in the ballot paper for MPTC polls though the official nominee was Senapati Nirmala. A repoll is likely to be held on Friday. Several adivasis in Visakhapatnam and other places faced a tough time to reach the polling stations for want of proper road connectivity. Hundreds of them crossed Matyasagedda in Arasu mandal to reach the polling stations. In Kurnool, two groups of voters entered into heated arguments at Devanakonda as some of them tried to resort to cross-voting. Police rushed to the spot and restored normalcy.   In Kadapa, at Utpativaripalle of Badvel mandal, YSR Congress supporters acted as agents at a polling station instead of TD activists, forcing the TD nominee Sirisha Reddy and the party agents to stage a protest. TD agents alleged that the signatures on the forms were not theirs. In Rajuvaripeta of Chapadu mandal, YSR Congress activists did not allow a TD agent to sit in the polling station. MPTC nominee Rajeshwari tried to disrupt the polling, forcing the police to take her into custody. In Guntur, TD activists from Gonepudi and Palapadu villages staged a protest in front of Narasaraopeta sub collector’s office, alleging that their polling agents were not being allowed to enter the polling stations by the YSR Congress leaders with the support from CI Krishnaiah.   The villagers from both the villages demanded a repoll and sought suspension of the CI. They alleged rigging of votes by YSR Congress leaders and submitted a representation to the officials.

Now, when they want to return home, no bus service was available as KSRTC staff went on a strike since Wednesday.  Pilgrims have come to Srisailam from 13 districts in Karnataka, like Bijapur, Haveri, Bellari, Gulbarga, Raichur, Bidar, Hubbali, Bangalore, and Tumkur. Kurnool APSRTC regional manager  T Venkata Ramam said about 20 buses were sent on Thursday to Srisailam. There was some problem till afternoon and it was cleared thereafter, he said.   As the ZPTC and MPTC elections are also held on Thursday, we have dispatched 150 buses since Wednesday evening. Once they return on Thursday, they will be pressed into service, he said. “The passengers are brought up to Kurnool and from here they go to their respective destinations taking link services,” he said. A temple official said normally these pilgrims will wait till the Rathotsavam on April 13, Ugadi day. This year, maybe due to the corona scare, they were rushing to go back to their homes after the darshan. Buses from Achampet in Nagarkurnool district were also requisitioned to help the stranded pilgrims, said temple executive officer Rama Rao.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162614", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16306", "source": "scrapy"},

Amidst a national lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery.   On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American's lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US. Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31. He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.   The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country. No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday mid-night, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House will not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban.   I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today, Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden. The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work  and millions more desperate to make ends meet  now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources, he wrote. In his letter, Hawley wrote that the unemployment rate remains at 6.2 per cent  with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis  and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions, he said.   In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers. I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programmes to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm, Hawley added.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162614", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17315", "source": "scrapy"},

Meanwhile, police stepped up their patrols of a remote hillside cemetery after floral offerings began appearing over the weekend on anonymous graves, marking the Ching Ming festival of grave-tending and the honoring of ancestors, Visitors to Sandy Ridge Cemetery, where unclaimed corpses are buried, burned incense and paper offerings, as well as laying fruit, flowers, and other offerings at unmarked graves. Some of the offerings bore the symbols of the 2019 protest movement, which have largely been banned since the CCP's national security law took effect. One of the visitors, Chan Kei-kau, said he was a member of the Protect the Children group of mostly Christian volunteers supporting young protesters in 2019. Chan said he felt the need to honor \"people who died in unknown circumstances.\" Many of the visitors who left offerings at the unmarked graves wore black clothing, a color typically associated by the 2019 protest movement. There was a strong police presence at the cemetery throughout the holiday weekend, and police were taking the ID card numbers of anyone entering the section containing unmarked graves. Police also closed off a nearby intersection and set up roadblocks to ensure that non-residents couldn't enter the area near the cemetery by vehicle, but only on foot. Throughout the 2019 protest movement, reports continued to circulate on social media citing protester disappearances and deaths reported by the authorities as suicide, prompting recurrent rumors that some protesters had lost their lives far from the public eye. Protesters have repeatedly laid wreaths and other tributes outside Prince Edward MTR station following persistent reports that deaths occurred inside when riot police stormed the station on Aug. 31. The selective release of surveillance footage from cameras inside the station by the Mass Transit Rail Corp. did little to assuage public mistrust in the police, who have been repeatedly accused by protesters, medical personnel, and human rights groups of the mistreatment, torture, and sexual abuse of arrestees since protests escalated in early June. In October 2019, dozens of people paid their respects to Chan Yin-lam, a 15-year-old competitive swimmer who was ruled to have died by drowning after her body was found floating in the sea near Tseung Kwan O. Chan Yin-lam had been enrolled on a youth training course at the Hong Kong Design Institute at the time of her death. Police said there were no marks of violence on her body, although it was found naked, and that her death wasn't being treated as suspicious.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162615", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12944", "source": "scrapy"},

Some moments and memories are so special that all it takes is a small sensory cue to take one to a different timeline of one's life. This is often captured by the expression 'madeleine de proust' one of the key passages in Marcel Proust book 'In search of lost time' when a particular sight, smell, food, a song, or an experience unexpectedly unlocks a past recollection. For instance, the smell of jasmine flowers reminds me of my grandmother and how fondly she used to place them near her pillow. It's not uncommon when a simple song triggers a plethora of past memories. No wonder when sometimes I miss my mother near me, I try to do or make something exactly the way she does to intentionally create a madeleine moment and then soak myself in the nostalgia and priceless feelings associated with childhood memories. The reverse is also true. There are events or moments of life thinking about which can make one feel awful. It could be related to anything in the past like the unexpected loss of a loved one, changing dynamics of cherished relationships, emotionally taxing incidents or the struggles in the present moment that instantly makes one negative. Sometimes when a negative situation stays for too long, it can leave one overwhelmed in a way that the person seems to be addicted to negativity or develops a habit of ruminating. For instance, acting as a caregiver where hopes are not high, clinging to a toxic relationship or sticking with the wrong job because of one's helpless condition perceived or real. Rumination is continuously getting lost in a thought loop where you eventually end up thinking about that same negative or sad thought or experience. Why is it that we end up remembering what we want to forget? Perhaps negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that even when an individual has made a conscious thought to not pay heed to it, it keeps coming back. One of the reasons people ruminate is owing to the belief that by ruminating they will probably get an insight into their life or problem. However, it doesn't work out because in a state of ruminating the person is focused more on the problems and consequences instead of solutions. The person may perceive it as natural coping mechanism to adapt with the pain, but one has to ponder whether it's helping one solve a problem or just trapping back in an unhealthy thought cycle. Dwelling on negative thoughts and engaging in self-blame has been associated with mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Research by Peter Kinderman professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they had experienced many negative events in their lives. The question is how to intentionally forget things that only serve to disturb us. Can we exercise influence on our memory? Perhaps the easiest way to forget something is not revisiting it in your mind. There are many theories related to the process of motivated forgetting that suggest that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. According to Freud, memories that are likely to induce guilt, embarrassment, shame or anxiety are actively, but unconsciously, pushed out of consciousness as a form of ego defence. Unconscious or repressed memories are exceedingly difficult to retrieve but remain available. People may resort to 'repression' in which they subconsciously push unpleasant thoughts and feelings into their unconscious as an automatic defensive mechanism. Thought 'suppression' is also a  type of motivated forgetting when an individual consciously attempts to stop thinking about a particular thought. Memories are also forgotten through distortion as perGestalt theory of forgetting. This is also called false memory syndrome in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by false memories, recollections that are factually incorrect but yet are strongly believed. Rehearsing negative memories by ruminating over them only serve to strengthen them, so it's important to forget certain things to live life peacefully. Apparently, we may never forget things completely but when we stop thinking about them, it often fades away as we remember fewer facts. If rumination is affecting your personal growth stop and take notice of the circumstances and triggers that lead you to ruminate. Eliminating the trigger may not be possible always but by practicing mindfulness one can consciously try to respond with an element of awareness breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. This may require consistent practice and conscious efforts but it's important to check yourself lest negativity pulls you into a trap again. Finding a distraction like going for a walk, playing a game, calling a friend, watching a movie or getting engaged in any activity that breaks the chain can also be helpful. If constant rumination is disabling you and you are unable to focus your attention on other important things of life, seeking therapy can be beneficial. Otherwise meditating can also reduce rumination because it helps in de cluttering the mind to arrive at an emotionally calm state. Life is fleeting and made up of a collection of moments. Clinging on to negative experiences will only make us miss out on the beauty of 'now'.Next time if your answer to this question 'Do you remember what you want to forget?' carries away your mind to unpleasant memories and events, change the question itself. Ask yourself - 'Do you forget what you want to remember?' Answering it will not only break the thought cycle and distract your mind but transport you to all the beautiful memories and the blessings in the present moment, that perhaps money can't buy but fills the heart with gratitude.

Returning astronauts to the moon will act as a proving ground before sending them on to Mars, a long-term goal of the Artemis program.  When astronauts explore the lunar south pole, which has never been visited by humans before, they will build on the legacy and science gained during the Apollo program and carry it into a new century.In a statement released by , the proposed spending also calls for an increase of more than 6 percent than the previous year.  \"This USD 24.7 billion funding request demonstrates the Biden Administration's commitment to NASA and its partners who have worked so hard this past year under difficult circumstances and achieved unprecedented success,\" Jurczyk said.  \"The President's discretionary request Strengthens NASA's ability to better understand Earth and how it works as an integrated system, from our oceans to our atmosphere, how it all impacts our daily lives, and how it all is impacted by climate change,\" he added. In addition to aiding the Artemis program and studying climate change, the President's request would also help further the agency's robotic exploration of space, provide a boost to aviation technology and provide new funding for NASA's efforts to engage in STEM outreach for underserved students, according to the agency. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162618", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "33743", "source": "scrapy"},

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162618", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45260", "source": "scrapy"},

By stating he would no longer be head of the fourth-generation (4G) team of leaders in Government, Mr Heng has thrown the question of who will succeed PM Lee wide open yet again. Mr Heng, a career civil servant until he contested in the 2011 General Election (GE), had been chosen as the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) First Assistant Secretary-General in November 2018. In April 2019, he was appointed Singapore’s sole DPM, signifying that there had been a consensus among the 4G team that Mr Heng should lead them and the country. With these developments, Mr Heng, was in all senses, the PM-designate. He was even handed the task of Acting PM in the absence of PM Lee. When he brought his East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) to a slim victory after an 11th hour switch from his stronghold in Tampines GRC in GE2020, some were generous to say that he successfully held off a rout by the Workers’ Party. A second camp argued he had been wounded by his performance and wondered if the party might review his suitability as the nation’s next leader. They might think their instinct was right when Mr Heng said he was stepping aside for a new leader but he has also debunked this perceived link: “The results in the GE2020 performance, in particular, in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside,” he said at the media conference on Thursday. In response to DPM Heng’s announcement, the 4G leaders said in a statement on Thursday “this unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning”. Given that PM Lee also said he would be announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks’ time, the question arises: Why was it not possible to pair the announcements to give the assurance to citizens that there would be, nonetheless, forward momentum in the process of leadership renewal? Since PM Lee said there would be consequential shifts, would those whose political stocks rise – a second DPM, a new Minister for Finance or even a new Defence Minister, for instance, give indication of who the PAP might test as a replacement for Mr Heng. But whose choice would that be? While the two-week interregnum may cause the rumour mills to go into overdrive, can the matter of who the 4G leaders wish to select be settled quite so quickly? Should it? Having said that, if current Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is also Second Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP, were to be placed in the powerful Finance Minister role, it could be taken as a forgone conclusion that Mr Chan is next in line to succeed PM Lee. This would be the fastest way to resolve the succession question. Like Mr Heng, Mr Chan entered Government with the 2011 GE. He has held a few full ministerial portfolios but most unusually, has had a tour of duty outside of mainstream government as the country’s labour chief - Secretary-General at the National Trades Union Congress. He has also been developing his international exposure through a collaborative project between the Government and that of Chongqing province in the People’s Republic of China. His previous incarnation as a Major-General and Chief of Army in the Singapore Armed Forces will have afforded him defence networks in the region and also in the United States where he was the first foreign graduate to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award by the prestigious Army Command and General Staff College. In his current portfolio as Industry and Trade Minister during the pandemic, Minister Chan has worked overtime to secure multilateral trade arrangements and ensure that international trade lines remain open. However, at Thursday’s press conference on Mr Heng’s announcement, Mr Chan and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung - another 4G member touted to be a contender for the premiership - said that the 4G team will need time to consider afresh and “holistically” who might be most suited to be the “captain of the team” using Ong’s preferred metaphor.  In other words, the most obvious choice may not be the answer. What is at stake here? The deleterious public health and economic effects of COVID-19, Mr Heng, explained, would require several years to recede.  PM Lee has also previously acknowledged this while assuring Singaporeans that he will see Singapore through the current crisis and is “determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team”. If he only took over as premier then, Mr Heng would already be in his mid-60s. Sixty-five, we know, is the age when Singapore’s first PM Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to stand down and also two years older than when its second PM, Goh Chok Tong, transferred premiership to the current PM.  This would not have given Mr Heng a long enough runway to govern before the handover to the next leader is expected. This cycle of leadership succession would have started again all too soon. Precious time has been lost to the pandemic since the PM-in-waiting was also limited in his ability to travel overseas to strengthen his standing in the international community. From the disruptions that emanate from US-China relations and the domestic political instability within some of our Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncertainty about how ASEAN can continue to provide ballast for peace, stability and security in the region, which Singapore relies on, is something PM Lee’s successor must be prepared to address.  This person must have a certain level of exposure and experience in operating on that plane. In that regard, the two former Principal Private Secretaries to the current PM, Mr Ong and Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who are on the other hand 51 and 48 years old respectively, may also have some help to draw upon.  They can ride on the networks they have built from that role as well as the tutelage of the current PM - much like Mr Heng could, given that he played the same role to Singapore’s first PM. The advantage might go to Mr Wong, who has built a high and favourable public profile as co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 and clearly has the confidence of DPM Heng, serving as the latter’s Second Minister of Finance since August 2016. If on the other hand, the 4G privileges a leader’s standing domestically and more importantly, his or her ability to motivate to inspire peers and citizens, the people-oriented Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at 44 years of age may be given more time to prove himself. Ironically, this process of readying these individuals and testing the dynamics among the 4G leaders without Mr Heng in the picture will indeed take time. The next PAP Conference and GE may even be needed as barometers of support among cadres and citizens. With PM Lee to provide the firm and steady leadership through the severe and immediate COVID-19 challenge, the best way forward is to take a step back to watch how these candidates continue to interact with Singaporeans, their international counterparts and each other before a new successor is announced.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/10586236/bf96a54634b0637b0f830fbf41a3019f/gillian-koh-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Koh\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162618", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48791", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asian-times.com", "section": "information", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asian-times.com/maharashtra-opens-places-of-religious-worship/", "title": "Maharashtra opens places of religious worship", "author": "Suneet Kaur", "author_link": "https://www.asian-times.com/author/suneetkaur/", "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Maharashtra, which were shut since the imposition of COVID-19 lockdown in March, reopened on Monday with devotees visiting some of the prominent temples and shrines in the state. The reopening of the places of worship in Maharashtra coincided with the Diwali ‘Padwa’, which is an important festival in the state. Early in the morning, devotees were seen visiting Lord Vitthal’s temple at Pandharpur in Satara, Saibaba’s shrine in Shirdi, Goddess Tulja Bhavani’s temple in Osmanabad and the famous Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai. The Siddhivinayak temple’s chairman Aadesh Bandekar on Sunday said only 1,000 devotees will be allowed inside the temple every day in staggered time slots to be booked through a mobile phone application. As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the state government, religious places located out of COVID-19 containment zones have been allowed to reopen as per the timings decided by authorities, and devotees will be allowed inside in a staggered manner. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced reopening of the places of worship, but also cautioned people, saying it cannot be forgotten that the “demon of coronavirus” still persists and called for following discipline. The opposition BJP in the state had been seeking reopening of the places of worship and earlier questioned the Thackeray governments decision to not reopen temples at a time when bars were allowed to reopen. The chief minister, however, had defended his decision saying it was difficult to follow physical distancing at the places of worship. The issue had also led to a stand-off between Thackeray and state Governor B S Koshyari, who reminded the Shiv Sena president of his Hindutva credentials and asked if he had turned secular. Koshyari’s letter to the chief minister was criticised by constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Thackeray had said that after places of worship are reopened, rules and safety protocols have to be followed strictly, and laid stress on wearing masks. “If we follow discipline, we will get God’s blessings,” Thackeray had said. According to the SOPs laid down by the government, only asymptomatic people will be allowed inside places of worship and wearing of face mask is mandatory for devotees. The number of people to be allowed inside such places in a particular time slot will be decided on the size of the structure and ventilation. Devotees will have to maintain social distancing, while management of such places will have to conduct thermal scanning and make available hand wash or sanitisers, according to the SOPs. Local authorities of Maharashtra can further add any directions to these guidelines taking into consideration local conditions. Footwear should be preferably taken off inside vehicles, the guidelines said. Touching of statues, holy books, idols is not allowed and large gatherings continue to remain prohibited. In view of the potential threat of spread of the coronavirus infection, only recorded devotional music should be played, and choir or singing groups are not allowed, as per the SOPs. Among other guidelines, common prayer mats should be avoided and devotees should bring their own prayer mats or pieces of cloth, which they can take back with them. Physical offering of ‘prasad’, distribution or sprinkling of holy water is not allowed. Floors at places of worship should be cleaned multiple times in a day, and community kitchens and ‘langars’ should follow physical distancing, the guidelines said. Effective sanitisation of the premises should be done with a particular focus on lavatories, and hand and foot washing stations. Workers at places of worship will have to undergo pre-joining and weekly COVID-19 tests for highly exposed groups, as per the SOPs.", "image_url": "<img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/937798-shirdi-temple.jpg\" class=\"attachment- size- wp-post-image\" alt=\"Maharashtra\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/937798-shirdi-temple.jpg 1280w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/937798-shirdi-temple-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/937798-shirdi-temple-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/937798-shirdi-temple-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162601", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) hailed Azizbek Ashurov for helping Kyrgyzstan to become the world's first country to end statelessness, working through his organisation Ferghana Valley Lawyers Without Borders (FVLWB). He has helped more than 10,000 people gain Kyrgyz nationality after they became stateless following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the agency said in a statement. \"I cannot stand still when I see an injustice,\" Ashurov said in the statement. \"Statelessness is injustice\". \"A stateless person is not recognised by any state,\" he said. \"They are like ghosts. They exist physically, but they don't exist on paper.\" Ashurov will receive his award at a ceremony in Geneva next Monday. Thanks to his work, around 2,000 children have been handed a right to education, and a future in which they will be free to travel, marry and work, UNHCR said. \"Azizbek Ashurov's story is one of great personal resolve and tenacity,\" UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said in the statement.  \"His commitment to the cause of eradicating statelessness in Kyrgyzstan ... is a compelling example of the power of an individual to inspire and mobilise collective action,\" he added.  Ashurov was motivated by his own family's struggle to achieve Kyrgyz citizenship after arriving from Uzbekistan. During the Soviet era, there were no internal borders, and people moved across Central Asia with only internal documentation. But after the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, \"many people became stranded across newly established borders, often with now-invalid Soviet passports or no means to prove where they were born,\" the UNHCR noted. This left hundreds of thousands of people stateless throughout the region, including in Kyrgyzstan. Statelessness, which affects millions worldwide, leaves people politically and economically marginalised, often discriminated against and particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, according to UNHCR. In the former Soviet Union, women were disproportionately affected by the problem, since they had been more likely to move to marry. And due to hereditary citizenship laws, their statelessness was passed on to their children, UNHCR said. Ashurov helped found Ferghana Valley Lawyers Without Borders (FVLWB) in 2003 to provide free legal advice and assistance to stateless and undocumented people in the southern part of the country. He and FVLWB formed mobile legal teams which travelled to remote areas of the south of the country, sometimes on horseback, to find vulnerable and socially marginalised groups. The Nansen prize, awarded annually, is named for Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen, who served as the first High Commissioner for refugees during the failed League of Nations. Last year's winner was South Sudanese doctor Evan Atar Adaha, who runs an overcrowded hospital to service refugees from Blue Nile State.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/02/112022-untitled-design-7.jpg?itok=hxaVFa74\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162618", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21743", "source": "scrapy"},

Although diving for treasures is no longer a necessity for many, some traders are keeping the tradition alive. The history of pearl diving in the UAE goes back to more than 7,000 years ago. A time when UAE pearls travelled to Rome, Venice, Sri Lanka and even to India. United Arab emirate's pearls were one of the most sought-after accessories of the time. Abdullah al-Suwaidi recalls how his family's fortune depended on pearling much before the discovery of oil in the gulf. \"I lived and grew up around my grandfather, who lived off of pearl diving. He taught me a lot about pearl diving because of my continuous stream of questions and requests for more information and stories of adventure. It inspired my imagination.\", said Abdullah al Suwaidi, owner of a pearl farm. With UAE's petroleum exports reaching sixty-six point two billion dollars this year. Commercial pearl trading has become a dying tradition and Suwaidi's farm is the only commercial pearl farm in the United Arab Emirates. Abdullah al Suwaidi, also added that \"It is regrettable that nations that didn't even exist in 1906 (when it came to pearling) are now the biggest producers of pearls in the world, and the Gulf states, including the UAE, do not contribute (to the trade).\" Back in the hay days, pearl diving offered seasonally if not full-time work for many local Emiratis. Suwaidi managed to keep the tradition alive and still thrills curious tourists by demonstrating how his ancestors would pick oysters off the seabed. Legend has it that once the owner of luxury jewellery brand, Jaques Cartier had travelled to the gulf in pursuit of the world's most precious and exquisite pearls.

The Kospi in Seoul retreated 0.9% to 2,305.18 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 was 0.4% lower at 5,934.70. New Zealand and Singapore also declined. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.2% to 3,310.11, helped by a rebound for tech stocks as the market steadied after its worst drop in four months. The index fell 3.5% on Wednesday on worries an upsurge in coronavirus infections could drag down the economy again. Traders welcomed data that showed the number of US workers applying for unemployment benefits eased last week to 751,000. That was down from the previous week’s 791,000 and better than economists expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, to 26,659.11. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 1.6% to 11,185.59. In Washington, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin listing topics in their stimulus negotiations on which she is awaiting a reply. They include benefits for laid-off workers and measures on coronavirus testing. Also Thursday, the head of the European Central Bank said there’s little doubt it will deliver more stimulus in December. In China, the ruling party said Thursday its next five-year development plan starting next year will emphasize self-reliance in technology. The party gave no details but aid to technology developers could help Chinese makers of smartphones and other products that face possible difficulty in obtaining US components after the Trump administration imposed export restrictions in a fight over security, spying and Beijing’s development plans. Coronavirus case numbers are rising in the United States and Europe, increasing worries that restrictions on business might be reimposed. Retailers worry customers might stay away even if sweeping lockdowns don’t come back. In energy markets, benchmark US crude gained 33 cents to 36.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 1.22 on Thursday to 36.17.

This was the president’s first direct comment on the issue since Philippine government officials said that Chinese militia ships were spotted moored together at Whitsun Reef in the Spratly Islands last month. “We will continue to resolve the issues on Julian Felipe through diplomatic channels and through peaceful means,” Duterte spokesman Harry Roque said, reading a statement from the president that used the Philippine name for Whitsun Reef. “Whatever differences we have with China will not define our bilateral relations.\" “It will not be an obstacle to the overall positive trajectory of our bilateral friendly relations and our deepening cooperation in pandemic response, including vaccine cooperation and in post-pandemic recovery,” he said. Julian Felipe, or Whitsun Reef, is within the Philippines’ 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In recent days, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana has engaged in a war of words with the Chinese Embassy over the ongoing presence of dozens of Chinese ships in the area. After cancelling a news conference, which he had scheduled for Tuesday on the issue, Lorenzana announced he had tested positive for COVID-19 and would be observing quarantine guidelines. On Monday, the Department of Foreign Affairs threatened to file daily diplomatic protests against China until Beijing removed its ships from the Philippine EEZ. In a Facebook post two days earlier, the Chinese Embassy had said the ships were in Beijing’s territory. “The Niu’e Jiao is part of China’s Nansha Islands. The waters around Niu’e Jiao have been a traditional fishing ground for Chinese fishermen for many years,” the statement said. Niu’e Jiao is the Chinese name for the Whitsun Reef. The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to requests from BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service,  for comment on Tuesday. Beijing claims nearly all of the South China Sea as its own while six other Asian governments – Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam – have their own claims overlapping China’s. While Indonesia does not regard itself as party to the South China Sea dispute, Beijing claims historic rights to parts of the sea that overlap Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone. The Philippines began its coronavirus inoculation program in early March, using vaccines donated by a Chinese state-run firm, Sinovac. Doses of British-Swedish AstraZeneca vaccines arrived and have been given out as well.  “China has been giving us everything but never asked anything from us actually,” Duterte had said in February when the Philippines took delivery of 600,000 doses of vaccine developed by Sinovac. The Philippines has received 2.5 million vaccine doses from Sinovac and AstraZeneca and has administered 855,000 vaccinations as of Tuesday, according to a document released by Carlito Galvez, the official who leads the government’s vaccine procurement efforts. Galvez, a former military general, said Chinese vaccines and China’s moves in the South China Sea were separate issues. “The Chinese government is joining us in fighting against COVID-19,” he said. “It’s a fight for humanity. This issue of the West Philippine Sea is separate,” he said, using the Philippine name for the South China Sea. While the Philippines is pushing for China to remove its ships from the region, American navy ships have returned to the South China Sea. A U.S. aircraft carrier strike group entered the waterway on Sunday to carry out maritime strike exercises, anti-submarine operations, coordinated tactical training, and other activities, according to the U.S. Navy. It did not state when the exercises were to end. “It is great to be back in the South China Sea to reassure our allies and partners that we remain committed to freedom of the seas,” said the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group’s commander, Rear Adm. Doug Verissimo. The strike group includes the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, a guided-missile cruiser, and a destroyer squadron. Recent U.S. military maneuvers in the South China Sea have drawn criticism from Beijing. When the same strike group entered the South China Sea in January, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said “it does no good to regional peace and stability for the United States to frequently send military vessels and aircraft to the South China Sea to show off muscles,” BenarNews reported at the time. A month later, the strike group was joined by the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group in carrying out dual-carrier operations in the South China Sea. Other countries have been conducting military maneuvers in the region as well. Canada sent the Halifax-class frigate HMCS Calgary through the South China Sea last week while sailing from Brunei to Vietnam, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported. Meanwhile a Vietnamese frigate conducted combat drills with an anti-submarine helicopter in the Spratly Islands, Vietnamese media reported on Tuesday while not releasing the date of the drills.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162618", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12802", "source": "scrapy"},

In his first public appearance since being handed back to the Hong Kong authorities on March 22 following a seven-month jail term for \"illegally crossing a border,\" Li seemed in good spirits, clad in a white shirt and black-rimmed glasses, documents in hand. Li entered no plea, nor bail application, and was remanded in custody pending trial, with the next court appearance set for May 18. He was represented by barrister Lawrence Law, whose appointment sparked widespread media speculation that he was foisted on Li by the authorities, in a manner similar to methods used by police in mainland China. But Trevor Chan, of the firm Au Yeung, Chan & Ho, denied the firm had been \"assigned\" the case, saying only that Li had asked for such details not to be made public. \"Absolutely not,\" Chan said, when asked if he was a government-appointed lawyer. Li’s sister Beatrice Li has said her brother's defense team wasn't hired by the family. Li was held incommunicado for many days after his return to Hong Kong, and taken to the maximum-security Siu Lam Psychiatric Centre. His family received a message from him earlier this week. Security was extremely tight outside the courtroom, with ranks of police motorcycles and other vehicles escorting the prison van bringing Li to court. The first charge against Li alleges that, between July 1, 2020 and Feb. 15 2021, Li conspired with pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai, his former assistant and U.S. national Mark Simon, and others, to \"request foreign sanctions\" and to \"engage in other hostile activities.\" Li was held in custody in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen for most of the period covered by the charges. Another charge relates to Li's flight -- along with 11 other activists -- by speedboat on Aug. 23, 2020, while a third accuses him of being in possession of \"explosives,\" namely, used tear-gas canisters and other spent police ammunition. Protesters sometimes gathered spent ammunition to keep as evidence of police violence against them during the 2019 movement, which began as a mass public response to plans to allow the extradition of alleged criminal suspects from Hong Kong to mainland China. ' Jimmy Lai was also in court on separate charges on Wednesday, pleading guilty alongside former pro-democracy lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan and former Democratic Party chairman Yeung Sum to \"taking part in an illegal assembly\" on Aug. 31, 2019, at the height of the protest movement. Lee and Yeung were released on bail, while Lai -- who also faces charges under the national security law -- was remanded in custody pending trial. “Today we plead guilty to the charges, but we have done no wrong,\" Lee Cheuk-yan told reporters outside the court. \"This was an act of civil disobedience.\" \"We were affirming ... that we have the right to come out to march,” he said. Yeung said the Public Order Ordinance (POO), which is frequently used to bring criminal charges against peaceful, political protesters, shouldn't have applied on Aug. 31, 2019, as the police had issued a notice of no objection to the planned rally. He cited Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and Article 27 of the city's Basic Law, which state that the residents of Hong Kong enjoy the right to freedom of speech, press and association, and of demonstration. Yeung said the imposition of the national security law and recent changes to Hong Kong's political system by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had abolished democracy in the city.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162619", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12360", "source": "scrapy"},

To strive through such times along with extreme competition is a big task in itself and example of such an accomplishment is  .   was the initial spark blazed by The Tewari Group. The idea of SportVolt was introduced and implemented in the year 2016 by  . The fundamental concept behind SportVolt was to make India a sports superpower. “The aim was to focus on the grassroots level and identify and harness the talent that is currently overlooked’ tells Mr.Tewari. Kshitij was turned down by numerous investors before finally deciding to go ahead with the project based of a small family loan of 500 USD. Chasing the vision and not the money, Kshitij led SportVolt into being a profitable enterprise since the year of its inception with a projected revenue of 3 Million USD in FY20-21 and has already secured a revenue of 1 Million USD in the first two quarter. Under the guidance of his father, Col  , an army veteran and a UNESCO awardee, the team then decided to expand operations with the establishment of   an organisation dedicated towards trading and promoting locally made products. “We wanted to take the same sentiment and work ethic and leverage our grassroots network to identify and promote industries with local ownerships” states Mr. Raghav Sharma, Director at RushKash. Both ventures soon saw various additions came in their respective portfolios. SportVolt entered the healthcare, manpower and capacity building sectors. ‘With a core competency in personnel training, manpower and capacity building seemed like an obvious choice, and being involved with sports and wellness, healthcare was a sector we always had an inkling towards’ says Kshitij. RushKash has also observed the addition of realty services in its project operations. Kshitij and his team were all set to enter a new phase of expansion with plans to enter the defense sector but due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, those plans were derailed. The team decided to regroup and design a fresh strategy. This led towards the advent of Tewari Enterprises, with Col Prakash Tewari at the helm. In no time   came to fruition and is now moulding its way in GIS and GPS based tech and bulletproofing solutions. “Our aim through the Tewari Group is to consolidate all our operations and have them working in synchronicity and deliver bundled experiences as opposed to a single point deliverable” expresses Col Tewari, who has previously served as the Executive Director – CSR for DLF Ltd, prior to which he had served in identical roles at Jindal Steel and Power and Tata Power Company.

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball.

(AP) — A sixth person has died following a shooting earlier this week at the hands of a former NFL player who also killed four members of a South Carolina family, local officials said Saturday. Robert Shook, 38, an air conditioning technician from Cherryville, North Carolina, has died from injuries sustained in the Wednesday shooting while he was working at the home, according to York County Coroner Sabrina Gast. Authorities say Phillip Adams killed Rock Hill physician Robert Lesslie; his wife, Barbara; two of their grandchildren, 9-year-old Adah Lesslie and 5-year-old Noah Lesslie; and another air conditioning technician, James Lewis, who had been working with Shook at the Lesslie home. Adams later shot himself to death. His brain is now being examined for possible degenerative disease that has been shown to cause violent mood swings and other cognitive disorders in some athletes and members of the military. Adams, 32, played in 78 NFL games over six seasons for six teams. He joined the 49ers in 2010 as a seventh-round draft pick out of South Carolina State, and though he rarely started, he went on to play for New England, Seattle, San Francisco, Oakland and the New York Jets before finishing his career with the Atlanta Falcons in 2015. As a rookie, Adams suffered a severe ankle injury and never played for the 49ers again. Later, with the Raiders, he had two concussions over three games in 2012. Whether he suffered long-lasting concussion-related injuries wasn’t immediately clear. Adams would not have been eligible for testing as part of a broad settlement between the league and former players over such injuries, because he hadn’t retired by 2014.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162619", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "56997", "source": "scrapy"},

A senior doctor of a private hospital, on condition of anonymity, said, they had had 10 such patients. “In three of these cases, the patient’s lungs turned out to be fully white, which means they were filled with virus. This is worrisome,\" the doctor said. Similar cases are being reported from other hospitals too.   There is suspicion that this could be hospital-acquired Covid-19. This is because patients, especially in-patients, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 that is in the hospital for more than two hours, according to a study carried out by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB). While both government and private hospitals have separate pathways for Covid-19 patients, it is worrisome that other patients end up contracting the virus. A senior infection control specialist, who chose to remain anonymous, said, \"These cases are being noted despite our infection control protocols, as the virus movement in the hospital air is high. The other alternative could be that the number of asymptomatic carriers in the public is very high. Contacts of healthcare workers, patient caregivers and family members interact with society, leading to transmission and movement of virus. As immune-compromised are susceptible to virus, they are acquiring it.\"   Hospitals are finding it difficult to explain this challenge to patients who pick up the infection post surgery. Elective surgeries are finalised on various parameters, including when mere medication is no more effective. Patients have no option but opt for surgery. \"Separate pathways in hospitals require extensive care and extremely strong protocols, which healthcare workers have to follow. In the second Coronavirus wave, it is estimated that every fourth person is a carrier of virus. We are approaching a peak. During this time, it is better that patients put off their surgery in case it is not required urgently,\" a senior doctor said.   Similarly, senior citizens and other immune-compromised patients must not be called to hospitals for counselling for fear of them contracting virus in the air. They must be provided online consultation for some time to come. Dr Mustufa Afzal, senior infectious disease specialist at Care Hospitals, said, \"In the second wave, those with comorbid conditions are getting serious within 12 to 24 hours. The spike of virus within the body is immediate, and double mutant is a cause for concern.\" Dr Ashih Chauhan, senior general physician, said, \"Many patients are insisting on hospital admissions when it is not necessary. Trusting your family physician and opting for online consultation is the best way to protect oneself from variants of the virus. Patients panicking only aggravate their situation, as their basic parameters of blood pressures and sugars heighten in such circumstances.\"  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162619", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17186", "source": "scrapy"},

Finding her allegations “completely false, provocative and intemperate” statements, the EC said Ms Banerjee’s attacks and “attempts to berate and vilify the Central paramilitary forces during the electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation among the rank and file of these forces, who have been rendering yeoman’s service since the late 1980s in election after election….”   It also noted that the two-time CM “has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central paramilitary forces… Far more discouraging is the fact that Ms Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other. In fact, Ms Banerjee is sparing no efforts to ensure that a deep wedge and drift is created amongst them which is bound to have serious consequential damage even after the process of elections is over.”   Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in the city on Friday for the poll campaign, tore into the TMC chief over her all-out criticism of the Central forces and the accusations against him. Rejecting her claims, he observed that he had never heard of “a CM of a state or the head of a political party making attacking comments on the Central forces like Ms Banerjee.” Mr Shah urged the TMC chief to apply her “common sense”, reminding her of the “control” of the EC, instead of his ministry, on the Central forces during the polls. He also argued that Ms Banerjee has been “frustrated”, realising that she was facing defeat in the polls, which is reflected in her comments. “She should reply to the notice from the EC to her,” the Union home minister said.   The TMC chief, however, remained defiant despite the massive pressure that is mounting on her since this was the second notice in a gap of 24 hours to her from the EC over her violations of the MCC.  “I will keep talking against the CRPF and BSF as long as they are with the BJP. Otherwise, I will salute them. I respect and salute the jawans of our country. However, I would not do the same to those who are working on the instructions of Mr Shah.

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162619", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45260", "source": "scrapy"},

Driven by state interests, Beijing’s plans for developing Tibet have left Tibetans “alienated and isolated from meaningful development and modernization,” says the report by the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, “Distorted Development: Chinese Discourses on the Right to Development and its Implementation in Tibet.” “The international community has repeatedly condemned the Chinese government for their violations of human rights inside Tibet,” said TCHRD director Tsering Tsomo, speaking at a press conference in Dharamsala on Tuesday to announce the release of the report. “But the Chinese Communist Party has explicitly ignored this by highlighting what it calls the heightened Chinese model of development and infrastructure,” which it says is lifting Tibetans out of poverty in Tibet, Tsomo said. “The Chinese government insists that the economic welfare of the people is their most important right,” Tsomo said, adding, “However, they have threatened all other fundamental rights by making them subordinate to economic rights.” “And the government has also failed to provide any disaggregated data to show the number of Tibetans who are actually benefiting from this development,” she said. China’s development policies in Tibet are designed “to assimilate the region and its people into the framework of a single Chinese national identity rather than to meaningfully improve the lives of Tibetans,” TCHRD says in its report, pointing to the widespread forced removal of Tibetan herders from traditional grazing grounds. “Because China’s development policy has succeeded in urbanizing rural Tibetans and erasing their land rights, it has succeeded in creating pristine wilderness through depopulation, sinicizing economic centres in towns and cities ensuring investments and profits flow back to China Proper,” the rights group says. It has also built infrastructure, including highways and railways, to pull Tibet and its resources “closer to China, extracting natural minerals and resources, and building hydroelectric power to fulfill distant coastal China’s thirst for energy.” Bilingual education schemes that undermine the teaching of the Tibetan language have further disadvantaged Tibetans looking for employment in profitable sectors of the economy, while Tibetan herders forced from their land have been left unprepared for a shift to the modern job market now dominated by Chinese migrants, TCHRD says in its report. Preferential investment by China in Chinese companies in Tibetan urban areas has meanwhile ensured that profits flow out of Tibet and back to China, making Tibet a “remittance economy.” “In the future, as China accelerates and intensified efforts to move Tibetans to urban centres, this will mean a continued pattern of marginalization and alienation from economic opportunities that are already dominated by migrants,” TCHRD sayds. “Tibetans insufficiently prepared for the socioeconomic shift from rural living to the modern job market will continue to be relegated in job opportunities in favor of migrants, and directly marginalized by policy implemented in the name of development.” Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following a failed 1959 national uprising against Chinese rule. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans’ political activities and peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162619", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12475", "source": "scrapy"},

The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer   on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said.   The US Navy said it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state.   The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.”   The MEA added: “The   was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile, the US Seventh Fleet said: “  (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”   It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162619", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17364", "source": "scrapy"},

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three children were among those killed after midnight Friday in the village of Bala in the jihadist-run Idlib region. \"A man, his wife, and their two little girls were among those killed,\" said the head of the Britain-based monitoring group, Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent at a hospital in the area saw the bodies of two of the children wrapped up in thick winter blankets. The strike created a massive crater of rubble near a two-storey home flanked by an empty outdoor swimming pool, the correspondent said. A rescue worker found a stuffed toy cockerel inside the building. Another first responder retrieved two slain rabbits.  The Observatory, which relies on sources inside Syria for its information, says it determines who carried out airstrikes according to flight patterns as well as aircraft and ammunition involved. The Idlib region has witnessed an uptick in violence this week, as the Syrian government presses a deadly offensive despite a ceasefire arranged by its Russian ally and rebel-backer Turkey. Home to three million people, the jihadist-run bastion is made up of a large part of the Idlib province, as well as slivers of the neighbouring Aleppo and Latakia provinces. Idlib is run by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group dominated by Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate. Fighting there since Wednesday has killed 28 civilians including eight children, according to the Observatory. It also took the lives of 58 pro-regime fighters and 67 fighters most of them jihadists, it added. Violence in recent weeks has prompted hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee their homes, exposing them to a harsh winter. On Thursday, Russia denied launching any combat operations in the region since the start of a ceasefire it said went into effect on January 9. According to Turkey, the truce started on Sunday. On Saturday, the Russian army deplored attacks led by HTS, describing them as \"deliberate acts\" designed to \"undermine the ceasefire\", according to Russian news agencies. Turkey's President   has said he would discuss the latest attacks in northwestern Syria on Sunday with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Among those taken into custody are Tibetans suspected of sharing information on the deaths of Chinese soldiers killed in a border clash with India last June in the Galwan Valley of Ladakh, a source in Lhasa told RFA’s Tibetan Service on Monday. “The Chinese government has increased these arrests and crackdowns in Lhasa and in border areas,” RFA’s source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “And those who are suspected of exchanging information regarding the deaths of the Chinese soldiers on the border are immediately arrested.” “They have also deployed more blue-uniformed soldiers in Lhasa and in [Shigatse prefecture’s] Nyalam county,” an area located along the mountainous border with Nepal,” the source said, adding, “and authorities are stepping up their checks on the use of social media in Tibet these days.” Chinese authorities in Tibet maintain tight controls over information flows in the region, arresting Tibetans for sharing news and opinions on social media and for contacting relatives living in exile, sometimes with news of anti-China protests, according to rights groups and other experts. Particular targets of censors and police are images of exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama shared on mobile phones and calls for the preservation of the Tibetan language, now under threat from government orders to establish Chinese as the main language of instruction in Tibetan schools. China does not want reports of conditions inside Tibet to spread outside the country, Tsewang Dorjee, a researcher at the Dharamsala, India-based Tibet Policy Institute, told RFA. And with March 10, observed by Tibetans around the world as National Uprising Day, approaching in just a few days, “the authorities are putting more restrictions in place and cracking down even harder on Tibetans,\" Dorjee said. “And not only in Tibet, but also in China, the government has imposed tighter restrictions all around because there have been more criticisms from citizens on how the Chinese Communist Party handled the border dispute,” he said. “Though India quickly acknowledged the names and numbers of its dead on the border, China did not comment on its own casualties until February 2021,” Dorjee said. China regularly tightens security in Tibet’s regional capital Lhasa and in other Tibetan areas of China during important political gatherings in Beijing and in March, a month of politically sensitive anniversaries. On March 10, 1959, Tibetans in Lhasa rose up in protest of Beijing’s tightening political and military control of the formerly independent Tibet, sparking a rebellion in which thousands were killed. And on March 14, 2008, a riot in Lhasa followed the suppression by Chinese police of four days of peaceful Tibetan protests and led to the destruction of Han Chinese shops in the city and deadly attacks on Han Chinese residents. The riot then sparked a wave of mostly peaceful protests against Chinese rule that spread across Tibet and into Tibetan-populated regions of western Chinese provinces, and hundreds of Tibetans were detained, beaten, or shot as Chinese security forces quelled the protests. Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.

The jawan of 210 CoBRA battalion who was abducted by Maoists after the April 3 Naxal ambush on security forces in Terram on Sukma-Bijapur border in Chhattisgarh’s south Bastar region was handed over to a four-member emissary team, constituted by the Chhattisgarh government to negotiate his release, at an undisclosed location.   The jawan, with his hands tied, was produced before a \"jan adalat\" or kangaroo court of Maoists in the presence of scores of armed rebels, local villagers and mediapersons before being set free at 4 pm.   “The jawan has been released by Maoists. He has reached Basaguda camp (of CRPF),” Bijapur district superintendent of police Kamal Lochan Kashyap said. He was scheduled to be flown to Raipur after his medical checkup, police said. “As soon as we learnt that the jawan was held hostage by Maoists, we contacted eminent people in the region, social activists and mediapersons to secure his release from Maoist custody,” Mr Kashyap said.   Earlier in the morning, the four-member interlocutor team headed by Padma Shri Dharam Pal Jain left for an undisclosed location in the forest on Sukma-Bijapur border to negotiate the release of the jawan with the Maoists. “I was contacted by the government to become an interlocutor to negotiate release of the jawan. I left for the appointed place in the morning along with other members of the team and some media persons to secure release of the jawan. I am happy that Naxals kept their promise to release the jawan if approached by government-appointed emissaries,” Mr Jain said. The other members of the emissary team were local tribal community leader Telam Boraiya, retired teacher Rudra Kere and sarpanch of Surkunda panchayat in Bijapur district, Rukmni Ekka.   With relief writ large on his face, the jawan after his release told reporters, “They (Naxals) treated me well when I was in their custody”. As soon as he was handed over to the emissaries Mr Manhas contacted his family members in Jammu through the cell phone of a journalist present and informed them that he had been set free and was coming home very soon, a journalist who accompanied the delegation told this newspaper from the spot. Sources disclosed to this newspaper that the jawan was spotted by local villagers after the April 3 encounter who handed him to the Maoists. “Maoists had grilled him to extract information on the strength of the security forces deployed in the region and the kinds of weapons they use,” sources said.   Maoist guerillas led by commander of PLGA’s battalion number one Madvi Hidma ambushed a search party of security personnel in Terram area on April 3 killing 22 jawans and injuring 31 others.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162624", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16930", "source": "scrapy"},

Polling was peaceful all over the state with the exception of stray incidents or minor violence in some parts. Voters were seen standing in long queues braving the sweltering heat at several polling stations to cast their vote. In Nellore district, a BJP supporter dumped a ballot box in a water tub at Ponugodu village of Anuma Samudram Peta mandal falling under Atmakur assembly segment following a row with the ruling party agents over helping the aged people to reach polling station to cast their votes.   District collector KVN Chakradhar Babu announced the repoll in the village on Friday. Tellagunta villagers of Bogole mandal boycotted the polling to express their protest over not providing drinking water facilities in the village. In Prakasam district, the car of Darsi MLA Maddisetty Venugopal’s brother Ravindra was damaged as he went to Sivaramapuram village in Tallur mandal to see the polling trend. In West Godavari, a voter identified as Seshadri Venkata Durga Prasad was arrested by the Undi police as he tried to pour ink on ballot papers at the 32nd polling station in the village.   In East Godavari, polling was stopped for some time at a polling station located Sakurru village in Amalapuram as the ‘Glass’ symbol of Jana Sena party was not printed on the ballot paper. The problem was rectified and the polling was continued. A retired woman teacher Nrisimhadevara Simhachalam died while waiting for an auto-rickshaw to reach a polling station to cast her vote at Katrenikona. Police booked a case against a voter Kasi Venkata Ramana for taking a selfie with the ballot paper at a polling station at Pallamkurru village in Katrenikona mandal. The election authorities declared his vote as invalid.   In Vizianagaram district, polling was stopped in three stations in Anti Peta polling centre in Seethanagaram mandal as the voters found the name of YSR Congress dummy nominee Senapati Lakshmi in the ballot paper for MPTC polls though the official nominee was Senapati Nirmala. A repoll is likely to be held on Friday. Several adivasis in Visakhapatnam and other places faced a tough time to reach the polling stations for want of proper road connectivity. Hundreds of them crossed Matyasagedda in Arasu mandal to reach the polling stations. In Kurnool, two groups of voters entered into heated arguments at Devanakonda as some of them tried to resort to cross-voting. Police rushed to the spot and restored normalcy.   In Kadapa, at Utpativaripalle of Badvel mandal, YSR Congress supporters acted as agents at a polling station instead of TD activists, forcing the TD nominee Sirisha Reddy and the party agents to stage a protest. TD agents alleged that the signatures on the forms were not theirs. In Rajuvaripeta of Chapadu mandal, YSR Congress activists did not allow a TD agent to sit in the polling station. MPTC nominee Rajeshwari tried to disrupt the polling, forcing the police to take her into custody. In Guntur, TD activists from Gonepudi and Palapadu villages staged a protest in front of Narasaraopeta sub collector’s office, alleging that their polling agents were not being allowed to enter the polling stations by the YSR Congress leaders with the support from CI Krishnaiah.   The villagers from both the villages demanded a repoll and sought suspension of the CI.

Kunchok Jinpa, aged 51 and a Driru (Chinese, Biru) county resident, had vanished in custody after being detained in November 2013, and died on Feb. 6 in a hospital in Lhasa after being transferred from his prison in critical condition, Tibetan sources and rights groups said. Jinpa had suffered from paralysis and a brain hemorrhage resulting from torture in prison, and was at least the seventh Tibetan political prisoner reported during the last year to have died, either in prison or following release, from injuries inflicted in custody. He had gone to live and study in exile in India in 1989 and returned to Tibet in 1998 to work as a tour guide, and was widely respected in his community, sources told RFA in an earlier report. Jinpa had also been an important source of information for RFA,on protests in Tibet’s restive Driru county, where Chinese police have clamped down for years on communications to stop politically sensitive information from leaving the region. On May 23, 2013, Jinpa called RFA’s live radio show “Round Table Talk” to inform listeners that at least 5,000 Tibetans were protesting mining activities planned by China on a sacred mountain, Naklha Dzambha, where similar protests had been launched two years before. Mining operations in Tibetan regions have led to frequent standoffs with Tibetans who accuse Chinese firms of disrupting sites of spiritual significance and polluting the environment as they extract local wealth for shipment back to China. And on Nov. 13 that same year, Jinpa again called RFA to say that three Tibetans had been arrested in Driru for putting up posters drawing attention to the conditions of Tibetans lives’ under Beijing’s rule and calling for Tibetan freedom. The arrests followed a wave of detentions in the area of Tibetans resisting forced displays of loyalty to the Chinese state, including orders by authorities to fly the Chinese national flag from their homes. Villagers had refused to fly the flags, throwing them instead into a river, prompting a deadly crackdown in October in which security forces fired on protesters in Driru’s Sengthang and Trinring villages, leaving four dead and at least 50 injured, sources said. Suspected by police of contacting RFA and other foreign news outlets, Jinpa was later arrested by Chinese police and sentenced to a 21-year prison term of which he served less than half before his death. Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.

It said the Ambassador Zahairi Baharim went there for the meeting, but the statement did not name Minister of Electricity and Energy Aung Than Oo. He was also seen in the video, which has gone viral on social media and drawn accusations that this showed Malaysia recognized Myanmar’s military regime, which overthrew a democratically elected government two months ago. “The meeting does not construe a recognition or otherwise of the State Administration Council (SAC),” Malaysia’s foreign office said, referring to the junta by its official name. As of Thursday, at least 614 demonstrators had been killed by the military and government security forces across Myanmar since the Feb. 1 coup, according to information compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a Thai NGO. “Malaysia’s position on Myanmar is clear and consistent,” the statement from the foreign ministry said. “We have persistently called for an immediate end to violence, unconditional and immediate release of political detainees, and resumption of an inclusive dialogue involving all concerned parties for a political transition and peaceful settlement of the ongoing crisis in the interest of Myanmar and her people,” it said. The meeting was held to convey a decision by a subsidiary of Petronas, the state-run Malaysian oil company, to suspend a gas project in Myanmar, the statement said. “The decision was made following challenges in the wells’ deliverability that resulted in the production rate dropping below the technical threshold of the offshore gas processing plant,” Petronas said in an April 2 statement. Thursday’s statement from the foreign ministry mirrored comments by Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on March 19, when he called on Myanmar’s military leaders to change course. “Once again, Malaysia repeats our consistent call for all concerned parties to work together towards a peaceful settlement of this crisis. We will continue to support an inclusive dialogue for a political transition, and urge all parties to return to the negotiating table, remedy the crisis, and avoid any further escalation of tensions,” Muhyiddin said at the time. “I am appalled by the persistent use of lethal violence against unarmed civilians which has resulted in a high number of deaths and injuries, as well as suffering across the nation. There is no question about it – the use of live ammunition against peaceful protests is unacceptable,” he said. Muhyiddin also called for Myanmar authorities to unconditionally release political leaders, including civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint, and others who have been detained since their government was overthrown. The junta declared a one-year state of emergency after ousting Suu Kyi’s government, which was democratically elected last November. Malaysian and other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) have joined world leaders calling for peace to be restored in Myanmar and for the unconditional release of Suu Kyi and others. Earlier this week, ASEAN chair Brunei as well as Malaysia announced that a special meeting of top leaders from across the regional bloc would take place in Indonesia to discuss the Myanmar crisis, but a date has yet to be determined. Myanmar is one of the 10 members of ASEAN. The video of Wednesday’s meeting lit up social media in Malaysia. “Does Malaysia recognize SAC Terrorists as legitimate govt? @MuhyiddinYassin,” according to one message posted on Twitter directed at the prime minister. Members of the opposition Pakatan Harapan coalition also criticized the meeting. “The meeting between the Malaysian ambassador and the Myanmar junta army has created a perception that Malaysia has recognized the Myanmar government,” coalition members the People’s Justice Party, Parti Amanah Negara and the Democratic Action Party said in a joint statement. Meanwhile on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced sanctions on Myanma Gems Enterprise, part of the country’s mining ministry, as he called on the Myanmar military and security forces to cease all violence against peaceful protesters. “By imposing targeted sanctions on this entity, we are sending a clear signal to the military that the United States will keep increasing pressure on the regime’s revenue streams until it ceases its violence, releases all those unjustly detained, lifts martial law and the nationwide state of emergency, removes telecommunications restrictions, and restores Burma to the path of democracy,” Blinken said in a statement.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162625", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12680", "source": "scrapy"},

He told the Chief Ministers to strengthen their efforts for the next 2-3 weeks to check the spread of the virus on a “war-footing” and to focus on vaccinations and testing and hold a special drive — ‘vaccine festival’— from April 11 to 14 to cover all eligible beneficiaries over 45. He also asked the states to prevent vaccine wastage.   He defended the eligibility criteria for vaccination amid demand by some states, ruled by Opposition parties, to open the vaccination for all above 18 years. India's criteria is no different from the most prosperous countries in the world, Modi said. States like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Haryana and Chhattisgarh have complained to the Centre regarding the shortage of oxygen, remdesivir and vaccine supply and said the vaccine drive will be severely impacted due to this.  Union health minister Harsh Vardhan dismissed these allegations, saying enough vaccines had been given to the states. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister took the second dose of Covaxin at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, meanwhile, tested positive for Covid-19. He had taken the first dose of the vaccine on March 3.   Addressing the meeting, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said his state has vaccine supply only till Friday, while several vaccine centres in Maharashtra had to be closed for the want of vaccines. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday attacked the Centre for playing politics during the pandemic by giving more vaccines to BJP-ruled states and fewer to non-BJP governed states.  He accused the Centre of giving Maharashtra only 7.5 lakh doses against its demand for 40 lakh vaccines. The minister said the state was aiming to vaccinate five to six lakh people daily to break the chain of transmission.  Tope also held meetings with the manufacturers of Covid-19 drug Remdesivir and asked them to double the production for the state. In order to increase beds for patients, the Pune administration has tied up with the Army Hospital to provide 40 ICU beds.   Health minister Harsh Vardhan said: “The hue and cry by certain states about partisanship by the Union government is just a farce, an attempt to hide their own incompetence. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are two of the top three states based on the allocation of Covid-19 vaccine doses. Both are non-BJP governed states. Let’s put an end to the fear-mongering now! Covid-19 vaccine doses: Total administered: 9 crore plus, in stock/nearing delivery to states: 4.3 crore plus. Where does the question of shortages arise? We’re continuously monitoring and enhancing supply.”  According to him, Maharashtra was given 1.06 crore vaccine doses, Gujarat 1.05 crore and Rajasthan 1.04 crore, while the country’s average distribution was 37.11 lakh.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162625", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17362", "source": "scrapy"},

Growing up, Sahen recalls business channels as screens displaying green and red arrows on which he used to bet on, with his father. He said, “As I grew up, I began learning more about the uses of the financial markets. From my father using financial markets to make his investments, to the companies using these funds for expansion and development. Learning these aspects of Financial markets familiarised me with the sheer amount of power and versatility these markets possessed”. He soon began to find traces of financial markets everywhere that he looked from MNC’s to employees, investment to speculation, DII to FII, saving to economic development; every economic variable relied on financial markets to operate. Claiming to be a turning point in his life, he said, “My friend once told me ‘Yeh Company ke share lele bahut kamayega’ (Buy this share, you will make a lot). At first, I got carried away, but I had my doubts about whether or not it would work. I spent the night researching online and learning more about the suggested company, and by the next morning I realized that this was a dooming opportunity with the business having no future prospects.” I decided to back out on my Investment. Though I was right in the long-run, but my friend did make money in that stock in the short-run… it was that day I understood that the market don’t believe in tit for tat…numbers don’t dictate the stock price…the market sentiment decides. Numbers just tell you which stock to buy, but when to buy is the place where market sentiment walks in. On being asked, What does it take to become a successful wealth manager? He said, “People will say investment strategies, plan, contacts, luck, etc but No…it all comes down to one word ‘Trust’, the trust that I have in my investment suggestion, and the trust that investors have in me. There will be times when things don’t go your way, that’s natural buts that when you have to be there with your investors and face it out… rather than shying away like most of the wealth managers do and losing their trust. NEVER BREAK ANYONE’S TRUST IN LIFE. It takes 30 years to build a reputation and ten minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.” Going forward on the Indian Growth story He said, “I never saw the Indian long-term growth story endangered. Despite, the initial contraction by almost 24% in the first quarter due to covid, we have recovered well to reach the minimal shrink of 7.5% in Quarter 2. Moving ahead, we continue to see huge potential in India in the long run and believe our growth story is intact. And it’s not just I who believe soo… it’s also accepted by others, who are ready to invest in India. We expect the country to witness a ‘V’ shaped recovery post the vaccine roll-out.

The move follows economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and UK at the end of March on other military companies controlled by the junta, and aims to block the flow of revenue supporting junta leaders and military operations in Myanmar that have killed more than 600 civilian protesters to date. “Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Myanma Gems Enterprise (MGE), a Burmese state-owned entity that is responsible for all gemstone activities in Burma,” the Department added in a statement Thursday. “Gemstones are a key economic resource for the Burmese military regime that is violently repressing pro-democracy protests in the country and that is responsible for the ongoing lethal attacks against the people of Burma, including the killing of children,” the Treasury Department said, referring to Myanmar by an earlier name. “These sanctions are not directed at the people of Burma,” the Department said. All property or property interests of MGE in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are now “blocked and must be reported to OFAC,\" the Department said. The U.S. action comes as Myanmar military leaders take part in a large gems emporium held in the capital Naypyidaw under the auspices of MGE, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken added in a statement Thursday announcing the sanctions. By its sixth day, almost $2.5 million worth of jade had already been sold at the event, the state-run   reported on Thursday. The United States will continue to put pressure on the Myanmar junta “until it ceases its violence, releases all those unjustly detained, lifts martial law and the nationwide state of emergency, removes telecommunications restrictions, and restores Burma to the path of democracy,” Blinken said. The U.S. and Britain had earlier leveled economic sanctions in March on two Myanmar military holding companies that also serve as a critical economic lifeline for the junta, designating Myanma Economic Holdings Public Co., Ltd. (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation Limited (MEC). And in July 2019, then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo designated Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing and three other senior Myanmar military generals for travel sanctions for their roles in a 2017 army campaign that killed thousands of Rohingya and drove more than 700,000 of the Muslim ethnic minority into Bangladesh. In 2015, Global Witness—an NGO tracking resource and corruption issues around the world—estimated the value of Myanmar’s jade production at $31 billion. In December, the pre-coup Myanmar government of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy announced the suspension until January of large-scale jade mining activities in Kachin state, home to the world’s largest jade mine and a magnet for poor scavengers, in the face of surging coronavirus infections.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162625", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11928", "source": "scrapy"},

Authorities arrested Paing Takhon, a film actor and popular male model, at his home in Yangon’s North Dagon township at dawn Thursday, with military-run Myawaddy TV saying that he has been charged under Section 505(a) of the Penal Code for spreading dissent against the military. The 24-year-old model had been active in protests against the military dictatorship since soldiers overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government on Feb. 1. His sister, May Chit Thway, wrote on Facebook that police and soldiers arrived in eight trucks to take Paing Takhon from his home. “Please speak out and pray for him,” she wrote in a phrase widely shared on social media by fans. Paing Takhon had written on social media on Wednesday that he hadn’t been well for several days. “I used to pray whenever I worshipped Buddha for good health and to get peace in Myanmar as soon as possible,” he wrote. “Military in Myanmar arrested Paing Takhon, the most handsome person in Southeast Asia,” tweeted Germany-based Indonesian historian and blogger Nadya Karima Melati.  The young star’s arrest came two days after security authorities took away the country’s most famous comedian, Zarganar, in Yangon’s Tamwe township, his colleagues wrote on Facebook. Myanmar authorities have charged dozens of film stars and other celebrities for allegedly supporting the country’s civil disobedience movement and participating in anti-junta protests. Many have fled their homes to avoid arrest. If tried and found guilty under Section 505(a), they could face up to three years in prison. The artists and celebrities have pledged to stand with the people against the military regime that seized power in a coup on Feb. 1, despite the arrests and charges. Earlier in the week, state-run   published lists of people, including actors, musicians, and social media influencers who have been charged with “spreading news to affect state stability.” The State Administration Council, the junta government, issued a warning to media outlets on April 4 not to broadcast films or shows, or to display works of art by those with outstanding arrest warrants. Composer and songwriter Min Chit said that state-run Myanmar Radio and Television (MRTV) informed FM radio stations not to broadcast songs by artists on the list, though many already had asked the stations not to play their songs in a show of solidarity with sympathy for the hundreds killed in protests. “It's good that they have banned them because we don’t want our songs to be on air,” he said. The military imposed similar restrictions on singers and artists after it quelled a popular uprising in 1988, ushering in harsh junta rule that was a dark age for creative people in the country of 54 million people. Well-known cartoonist Maung Maung Fountain told RFA that the cultural icons on the junta’s list fear being treated brutally by the hard men of the military. “It has caused deep scars in the hearts of the artists. I don't think it can be easily forgotten,” he said. “I became a cartoonist because people accepted me, so I keep my fear on one side and carry out the responsibility they gave me on the other side. I’ll keep on doing what I have to do,” he said. Neither Min Chit nor Maung Maung Fountain, who are both in hiding, were on the junta’s list when they spoke with RFA on Tuesday. “The military wants people to love them, to be afraid of them, to respect them, so it will make arrests, torture, or kill the artists,” said a poet in Yangon who declined to give his name. “But most of us will be ready to fight against the evil.” So far, more than 120 have been charged under Section 505(a), a charge often leveled at activists and journalists. Other celebrities on the list include singers Lin Lin and Chit Thu Wai and actors Phway Phway, Eaindra Kyaw Zin, and Pyay Ti Oo. Myanmar beauty queen Han Lay, a contestant in the Miss Grand International pageant in Thailand, asked the international community during the event in late March to help Myanmar regain democracy. “Earlier my protests were about the detention of our leaders, but now I need to protest as an ordinary human being to save the lives of the people, so I decided to ask for help from the global community through the media,” she told RFA in a phone interview on Wednesday. Han Lay said that although she believes that her name is not on the junta’s list, she is afraid to return to Myanmar. “If singers and celebrities can get arrested just for writing posts on social media, how can a person like me, who has come to Thailand to represent the country at a pageant and talk to the international media like this, be safe?” she asked. As Myanmar’s rich and famous joined the more than 2,800 people confirmed to be in detention, protesters in cities across the France-sized country continued to be gunned down for resisting the military takeover. At least 11 people were killed and more than 20 injured in an overnight clash between local residents and junta forces in Taze township in northwest Myanmar’s Sagaing region, where residents denied soldiers entry into the area, witnesses said. “When they began shooting at us, some of our people fired back and held them at bay for about half an hour,” a protester who declined to give his name told RFA. “After that, we retreated into the city, and some more people from nearby villages joined us.” After trying to enter the town, police and soldiers turned to less populated areas and indiscriminately fired weapons as they reached the suburbs, forcing residents to flee to safety, he said. Late Thursday morning, about 50 police and soldiers searched the local monastery, used as a health clinic in the past few days, but they could not make any arrests because protesters had already moved out, Taze residents said. Troops patrolled area streets for the rest of the day, announcing via loudspeakers that any protesters found would be shot, locals said. Authorities also cut off internet connections, making it difficult for residents to get information on the latest situation. Internet access grew worse Thursday with intermittently inaccessible broadband service available on several networks, and authorities in some areas confiscating satellite dishes used to access international news broadcasts, the Associated Press reported. In Sagaing’s Kawlin township, soldiers and police were stationed around the local education office which was razed to the ground around 1 a.m. and burned, residents said. “The fire broke out during the curfew hours,” said a woman who declined to be named. “The day before the fire, a staff member of the office was seen repeatedly taking out what was believed to be important documents. The head of the office had left earlier, two days ago.” Junta forces that have taken over the town of Pinlebu in Sagaing region since Tuesday are checking the cell phones of people they stop on the streets to see if they have sent any images and news videos of the protests to the media, residents said. “A photographer from Kawlin recently was arrested because of this, and they are looking for other such persons,” said a local who declined to be named. Anti-junta demonstrators also held protests in Sagaing’s Kalay township, where a dozen people were killed Wednesday, according to aid workers, as soldiers and police searched streets and houses to arrest demonstrators. Security forces were stationed at the district administration office next to the bus terminal, Taungphila junction, district police headquarters, City Hall, a university, and hospitals, one resident said. “We can no longer travel safely,” the local said. “Although they are everywhere, we will continue our revolution by changing the types of protests.” The military regime issued a statement Wednesday night about the situation in Kalay, saying that dozens of people in the Tahan neighborhood attacked troops clearing the streets, forcing them to strike back. Several security forces were critically injured, according to the junta, though it did not provide a figure. The junta also said that 18 boys had been arrested, but residents said the number could be higher. “We are inquiring about the exact number now,” said one local. “Some ethnic Chin residents were detained for having homemade rifles. Some were students.” About 15 people were injured in Wednesday’s military crackdown, which left a young woman and a man in critical condition with serious injuries, aid workers said. On Mar. 28, police in riot gear stormed a rally in Kalay, starting a weeklong clash between the protesters and the junta’s security forces. As of Wednesday, about 30 protesters in all had been killed since the Feb. 1 coup. In Hpakant township of neighboring Kachin state, seven youths, including two minors, were arrested by soldiers and police Thursday morning just before they began a protest march, after an informer told the police that the boys were holding a meeting in a noodle shop, a protest leader said. “Seven got arrested this morning. They were preparing for a march around 8 a.m. before people could gather at the rally point,” he said. “I only have the names of five and don’t know who the other two were. Among the five were two teenagers, not yet 18.” Since the coup, police have killed two people and arrested nearly 20 others during daily anti-junta rallies in Hpakant. In Myitkyina, capital of Kachin state, security forces who arrived in seven trucks conducted door-to-door inspections Wednesday night in the Sitapu neighborhood, residents said. Despite the presence of soldiers and police throughout the city, a column of young people were able to stage a cat-and-mouse-style lightning protest, they said. Anti-junta protests were held in various forms across the country on Thursday, especially in several townships in Mandalay region, Yangon region, Myitkyina in Kachin state, and the town of Ye in Mon state. A demonstration in Yangon's Kamayut township was dubbed the “marching shoes strike” because dozens of dozens of pairs of shoes with placards and flowers honoring slain protesters were placed on the street in defiance of the military regime. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a Myanmar human rights organization based in Thailand, said that as of Thursday, 614 people had been confirmed killed and 2,857 people were currently under detention by the military regime.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"celeb2.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/star-power-04082021183947.html/celeb2-1.jpg/@@images/4f083a1a-c7a7-4b94-99c0-03fc15410f86.jpeg\" title=\"celeb2.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162628", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "16069", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.dnaindia.com", "section": "contact", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-world-health-day-2021-do-you-know-which-are-the-world-s-healthiest-countries-2021-to-live-in-check-the-full-list-here-spain-portugal-switzerland-japan-iceland-2885194", "title": "Do you know which are the world's healthiest countries to live in?

It also comes as an opportunity for those seeking to make a shift toward healthier living. Well, why not start today! As per World Health Organisation (WHO), this year's  World Health Day theme is 'Building a fairer, healthier world'.  Stating that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the countries hard, WHO mentioned that ours is an unequal world where \"some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income...little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services.\" WHO urged leaders around the world to \"monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.\" And while people across the globe are still struggling to come to terms with how much life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a U.K.-based price comparison website Money.co.uk has come out with a list of the world’s healthiest countries in 2021. The publications release this list every year and this time too it has been published on World Health Day.  The publication mentioned that their mortgage experts rank the healthiest countries and cities in the world on the basis of \"good food, good company and good transport links\". Additionally, conditions like air quality, pollution levels, cost of living, life expectancy among other things are taken into consideration.  Below is the list of the top 5 world's healthiest countries. According to the report, Spain is the healthiest country in the world. It mentioned a few reasons such as their Mediterranean lifestyle, walking as a mode of transport, which helps to lower deaths caused by pollution, cost of living is moderate among other things why the country topped their list.  l: As per the report, Portugal bagged the second spot on the list of the world's healthiest countries. Their high-ranking healthcare system is the reason why the country has achieved good rankings in several health indices over the years, including this one.  Switzerland is home to one of the happiest populations. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum's 2013 Human Capital Report, Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world.  Home to the oldest living population in the world, Japan obviously has one of the highest life expectancies in the world! Other factors that contribute to Japan being in the top five are: their smaller portion sizes and protein-dense diet, their notoriously fast transportation, walking as the preferred mode of transportation and high cost of living matched with the price among other things.   Good healthcare system, healthy diet and clean water among other things such as low levels of smoking, makes Iceland one of the world's healthiest countries to live in. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162624", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34613", "source": "scrapy"},

The building belongs to the French government and is considered French territory, within the premises of which Marcon was filmed admonishing security personnel for trying to follow him into the Church. Officers were accused by Macron for violating rules that prevented them from entering the Crusader-era Church of Saint Anne. \"I don't like what you did in front of me. Go outside, please,\" he warned them in English.  \"Nobody has to provoke. Please respect the rules, they are [in place] for centuries. They will not change with me, I can tell you,\" Macron added during the dispute. A spokeswoman for the Elysée Palace told CNN that the President had intervened after an exchange between Israeli and French security. \"St. Anne belongs to France in Jerusalem. It is up to France to protect these places in this city. The Israeli security forces wanted to enter while security was being provided by French security services. The president reacted to an altercation between the Israeli and French security forces at the time of entering Saint Anne to end it, and to remind everyone of the rules that apply,\" the spokeswoman said. More than 40 world leaders will be visiting Jerusalem including the French President Emmanuel Macron for the fifth World Holocaust Forum being held in the Old City. US Vice President Mike Pence, Britain's Prince Charles, President Vladimir Putin and other dignitaries will be in attendance. Macron is one of many world leaders who are attending the fifth World Holocaust Forum in Jerusalem and dignitaries such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, US Vice President Mike Pence and British Royal Prince Charles are in attendance. Israeli officials state that the visit went according to plan, despite the \"discussion\" between French and Israeli security personnel. \"Based on the terms agreed upon ahead of time, an Israel Security Agency (ISA) guard and a policeman escorted the French president and his delegation inside,\" the joint police and ISA stated. An apology was also issued by the French President once the delegation had concluded its visit to the church, they added; though spokespersons travelling with Macron declined to confirm or deny that statement. Israeli sovereignty over the Old City is not recognized by France as it lies in the eastern part of Jerusalem which the European nation of France regards as occupied territory. Though most of the world shares that characterization, it is disputed by Israel, which considers all of Jerusalem to be its sovereign territory.

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162622", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47696", "source": "scrapy"},

By stating he would no longer be head of the fourth-generation (4G) team of leaders in Government, Mr Heng has thrown the question of who will succeed PM Lee wide open yet again. Mr Heng, a career civil servant until he contested in the 2011 General Election (GE), had been chosen as the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) First Assistant Secretary-General in November 2018. In April 2019, he was appointed Singapore’s sole DPM, signifying that there had been a consensus among the 4G team that Mr Heng should lead them and the country. With these developments, Mr Heng, was in all senses, the PM-designate. He was even handed the task of Acting PM in the absence of PM Lee. When he brought his East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) to a slim victory after an 11th hour switch from his stronghold in Tampines GRC in GE2020, some were generous to say that he successfully held off a rout by the Workers’ Party. A second camp argued he had been wounded by his performance and wondered if the party might review his suitability as the nation’s next leader. They might think their instinct was right when Mr Heng said he was stepping aside for a new leader but he has also debunked this perceived link: “The results in the GE2020 performance, in particular, in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside,” he said at the media conference on Thursday. In response to DPM Heng’s announcement, the 4G leaders said in a statement on Thursday “this unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning”. Given that PM Lee also said he would be announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks’ time, the question arises: Why was it not possible to pair the announcements to give the assurance to citizens that there would be, nonetheless, forward momentum in the process of leadership renewal? Since PM Lee said there would be consequential shifts, would those whose political stocks rise – a second DPM, a new Minister for Finance or even a new Defence Minister, for instance, give indication of who the PAP might test as a replacement for Mr Heng. But whose choice would that be? While the two-week interregnum may cause the rumour mills to go into overdrive, can the matter of who the 4G leaders wish to select be settled quite so quickly? Should it? Having said that, if current Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is also Second Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP, were to be placed in the powerful Finance Minister role, it could be taken as a forgone conclusion that Mr Chan is next in line to succeed PM Lee. This would be the fastest way to resolve the succession question. Like Mr Heng, Mr Chan entered Government with the 2011 GE. He has held a few full ministerial portfolios but most unusually, has had a tour of duty outside of mainstream government as the country’s labour chief - Secretary-General at the National Trades Union Congress. He has also been developing his international exposure through a collaborative project between the Government and that of Chongqing province in the People’s Republic of China. His previous incarnation as a Major-General and Chief of Army in the Singapore Armed Forces will have afforded him defence networks in the region and also in the United States where he was the first foreign graduate to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award by the prestigious Army Command and General Staff College. In his current portfolio as Industry and Trade Minister during the pandemic, Minister Chan has worked overtime to secure multilateral trade arrangements and ensure that international trade lines remain open. However, at Thursday’s press conference on Mr Heng’s announcement, Mr Chan and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung - another 4G member touted to be a contender for the premiership - said that the 4G team will need time to consider afresh and “holistically” who might be most suited to be the “captain of the team” using Ong’s preferred metaphor.  In other words, the most obvious choice may not be the answer. What is at stake here? The deleterious public health and economic effects of COVID-19, Mr Heng, explained, would require several years to recede.  PM Lee has also previously acknowledged this while assuring Singaporeans that he will see Singapore through the current crisis and is “determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team”. If he only took over as premier then, Mr Heng would already be in his mid-60s. Sixty-five, we know, is the age when Singapore’s first PM Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to stand down and also two years older than when its second PM, Goh Chok Tong, transferred premiership to the current PM.  This would not have given Mr Heng a long enough runway to govern before the handover to the next leader is expected. This cycle of leadership succession would have started again all too soon. Precious time has been lost to the pandemic since the PM-in-waiting was also limited in his ability to travel overseas to strengthen his standing in the international community. From the disruptions that emanate from US-China relations and the domestic political instability within some of our Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncertainty about how ASEAN can continue to provide ballast for peace, stability and security in the region, which Singapore relies on, is something PM Lee’s successor must be prepared to address.  This person must have a certain level of exposure and experience in operating on that plane. In that regard, the two former Principal Private Secretaries to the current PM, Mr Ong and Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who are on the other hand 51 and 48 years old respectively, may also have some help to draw upon.  They can ride on the networks they have built from that role as well as the tutelage of the current PM - much like Mr Heng could, given that he played the same role to Singapore’s first PM. The advantage might go to Mr Wong, who has built a high and favourable public profile as co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 and clearly has the confidence of DPM Heng, serving as the latter’s Second Minister of Finance since August 2016. If on the other hand, the 4G privileges a leader’s standing domestically and more importantly, his or her ability to motivate to inspire peers and citizens, the people-oriented Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at 44 years of age may be given more time to prove himself. Ironically, this process of readying these individuals and testing the dynamics among the 4G leaders without Mr Heng in the picture will indeed take time. The next PAP Conference and GE may even be needed as barometers of support among cadres and citizens. With PM Lee to provide the firm and steady leadership through the severe and immediate COVID-19 challenge, the best way forward is to take a step back to watch how these candidates continue to interact with Singaporeans, their international counterparts and each other before a new successor is announced.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/10586236/bf96a54634b0637b0f830fbf41a3019f/gillian-koh-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Koh\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162629", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48791", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asian-times.com", "section": "Sports", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asian-times.com/questioning-messis-future-between-barcelona-disruption/", "title": "Questioning Messi’s future between Barcelona disruption.", "author": "Mahi Sharma", "author_link": "https://www.asian-times.com/author/mahi/", "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Barcelona is on the verge of announcing a new coach, and it may have a new president next year. The club is also promising “wide-ranging” and “profound” structural changes after one of its most humiliating defeats ever the 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals of the Champions League on Friday. The one big question that remains is whether it will be able to keep Lionel Messi. The team’s biggest star for more than a decade has a contract with Barcelona until 2021, but he hasn’t been hiding his dissatisfaction with the club. “I haven’t spoken with Messi but I talked to his father,” Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu told Bar a TV on Tuesday. “Messi is disappointed and frustrated, just like everyone else. It was painful but we have to pick ourselves up. It’s what we all have to do.” Messi has been more outspoken than ever this season, talking about the team’s problems and pointing to poor decisions by club directors. Although he has never really hinted about leaving, his recent actions have raised doubts about his future. “Football is a game that comes and goes very quickly in your life, so this next two years, where he’s still going to have the power to influence games the way he does, is he going to want to be doing that not really competing for the big titles? I don’t know,” former player Rio Ferdinand said. Spanish media has reported that negotiations to extend Messi’s contract beyond next June have been on hold since the problems at the club escalated. One Brazilian outlet, Esporte Interativo, said Messi actually wants to leave now instead of waiting until next year. Rumors of clubs wanting to sign Messi started to surface immediately after the team’s loss to Bayern, with Pep Guardiola-coached Manchester City   among the front-runners. Many think the humiliation against Bayern may have been the tipping point for the Argentina great. Messi looked like he had already given up at halftime, when images showed him sitting at one end of the bench looking down and biting his nails while waiting to go back on the field. Messi and his teammates had to face furious Barcelona fans who confronted them and criticized the team at the club’s training center after the squad returned from Portugal. Messi has been unusually quiet since the loss in Lisbon and hasn’t made any public statements, unlike after the team lost the Spanish league title to Real Madrid a few weeks ago and he came out to openly talk to the media. Earlier this season, Messi criticised Barcelona directors for some of their decisions. He was especially upset with sports director ric Abidal after he criticised players’ efforts amid a series of poor results. Barcelona said Tuesday that the club and Abidal had reached a mutual agreement to part ways. Messi had also said that he didn’t think Barcelona would succeed in the Champions League the way things were at the club. The club is also facing a difficult financial situation because of the coronavirus pandemic, which could make it harder to negotiate with Messi. Still, Bacelona president Josep Bartomeu has always said he expects Messi to finish his career at the club, and that Messi wants the same. The president reiterated that he was confident the playmaker would remain with the club, especially with former Dutch player Ronald Koeman set to become the team’s new coach. “Messi wants to finish his career with Barcelona, he has said it many times,” Bartomeu said. “I spoke with Koeman and he told me that Messi will be the central piece of his project.” The result of next year’s presidential elections will likely play a crucial role in Messi’s decision, and it will also be important whether he is happy with the work of the team’s new coach. The 33-year-old Messi is among the aging players within the squad, along with Gerard Piqu , Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic, Arturo Vidal and Jordi Alba. The youngsters touted as promising stars include Ansu Fati and Riqui Puig, though it’s too early to know how much they will be able to contribute to the first team in the future. After the club announced “profound changes to the first team,” many were wondering what that meant for Messi. Bartomeu was quick to include Messi among the players not up for transfers at the club. “He is the best player in history,” the president said.", "image_url": "<img width=\"268\" height=\"188\" src=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/messi.jpg\" class=\"attachment- size- wp-post-image\" alt=\"Lionel Messi\" loading=\"lazy\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162628", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

It spun a bit and rattled against the court. Surprisingly off-kilter in the early going Saturday, Osaka kept missing shots and digging herself a deficit. Until, suddenly, she lifted her game, and Azarenka couldn’t sustain her start. By the end, Osaka pulled away to a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory for her second US Open championship and third Grand Slam title overall. “For me, I just thought,” said Osaka, who trailed by a set and a break, “it would be very embarrassing to lose this in an under an hour.” This, then, is what she told herself with a white towel draped over her head at a changeover when things looked bleakest: “I just have to try as hard as I can and stop having a really bad attitude.” It worked. A quarter-century had passed since a woman who lost the first set of a US Open final wound up winning: In 1994, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario did it against Steffi Graf. “I wasn’t really thinking about winning. I was just thinking about competing,” Osaka said. “Somehow, I ended up with the trophy.” Osaka is a 22-year-old who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Haitian father; the family moved to the US when she was 3. Osaka, now based in California, arrived for the US Open intent on claiming the championship, to be sure, but with another goal in mind, as well: continuing to be a voice for change by calling attention to racial injustice. She showed up for Saturday’s match wearing a mask with the name of Tamir Rice, a Black 12-year-old boy killed by police in Ohio in 2014. That was the seventh mask she’d used during the tournament, after honoring other Black victims of violence: Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, Trayvon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and Philando Castile. “The point,” Osaka explained, “is to make people start talking.” Last month, Osaka refused to compete after the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in Wisconsin she said she would withdraw from her semifinal at the Western & Southern Open, although decided to play after the tournament took a full day off in solidarity. Osaka and her coach, Wim Fissette who used to work with Azarenka have said they think the off-court activism has helped her energy and mindset in matches. “I wanted,” Osaka said, “more people to (see) more names.” So perhaps it was no coincidence that this win over Azarenka, a 31-year-old from Belarus also seeking a third Grand Slam title but first in 7 years, made Osaka 11-0 since tennis resumed after its hiatus because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Osaka added to her triumphs at the 2018 US Open earned with a brilliant performance in a memorably chaotic and controversial final against Serena Williams and 2019 Australian Open. Azarenka carried an 11-match winning streak of her own into Saturday, including a stirring three-set victory over Williams in the semifinals, stopping the American’s bid for a 24th Grand Slam title. Azarenka won the 2012 and 2013 Australian Opens and lost to Williams in the US Open finals each of those years. “I thought the third time was the charm,” Azarenka said, “but I guess I’ll have to try again.” Even after Osaka surged ahead 4-1 in the third set, the outcome was unclear. Azarenka drew to 4-3, then stood and stretched during the ensuing changeover. “Had a little bit of a energy dip,” Azarenka said. Osaka regained control, then laid down on the court when the final was over. The 23,000-plus seats in the main arena at Flushing Meadows were not entirely unclaimed, just mostly so while fans were not allowed to attend because of the coronavirus pandemic, dozens of people who worked at the tournament attended and the cavernous place was not entirely silent, just mostly so. One of the lucky few in the house: Osaka’s boyfriend, rapper YBN Cordae. “I’m very grateful for the opportunity to play in front of millions of people watching on TV,” Azarenka said. “Unfortunately, they’re not here.” Certainly no thunderous applause or the cacophony of yells that normally would reverberate over and over and over again through the course of a Grand Slam final, accompanying the players’ introductions or preceding the first point or after the greatest of shots. Instead, a polite smattering of claps from several hands marked such moments. Azarenka led early thanks to terrific returning and let-no-ball-by defense, stretching points until Osaka missed. And she repeatedly missed; the first set was over in a blink. Azarenka broke early in the second set, too, to lead 2-0. The question shifted from “Who will win?” to “Might this be the most lopsided US Open final?” Except Osaka made subtle changes that altered the match. She stepped closer to the baseline, redirecting shots more immediately and forcefully. Azarenka began hitting the ball less stridently, making mistakes she avoided earlier.", "image_url": "<img width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816.jpg\" class=\"attachment- size- wp-post-image\" alt=\"naomi osaka\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816.jpg 1440w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162629", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

A few days later, the city was placed under a state-imposed lockdown, limiting the movement and daily lives of its 11 million citizens.  Amid the crisis, the Chinese authorities disrupted the flow of information to and from the city, which was cut off from the rest of the world until now. 61 days after the lockdown was imposed, authorities in Wuhan are making claims that the coronavirus pandemic in the city is buried, ie, that it has reached a zero transmission rate. Workers have been instructed to return to factories, businesses are attempting to reboot, and most travel bans have been lifted. Even though China claims that Wuhan has returned to normal, the country has kept mum about what happened in the city during the two-month long lockdown. Multiple reports and videos clearly showed Chinese authorities dragging citizens out of their homes for testing and containment. Additionally, there has been no acknowledgment of the intense control exercised by China over what information is shared with the world. Amid the global outcry against China for withholding initial information and prosecuting medical officials who tried to warn the world, China now claims that the city of Wuhan has recovered. However, the facts and voices from the ground have a different story to tell.   A video posted by Jennifer Zeng on Twitter claims that hospitals in the country are no longer accepting patients to display a zero-case record. Zeng is a prominent Chinese activist who has ardently recorded Beijing’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. With a state-initiated crackdown on independent reporting, China wants to display to the world their medical prowess. Just last week, China expelled American reporters based in the country. The officials have been attempting to plant conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the virus, one of which claimed that the virus was sent to the country by US army. For now, it’s hard to say what’s really happening in the country. As of figures from today, more than 380,000 cases have been registered worldwide. Additionally, over 16,500 have died.

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162629", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47703", "source": "scrapy"},

It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago.

What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162630", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54751", "source": "scrapy"},

The trader, stationed in the Chinese city of Dandong on the border with North Korea’s Sinuiju, was in charge of selling rare-earth elements mined in North Korea, for use in Chinese manufacturing. At the beginning of the pandemic in Jan. 2020, Pyongyang and Beijing shut down their 880-mile border and suspended all trade and traffic, leaving the man with no way to deliver the ore to China. Sources told RFA the trader was still on the hook for the $1 million even though he now had no way to make the money. “In February, a North Korean trade worker took his life in Dandong. The coronavirus made it so there was no hope of resuming North Korea-China trade. He had no way to meet the foreign currency goals he had been assigned,” a Chinese citizen of Korean descent told RFA’s Korean Service March 27. “He was a skilled businessman who earned a lot of foreign currency by smuggling ore concentrates into China… with an annual assignment of $1 million,” the source said. Ore concentrate from North Korea cannot be legally exported due to international sanctions aimed at depriving Pyongyang of cash and resources that could be funneled into its nuclear and missile programs. “He opened offices in Dandong and Dalian, selling molybdenum and cerium concentrates. He was a member of the Chilsung trading company, which is under Office 39, and he earned more through smuggling than official trade,” said the source. Formally the Central Committee Bureau 39 of the Workers' Party of Korea, the organization charged with procuring funds for Kim Jong Un was set up in the late 1970s under the rule of regime founder Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un’s grandfather. The office has foreign currency-earning agents in many countries, and they are expected to earn money regardless of the economic circumstances. RFA reports from the past year documented how trade officials in charge of North Korean laborers in China were begging to find work for them after opportunities dried up due to the pandemic. The pressure to meet the earnings goal is so high for trade workers sent abroad, and the ore trader had been a valued asset to the regime. “We know that this trade worker was seen as a very loyal trade worker by the authorities. He regularly met his assigned earning goals by smuggling the rare metals, and he also sent a large amount to Pyongyang in loyalty funds each time,” the source said, referring to cash payments demanded by the regime. “But we found out that after coronavirus hit trade, he had been covering the funding assignment by taking out loans from his Chinese counterparts because smuggling ore concentrate was impossible,” said the source. Another source, a Chinese citizen of Korean descent from Dalian, about 171 miles west of Dandong, confirmed the death to RFA. “The other North Korean trade officials are greatly discouraged by his suicide because he had once been a very successful trader,” the second source said. “He was a man in his 50s who specialized in smuggling ore concentrates,” the second source said, confirming that he regularly met his state-assigned foreign currency targets in excess of $1 million each year. “Because such a competent trade worker took his own life due to all the pressure, the North Korean authorities exempted trade workers in China from paying their assignments until the coronavirus situation subsides,” said the second source. RFA reported earlier this month that trade workers in China were temporarily exempt from their currency earning obligations, but at that time it was not known that the ore concentrate smuggler’s death may have been the catalyst. “For nearly a month after the suicide, the authorities in Pyongyang refused to receive the body, saying it was due to the coronavirus. The body could not be buried in the mountains in North Korea, so they cremated it without any documents,” the second source said. “Because the trade worker is a citizen of North Korea, they cannot put his remains in a Chinese columbarium, so they just keep it in a storage room. During his lifetime, he was busy earning foreign currency and gave a lot in loyalty funds, but now they won’t even take his remains and he’s stuck in a storage room in China.” According to another RFA report, North Korean state companies this month began hoarding molybdenum ore. Sources said the hoarding caused a spike in molybdenum prices inside North Korea, and that it could be seen as an indication that trade with China could resume soon. North Korean trade workers dispatched abroad often run afoul of international law when trying to meet their foreign currency targets. Earlier this month, Mun Chol Myong, a trader assigned to earn foreign currency in Malaysia, became the first North Korean national to be extradited to the U.S. He is accused of laundering money through the U.S. financial system as a means to evade sanctions and provide luxury items to North Korean elites. The extradition caused Pyongyang to break off relations with Malaysia, and RFA reported that trade officials in China feared that the diplomats in the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur could face punishment upon their return to North Korea.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162630", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12885", "source": "scrapy"},

At stake is the future of a company which has been at the heart of manufacturing in Britain for more than 100 years, making engines that powered World War Two bombers and still drive the country’s fighter jets and nuclear submarines. Investors are expected to back the rights issue, supporting CEO Warren East’s plan to cut 9,000 jobs and close factories to adjust to a lower level of demand from airline customers that fly with Rolls engines on Boeing 787s and Airbus 350s. Shareholder advisory groups Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have both urged clients to back the fundraising. “We find the terms of the proposed rights issue to be reasonable,” Glass Lewis said in a note, while ISS said the rationale was “compelling”. Investors can buy 10 new shares for every three they own at 32 pence each, a 41% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price. The company, which made a 5.4 billion pound loss in the first half of 2020, faces a cash crunch at the end of next year, when 3.2 billion pounds of debt needs to be repaid. In a sign of Rolls’s strategic importance, the UK government has guaranteed a 1 billion pound loan on top of the 2 billion pounds it backed in July through its UK Export Finance arm. Rolls accounts for 2% of all UK goods exported and is one of the country’s biggest spenders on research and development. It also buys from 2,300 smaller UK suppliers, and before the pandemic supported as many as 135,000 UK jobs. But COVID-19 has shattered the company’s finances because airlines only pay it when their planes fly, forcing it to seek a 5 billion pound debt and equity package to survive many more months of expected turmoil.

However, it coincides with one of the biggest pandemics our societies have witnessed: the novel coronavirus COVID-19. As of figures from today, more than 380,000 cases have been registered worldwide. Additionally, over 16,500 have died. The global tally of the recovered patients so far stands at 100,000. Will the rise in temperatures across the globe mean a dip in the number of infected cases? Many Chinese experts claim that high temperature and humidity can significantly reduce the transmission of the virus. The research was undertaken at Beihang and Tsinghua University in China.   The focus of the study was 100 Chinese cities. The scientists realised that the transmission rate varied across cities with different weather conditions. They realised that as the weather became warmer and humid, the rate of transmission fell. For every degree of rise in temperatures (in Celsius), the rate of transmission fell by 0.0383 points. Similarly, for every one per cent increase in relative humidity, the transmission rate fell by 0.0224 points. Even though an important development, the rise in temperature is simply not enough to slow down the spread of the virus. As it turns out, heat weakens all kinds of viruses. The COVID-19 is capable of living on surfaces for many days.  During its initial period, countries that experience lower temperatures and humidity witnessed severe outbreaks. These include South Korea, Japan, and Iran. On the other hand, warmer countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand were able to contain it much quickly. Another study conducted at the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland took a different approach. The researchers mapped the outbreak in different regions and discovered that the most severe outbreaks happened in countries where the temperature ranged between five and 11 degree Celsius. The virus was found to be clustered in a narrow band of consistently similar weather conditions across the northern hemisphere. This zone included countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, Iran , Italy, France and the US Pacific Northwest. The study has also indicated that the coronavirus could be a seasonal respiratory virus. Both studies point out to the same verdict: the forthcoming summers could bring relief, but would it completely stop the virus? The answer remains no! Many doctors have warned of the virus resurfacing during autumn, and reiterate the importance of maintaining personal hygiene and practicing social distancing.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/02/12/128544-untitled-design-15.jpg?itok=ezHHXif8\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162629", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21824", "source": "scrapy"},

The reason behind this all: the coronavirus pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China. Many researchers and analysts have reiterated that China has displayed grave negligence in handling the virus. Recently, a faction within the Chinese Communist Party has displayed dissatisfaction over Xi Jinping’s response of the virus.   Based on a message circulated on the popular Chinese platform “WeChat”, the bloc was ready for a revolt! The open letter in question calls for a meeting of the politburo to assess Jinping’s performance. The politburo comprises 25 individuals that run the Communist Party. This faction against the Chinese president wants to reflect on \"Xi's wrongs\", and evaluate whether he should carry on as the leader of China. However, challenging his authority is not that simple, for besides being the President of China, he serves as the Chief of the Communist Party. He additionally enjoys support among the political elite in China. The man, who is referred to as the most powerful leader of China since Mao is facing backlash from within his party. Over the last few weeks, China has worked hard to retain its image both globally and at home. Earlier this month, Wuhan’s top party official came up with the idea of a “gratitude education programme”, centred around thanking Xi Jinping and The Communist Party for the efforts they have made to fight the coronavirus. “We must through various channels carry out gratitude education among the citizens of the whole city as well as cadres”, the official had told a local newspaper. The rationale behind this was to extend gratitude to Jinping and to the Communist Party. However, the public reaction to the idea was not very nice. People immediately slammed the idea of this programme, with a local journalist asking the party official to first “educate himself”. To avoid collateral damage, the Chinese authorities covered up the criticism and dropped the idea of the programme itself.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2018/09/11/15469-gettyimages-493919954-20161214052142.jpg?itok=18flu-N7\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162630", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21696", "source": "scrapy"},

He had an indomitable spirit, fighting for peace and justice in the Second World War in his early years, and later steadfastly pursuing environmental causes, where he was well ahead of the times, and taking a close interest in sports and education. His selfless devotion to service has contributed much to advance and uplift the livelihoods of people in the United Kingdom and within the Commonwealth.

Throughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day. We have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh’s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959. The Duke of Edinburgh’s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.

Despite this, Bangladesh has so far done 30 tests per 1,000 people, the lowest even among the South Asian countries. The Maldives has done 1,236 tests per 1,000, according to the ourworldindata.org. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) yesterday reported 5,819 confirmed cases, after testing 29,376 samples. Experts say the number of daily tests should more than double, considering the positivity rate. Otherwise, the \"lockdown\" will not be of much benefit. So far, 68,4756 people tested positive for the virus in Bangladesh. \"The number of daily tests should be raised until the positivity rate falls below 7 or 6 percent. The number of tests should be more than doubled if we are to detect and isolate the hidden cases,\" Mushtuq Hussain, consultant of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), told The Daily Star. The positivity rate reported yesterday was 19.81 percent. This high level of positive rate means that there are many more undetected individuals, who are unknowingly spreading the infection, he added. Among the other South Asian countries, Bhutan is in the second position with 835 tests per 1,000 people, India third with 184, Sri Lanka fourth with 113, Nepal fifth with 79, and Pakistan sixth with 48 tests. United Arab Emirates is on top of the list with 4,022 tests followed by Denmark with 3,954 against per 1,000 people. The USA has done 1,163 tests and the UK 1,912 against per 1,000 people, according to the ourworldindata.org. Bangladesh started witnessing the second spike in daily new cases in the second week of March. The positivity rate rose to 23 percent last week. As of yesterday, the total reported death toll was 9,739, which is 1.42 percent of all confirmed cases in the country. Of those reported dead yesterday, 53 were men and 25 women. One of them was dead by the time she was taken to a hospital. The rest died at different hospitals across the country. Forty-seven of them died in Dhaka and 20 in Chattogram divisions. The demand for ICU beds in the hospitals treating Covid-19 patients was still on the rise yesterday, the DGHS said. At noon yesterday, only three out of 132 ICU beds in the 10 public hospitals for Covid-19 in Dhaka city were available. Of the 2,786 general beds at these hospitals, 311 were available. At the nine private Covid-dedicated hospitals in Dhaka, only seven out of 377 ICU beds were empty. In Chattogram, 25 out of 51 ICU beds were vacant at seven public and private hospitals, according to the DGHS.  ", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-big-2\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_2/public/feature/images/2021/04/12/oxygen-support.jpg?itok=e3THVvLI&amp;c=c28199c96d1ba006ccfd371c53044443\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162612", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17580", "source": "scrapy"},

North Korea publicly claims it is virus free, but it has employed strict measures to prevent the spread of the virus through the country, including locking down cities and counties, cancelling major cultural events, and forbidding travel between provinces. In November 2020, the government upgraded the country’s “emergency quarantine posture,” in place since the beginning of the pandemic, to a policy of “ultra-high-level emergency quarantine measures,” all while telling the international community that it had not confirmed a single case. The purged official was the head of a county-level office of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party in North Pyongan province, in the country’s northwest. Unconfirmed reports of his execution are now making other local officials nervous. “In February, the head of the party organization in Uiju county was purged for the ‘crime’ of having disobeyed the Highest Dignity’s order to maximize the coronavirus emergency quarantine,” a North Pyongan official told RFA’s Korean Service Monday, using an honorific term to refer to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They say he was quietly executed under the direction of the Central Party, but this is not confirmed,” said the source, who requested anonymity for professional reasons. According to the source, the purge came after the Central Committee received an anonymous complaint from another Uiju county official. “The complaint said that the head of the party organization gave orders to reduce the capacity of Uiju’s quarantine facilities for suspected coronavirus patients,” said the source. “The Central Party then dispatched a team to investigate the case, and they found that Uiju’s quarantine facility was not operating properly,” the source said. Uiju county had been under financial stress at the time, and had to make some cutbacks, the source explained. “They had insufficient operating funds. The county’s quarantine authorities proposed to the county party that they would tell patients with mild symptoms to self-isolate in their homes, with the high-fever patients using the quarantine center,” said the source. “They reduced the capacity of the quarantine facility with approval. The official who approved the plan was the head of the county’s party organization,” the source said. Operating the center at reduced capacity went against directives not to be lax with quarantine rules. “They made an example out of him for neglecting the Highest Dignity’s order to maximize public quarantine projects during the prolonged national emergency. It rang an alarm for the officials who are themselves becoming less thorough in implementing the quarantine,” said the source. Another source, also from North Pyongan, confirmed the purge to RFA Tuesday, saying that Uiju’s administrative organizations are in chaos due to anxiety on the part of officials. “After the head of the county party organization was purged, the chairman of the People’s Committee was also dismissed for failing to properly manage the quarantine facility,” said the second source, who requested anonymity for security reasons.   “Officials… believe the purge is the result of a power struggle between party leaders. They wonder why the chief secretary of the Uiju county party, who is in charge of the case, was not punished,” the second source said. Authorities held a lecture session for the officials last week, saying that the party leader’s negligence of the emergency situation was a threat to the nation’s existence, according to the second source. “They again delivered the Highest Dignity’s message that mistakes in economic projects can be corrected, but mistakes in implementing the quarantine should not be tolerated,” the second source said, adding that the increased scrutiny was causing officials to feel more anxious. The second source also said that 10 North Pyongan officials, including military personnel, had been purged between March and May 2020 for violating quarantine guidelines, while in December nine officials and others involved with smuggling at the Chinese border in the country’s northern Ryanggang province were purged for the same reason. RFA reported in December that a smuggler was publicly executed the previous month in the northwestern province of North Pyongan for violating emergency quarantine measures by trying to conduct business with his Chinese partners. Sources in that report said ordinary residents in North Korea’s border region felt that the execution was meant to scare them into not complaining that the emergency quarantine measures affect their livelihood.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162630", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12575", "source": "scrapy"},

In between the freeloaders (guised in the veil of friendship) and the established business firm demanding your services, there is no denying that the come-up of a visual artist is arduous. It is only in the past few years that the industry has gained any real momentum locally. Nonetheless, the question remains:  This creates a dynamic of imbalance between the client and the creator – where the input of the artist is virtually lost. What begins as a pursuit of expressing oneself becomes a slippery slope towards compensating for commercial appeal at the expense of one's own vision. Inevitably, personal projects come to a halt, burnouts occur more frequently and art blocks are omnipresent.

In between the freeloaders (guised in the veil of friendship) and the established business firm demanding your services, there is no denying that the come-up of a visual artist is arduous. It is only in the past few years that the industry has gained any real momentum locally. Nonetheless, the question remains:  This creates a dynamic of imbalance between the client and the creator – where the input of the artist is virtually lost. What begins as a pursuit of expressing oneself becomes a slippery slope towards compensating for commercial appeal at the expense of one's own vision. Inevitably, personal projects come to a halt, burnouts occur more frequently and art blocks are omnipresent.

A senior doctor of a private hospital, on condition of anonymity, said, they had had 10 such patients. “In three of these cases, the patient’s lungs turned out to be fully white, which means they were filled with virus. This is worrisome,\" the doctor said. Similar cases are being reported from other hospitals too.   There is suspicion that this could be hospital-acquired Covid-19. This is because patients, especially in-patients, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 that is in the hospital for more than two hours, according to a study carried out by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB). While both government and private hospitals have separate pathways for Covid-19 patients, it is worrisome that other patients end up contracting the virus. A senior infection control specialist, who chose to remain anonymous, said, \"These cases are being noted despite our infection control protocols, as the virus movement in the hospital air is high. The other alternative could be that the number of asymptomatic carriers in the public is very high. Contacts of healthcare workers, patient caregivers and family members interact with society, leading to transmission and movement of virus. As immune-compromised are susceptible to virus, they are acquiring it.\"   Hospitals are finding it difficult to explain this challenge to patients who pick up the infection post surgery. Elective surgeries are finalised on various parameters, including when mere medication is no more effective. Patients have no option but opt for surgery. \"Separate pathways in hospitals require extensive care and extremely strong protocols, which healthcare workers have to follow. In the second Coronavirus wave, it is estimated that every fourth person is a carrier of virus. We are approaching a peak. During this time, it is better that patients put off their surgery in case it is not required urgently,\" a senior doctor said.   Similarly, senior citizens and other immune-compromised patients must not be called to hospitals for counselling for fear of them contracting virus in the air. They must be provided online consultation for some time to come. Dr Mustufa Afzal, senior infectious disease specialist at Care Hospitals, said, \"In the second wave, those with comorbid conditions are getting serious within 12 to 24 hours. The spike of virus within the body is immediate, and double mutant is a cause for concern.\" Dr Ashih Chauhan, senior general physician, said, \"Many patients are insisting on hospital admissions when it is not necessary. Trusting your family physician and opting for online consultation is the best way to protect oneself from variants of the virus. Patients panicking only aggravate their situation, as their basic parameters of blood pressures and sugars heighten in such circumstances.\"  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162630", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16853", "source": "scrapy"},

Finding her allegations “completely false, provocative and intemperate” statements, the EC said Ms Banerjee’s attacks and “attempts to berate and vilify the Central paramilitary forces during the electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation among the rank and file of these forces, who have been rendering yeoman’s service since the late 1980s in election after election….”   It also noted that the two-time CM “has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central paramilitary forces… Far more discouraging is the fact that Ms Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other. In fact, Ms Banerjee is sparing no efforts to ensure that a deep wedge and drift is created amongst them which is bound to have serious consequential damage even after the process of elections is over.”   Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in the city on Friday for the poll campaign, tore into the TMC chief over her all-out criticism of the Central forces and the accusations against him. Rejecting her claims, he observed that he had never heard of “a CM of a state or the head of a political party making attacking comments on the Central forces like Ms Banerjee.” Mr Shah urged the TMC chief to apply her “common sense”, reminding her of the “control” of the EC, instead of his ministry, on the Central forces during the polls. He also argued that Ms Banerjee has been “frustrated”, realising that she was facing defeat in the polls, which is reflected in her comments. “She should reply to the notice from the EC to her,” the Union home minister said.   The TMC chief, however, remained defiant despite the massive pressure that is mounting on her since this was the second notice in a gap of 24 hours to her from the EC over her violations of the MCC.  “I will keep talking against the CRPF and BSF as long as they are with the BJP. Otherwise, I will salute them. I respect and salute the jawans of our country. However, I would not do the same to those who are working on the instructions of Mr Shah.

Tech experts say the move to bring the country more in step with the rest of the digital world is crucial, but will cause \"chaos\" in a rocky transition period. Myanmar is the   to embrace unicode that has significant numbers of people online. Without it, most users see international content -- and a lot from within the country -- as lines of meaningless symbols. Household name websites can be impossible to read while translation and voice recognition software do not work. October 1 is \"U-Day\", when Myanmar officially adopts the new system. From then on, all electronic communication from government offices, telecoms companies, banks and media must be in Unicode by law. Myanmar became a global code anomaly due to isolation under its former military junta. Microsoft and Apple helped other countries standardise years ago, but Western sanctions meant Myanmar lost out. IT pioneer Zaw Htut, 47, describes this as the final battle won in a decades-long code \"war\". \"This is like changing to democracy,\" he enthuses. However, making the switch to Unicode will be a turbulent ride, and he warned that initially there will be \"chaos\". Facebook -- the main social media platform in the country -- has developed automatic conversion software to give users a \"seamless experience\", says strategic response team member Sarah Oh. But many will suddenly be unable to read messages on other apps and from banks or phone operators, while those who switch will no longer be able to communicate with friends still using the old system. A homegrown rival to Unicode called \"Zawgyi\" (pronounced: zaw-jee) -- meaning wizard -- evolved in Myanmar's detached digital ecosystem. Its popularity exploded as the country opened up from 2011 and smartphone use soared. Today around 90 per cent of people use Zawgyi instead of Unicode. Incompatible without fiddly plug-ins, it only allows people to communicate in Burmese with other Zawgyi users, excluding the nation's minority languages. Its clunkiness also means search functions do not work, crippling data storage systems. According to tech experts, it could take years to achieve full migration. Zaw Htut compares the abrupt switch to Unicode with the former junta's overnight decision for   to drive on the right instead of the left. \"But we're digitally empowering the nation,\" he said. Joox, a regional version of Spotify, said it is impossible to convert the millions of Burmese language songs on its app. With the deadline looming, celebrities and influencers are hammering home the need to convert while technicians prepare for a deluge of queries. An army of volunteers are helping in online forums and offline at teashops. \"There's a lot of confusion,\" explains computer science student Tin Lat Nandar, 23, as she updates retirees' phones at a Sunday drop-in session. Yangon street vendor Mi Mi, 35, says she has heard about the switch but does not want to change.  \"I don't know how to do it\", she said. An estimated 10 to 15 per cent of mainly older phones will not be advanced enough to convert. Many cheaper, illegally imported devices even come pre-installed with the old system -- putting those too poor to buy newer models at a clear disadvantage. Still others are excited at the wealth of information now at their fingertips. \"I'll be able to read Wikipedia in Burmese,\" says a beaming Aung Kyaw Oo, 62, as he leaves a drop-in session.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/09/27/111489-untitled-design-9.jpg?itok=-0gRDYRB\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162635", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22190", "source": "scrapy"},

The latest addition to this is  . The state government on Sunday (April 11) made it mandatory for people coming from seven high load states to produce a RT-PCR negative report obtained within 72 hours of entry, from April 16 onwards. These high load states are Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. This was part of the state government’s fresh guidelines issued by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur following a spike in Covid-19 cases across the state. The government has allowed tourists to visit the state as of now, but has also directed hotel owners and tourists to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures (SoPs) issued by the government, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said. Calling it a matter of concern, the CM said that during the last 45 days, the state has reported 10,690 new COVID-19 cases, while with 120 fatalities the number of deaths have also increased rapidly. Under the new guidelines, devotees in the state have been allowed to visit temples during the Navratri festival but they will have to perform ‘puja’ and ‘darshan’ by maintaining social distancing and using face masks.  However, organising ‘langars’ or community kitchens and ‘jagran’ have been banned by the government. No overcrowding would be allowed in buses and public transport vehicles, the CM said. Earlier this week, the state government had restricted gatherings in marriage ceremonies to 50 people indoor and maximum of 200 in open space while only 50 persons would be allowed to attend funerals.

It also comes as an opportunity for those seeking to make a shift toward healthier living. Well, why not start today! As per World Health Organisation (WHO), this year's  World Health Day theme is 'Building a fairer, healthier world'.  Stating that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the countries hard, WHO mentioned that ours is an unequal world where \"some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income...little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services.\" WHO urged leaders around the world to \"monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.\" And while people across the globe are still struggling to come to terms with how much life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a U.K.-based price comparison website Money.co.uk has come out with a list of the world’s healthiest countries in 2021. The publications release this list every year and this time too it has been published on World Health Day.  The publication mentioned that their mortgage experts rank the healthiest countries and cities in the world on the basis of \"good food, good company and good transport links\". Additionally, conditions like air quality, pollution levels, cost of living, life expectancy among other things are taken into consideration.  Below is the list of the top 5 world's healthiest countries. According to the report, Spain is the healthiest country in the world. It mentioned a few reasons such as their Mediterranean lifestyle, walking as a mode of transport, which helps to lower deaths caused by pollution, cost of living is moderate among other things why the country topped their list.  l: As per the report, Portugal bagged the second spot on the list of the world's healthiest countries. Their high-ranking healthcare system is the reason why the country has achieved good rankings in several health indices over the years, including this one.  Switzerland is home to one of the happiest populations. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum's 2013 Human Capital Report, Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world.  Home to the oldest living population in the world, Japan obviously has one of the highest life expectancies in the world! Other factors that contribute to Japan being in the top five are: their smaller portion sizes and protein-dense diet, their notoriously fast transportation, walking as the preferred mode of transportation and high cost of living matched with the price among other things.   Good healthcare system, healthy diet and clean water among other things such as low levels of smoking, makes Iceland one of the world's healthiest countries to live in. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162636", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34613", "source": "scrapy"},

The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer   on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said.   The US Navy said it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state.   The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.”   The MEA added: “The   was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile, the US Seventh Fleet said: “  (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”   It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162635", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17022", "source": "scrapy"},

In January 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, Pyongyang and Beijing closed their 880-mile border on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers and suspended all trade. The move devastated the North Korean economy, especially in border regions, where a large percentage of local commerce depends on the purchase and sale of goods imported from China. Additionally, smugglers from North Korea who make their living by shuttling goods to and from China suddenly found themselves struggling to make ends meet. Commerce in entire towns dried up and industries that rely on Chinese raw materials could not continue to operate. But this week, Chinese safety inspectors have been spotted on a major bridge connecting the Chinese city of Dandong with North Korea’s northwestern city of Sinuiju. “Yesterday an acquaintance who works at Dandong Station informed me they are inspecting and repairing railroad tracks so international trains between China and North Korea can begin running from early April,” a Chinese citizen of Korean descent told RFA’s Korean Service Tuesday. “They also set up new quarantine facilities in the Dandong and Sinuiju customs offices, which have been closed for more than a year because of the coronavirus, and they are waiting for trade to resume,” said the source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. Inspections and repairs are necessary because trains between the two border cities have not traversed the 74-year-old Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge in so long, the source said. The area near the bridge is a popular tourist spot where visitors to Dandong can catch a glimpse of the reclusive Stalinist state across the river. “We know that only freight cars will be allowed to cross the border, not passenger cars. I heard that North Korea is opening its borders to import food, building materials and agricultural goods, which they need immediately for their economic development plans,” the source said. “The inspectors from Dandong Station have been working on the tracks from morning to evening. They wear fluorescent safety clothes and helmets, so they are clearly visible to tourists around the bridge,” said the source. The source said that trains from China would only be allowed to travel as far as Sinuiju, unlike before the pandemic, when they passed through the border city on their way to Pyongyang, about 140 miles overland. “Perhaps it is because North Korea’s emergency quarantine measures have not yet been lifted, and this is freight-only, not a passenger train,” the source said. The emergency quarantine measures limit movement between provinces and absolutely prohibit any contact with Chinese. Another source, also from Dandong, confirmed to RFA that rail traffic would resume between the two cities in April. “Even if they reopen the border, the movement of people is prohibited and only freight will be allowed,” said the second source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. “Today I saw a number of inspectors at the bridge across the Yalu River. The coronavirus is a huge concern in North Korea, so the economic situation must be pretty serious if they are going to reopen the borders,” said the second source. News that trade between China and North Korea will resume has spread all over Dandong, and trade officials from North Korea and their Chinese counterparts have been feverishly working to get their deals in place ahead of the reopening, according to the second source. “Trade with North Korea has been suspended for more than a year, so traders in Dandong, who are on the verge of bankruptcy, are in a much better mood than before,” the second source said. The second source acknowledged that rumors of a resumption of trade had made the rounds in Dandong many times over the past year, but never came to fruition. “This time it’s different. Given the movement of all the North Korean trade workers in and around Dandong, and the inspections on the Yalu River bridge, the possibility that Sino-Korean trade will resume in April is really raising the expectations of all the traders from both countries,” said the source. In 2019, the last full year before North Korea and China stopped trading, total trade volume between the two countries amounted to slightly more than U.S. $3 billion, according to data from the Korea Trade Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). China was the origin country for 96 percent of North Korea’s imports in 2019 and was the destination country for 67 percent of North Korean exports, according to data published on the website of the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). According to a recent report by the UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights, the border closure caused many North Koreans to starve to death, with children and elderly resorting to begging in the streets or risking execution by breaking laws to obtain food from China. “Prolonged COVID-19 prevention measures have resulted in a drastic decline in trade and commercial activities and severe economic hardship to the general population, causing increased food insecurity,” said the report.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162633", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12951", "source": "scrapy"},

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.  Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors.   In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.  The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing.   “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said. Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday. In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm.   Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162636", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17750", "source": "scrapy"},

For the first time, the ghat road was open for buses to reach Srisailam after 9pm. Forest officials close the road after 9pm till 5am to avoid late-night driving, for the past several years.   The pilgrims who reached Srisailam from different parts of Karnataka on foot, covering hundreds of km, had their Darshan in the past two days. Now, when they want to return home, no bus service was available as KSRTC staff went on a strike since Wednesday.  Pilgrims have come to Srisailam from 13 districts in Karnataka, like Bijapur, Haveri, Bellari, Gulbarga, Raichur, Bidar, Hubbali, Bangalore, and Tumkur. Kurnool APSRTC regional manager  T Venkata Ramam said about 20 buses were sent on Thursday to Srisailam. There was some problem till afternoon and it was cleared thereafter, he said.   As the ZPTC and MPTC elections are also held on Thursday, we have dispatched 150 buses since Wednesday evening. Once they return on Thursday, they will be pressed into service, he said. “The passengers are brought up to Kurnool and from here they go to their respective destinations taking link services,” he said. A temple official said normally these pilgrims will wait till the Rathotsavam on April 13, Ugadi day. This year, maybe due to the corona scare, they were rushing to go back to their homes after the darshan.

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162630", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16251", "source": "scrapy"},

The Central forces gunned down four persons at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar. Another death also happened in the morning. From the very first day I have been vocal. Central forces are not my enemy. But the way it killed four voters standing in the queue only proved the Union home minister's conspiracy that has been on.

Where did they get so much audacity from? Where do so many atrocities originate from? BJP knows it has lost in the polls. That is why they are killing the voters and workers. What fault did they commit?\" Puncturing the Trinamul Congress supremo's claim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was also in the state for poll campaign in two districts, referred to Ms Banerjee's alleged provocation to attack the Central forces and warned her and her party workers against hooliganism. He mourned the loss of lives and urged the Election Commission for strong punishment for the accused of the killings.   Addressing a BJP rally in Siliguri of North Bengal, Mr Modi said, \"What happened in Coochbehar is very sad. I mourn the loss of lives in the killings. My condolences with their families. Didi and her goons have been panicked to see the support of the people for the BJP. Seeing herself losing the chair, Didi has stooped to such a low level! But I want to make it clear to the TMC, Didi and her goons that their muscle-flexing will not be allowed in Bengal. I request the Election Commission to take stringent action on the accused of the incident.\" He however told Ms Banerjee, \"But your tricks to provoke the people in attacking the Central forces on poll-duty and obstruct the polling process will not be able to save you. Your violence after a decade-long misdeed cannot save you. People are casting their votes in large numbers for BJP. North Bengal has shown it.\"    Standing by the Central forces for their role in the poll duty, Mr Modi observed that the TMC chief, not the forces, has become the biggest trouble in the polls.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162636", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16800", "source": "scrapy"},

The workers were part of a quasi-military construction brigade of   tasked with building 10,000 houses in the North Korean capital. They worked long and grueling hours during the day, retiring to their hastily made workers’ dormitory for about three hours of sleep each night. Sources told RFA that faulty wiring in their temporary living quarters started the fire on March 30, and many were unable to escape as it engulfed the entire building. “Late last month more than 20 storm troopers were killed at a residential construction site in Pyongyang where they lived and worked,” a source in Pyongyang told RFA’s Korean Service Monday. “The construction command conducted an investigation and found the cause to be a short circuit in an electrical wire,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. The source said the exhausted workers were unable to evacuate even though the fire lasted only a short while. “The storm troopers’ lodging at the construction site was built in a hurry. The roof and walls were made of boards and vinyl film and the electrical wiring was not properly done. The wires were all tangled, and it caused a short circuit which led to the fire,” said the source. “Because their living quarters were hastily built with flammable materials, it burnt down after only about 10 minutes. If they had been evacuated immediately after the fire started, there would have been fewer casualties… The person who was on night-watch duty had fallen asleep, so many died,” the source said. Authorities give construction managers unrealistic deadlines to complete their projects. The immense pressure forces many outfits to ignore the safety of the workers, according to the source. “Once an accident happens, the authorities put all the blame on the construction site officials, saying it was caused by their negligence,” said the source. “The citizens of Pyongyang are concerned. They say that so many workers are victims of accidents at construction sites, and they do not know how many more must be sacrificed in the future. The construction command knows that the order to complete 10,000 houses in such a short time is unreasonable, but they dare not object to the Central Party’s orders. This is what forces the workers to be sacrificed,” said the source. Another source from the capital confirmed the fire to RFA, saying that there were many workers cramped into the temporary shacks, with some even living in tents. “The living situation for those construction workers is so poor, even though the construction command orders that they take thorough measures for their own safety. But most of the storm troopers fall into a deep sleep as soon as they get to bed,” said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “They are exhausted from 12 to 14 hours of hard labor each day, so that’s why most of the storm troopers in the barracks were killed,” said the second source. Construction deaths increased in North Korea after leader Kim Jong Un took office in 2011 and made large-scale national projects a priority to boost his own profile, according to the second source. “Construction commanders are so eager to achieve results within the deadline set by the party. They never mention safety issues or the unfair sacrifices of the construction workers, and this is causing resentment among the people.” Accidents at construction sites are relatively common but casualties are usually in the single digits. RFA has reported several major construction accidents over the past few years. In May 2015, RFA reported that 20 were killed while working in a hydropower project in the country’s northern Ryanggang province, during two separate spillway tunnel collapses in March and April that year. The 20 were the latest of hundreds killed at the power plant since construction began two decades prior. A year before that, RFA reported that an unfinished 23-story apartment building in Pyongyang collapsed, with possibly hundreds living inside. The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the construction of the apartment building \"was not done properly, and officials supervised and controlled it in an irresponsible manner,\" in a rare disclosure that an accident had happened. Though KCNA did not publish a death toll, a South Korean official told domestic and international media that 92 families may have been living in the apartment complex at the time.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162636", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12635", "source": "scrapy"},

The Kim Il Sung Immortality Tower in the northwestern border city of Sinuiju is one of several such monuments that were built nationwide following the 1994 death of the national founder, grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un. The towers are adorned with slogans that proclaim the elder Kim, and sometimes his son and successor Kim Jong Il, as “eternal presidents” of the country. Authorities claim that Sinuiju is a hotbed for dissidents who would seek to deface the monument just before the country celebrates the “Day of the Sun” on the April 15 birth anniversary of Kim Il Sung, one of the most important holidays in the country. “Installation of the high-voltage electric fences began March 20 and was finished yesterday,” a resident of Sinuiju told RFA’s Korean Service April 3. “High-voltage electricity is flowing through the wire fence, which was installed in a hurry on the orders of the Central Committee [of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party]. It’s impossible for anyone to freely access the tower now,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. The source said the builders installed a door in the part of the fence facing nearby Chongnyon railway station so that people can enter to lay flowers at the tower on April 15 and other holidays. “The authorities suddenly installed a high-voltage electric wire fence and creating an atmosphere of fear surrounding this important landmark because forces resisting the regime could potentially appear in the Sinuiju area.” “Since last year, there have been dozens of officials who have been executed, removed from the party, or dismissed for corruption or failing to follow quarantine orders here in North Pyongan province. So it is natural for the leadership to feel uneasy,” said the source. Another source, a resident of nearby Ryongchon county, told RFA April 4 that Kim Jong Un has been focused on eliminating corruption in the country’s powerful institutions. “He has executed or removed core officials, including the principal of Kim Il Sung Higher Party School, and members of the party,” said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “Most of the purged officials were from the party and administrative agencies in North Pyongan province,” the second source said. Corruption is a way of life for those wielding government power in North Korea. Unable to survive on paltry government salaries, officials are bribed to look the other way by those engaged in illegal activities like smuggling or making illegal international phone calls. Those in higher positions often run the illegal businesses themselves. “Last year a bunch of customs officers from the Sinuiju office were arrested and executed for their corruption, but the purge that really hit home was that of the Kim Il Sung Higher Party School principal, as he was a native of the province,” the second source said. “Even after the Sinuiju customs officers were quickly replaced, government officials in Sinuiju were in turmoil as the provincial party secretary and the head of the security department suddenly disappeared one day. Authorities continue to purge senior officials, and they are saying they want to catch potential dissidents in the North Pyongan area including Sinuiju,” the second source said. A number of officials and residents in the province have been turned against the country’s leadership due to the ongoing purges, according to the second source. “The authorities are creating an atmosphere equivalent to a quasi-state of war by installing high-voltage fences around the Kim Il Sung Immortality Tower. They are trying to tell residents to prepare for contingencies because they don’t know what will happen in Sinuiju.” “We know that the fences will be installed in the parts of the city that border China sooner or later.” A North Korean defector who used to be a high-ranking official in Pyongyang told RFA that Sinuiju is a particularly dangerous part of the country watched closely by the government. “Dissident forces have been deep-rooted there since the Kim Il Sung era [1948-1994]. Authorities are very careful about who they appoint as secretaries for the provincial government and the city party up there,” the former official said. “Even when they investigated the [2004] Ryongchon train explosion disaster, which failed to assassinate Kim Jong Il, the authorities presumed it had been carried out by government officials in Sinuiju and so they first investigated the officials and related people.” Then-leader Kim Jong Il had passed through Ryongchon station on his way back from China just hours before the disaster, which killed about 3,000 people and was caused by “electrical contact caused by carelessness during the shunting of wagons loaded with ammonium-nitrate fertilizer,\" according to state media. Though there was widespread speculation that the disaster was a failed assassination attempt, South Korean intelligence has said it believes the event to have been an accident in a country with a poor industrial safety record and few resources to maintain infrastructure. South Korean lawmaker Thae Yong Ho, a senior North Korean diplomat before he defected, told the South Korean media in 2017 that Kim Jong Il ordered the executions of transportation officials including the country’s railway chief following the 2004 disaster. According to the former Pyongyang official, North Pyongan province has produced many well-known people and organizations opposed to the North Korean government or communism in general, including the late religious leader Moon Sung Myung, who fled to South Korea during the Korean War and founded the Unification Church. The Seoul-based  online newspaper reported in late March that North Korea has begun building electric fences along the Sino-Korean border in Chagang province, with plans to cover the entire 880-mile border. According to that report, Kim Jong Un ordered the fences as a measure to prevent illegal border crossers from bringing the coronavirus into the country.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162636", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13236", "source": "scrapy"},

Chandra, a professor in English at the Government Girls College in Indore, first commentated in the MCC v Bombay game in the 1976-77 season. Renowned cricket commentator Sushil Doshi said from Indore: “The only regret Col Nayudu had was that he had no money to get Chandra married. Chandra was a very good Hindi commentator. She was an English teacher but had equal command over our national language. \"Like her father, she wanted to be the first to do something. She inherited some of her father’s traits.  Chandra was a very brave and courageous lady. She would never accept defeat easily in her life,” said Doshi who considered Chandra as his elder sister. \r\n\"I was inspired by her in my commentary career. When I was travelling to Australia (in 1977-78) for commentary, she dropped me off the airport. My parents were very anxious about my first overseas trip and Chandra used to keep them company.”   Chandra was bed-ridden in her last few days. Her financial condition was very poor.

Both incidents took place in Cooch Behar of North Bengal, the BJP’s stronghold. The Election Commission said that the CISF had to fire in order to save lives of voters who came to vote, put in place certain restrictions, including extending the \"silence period\" from 48 hours to 72 hours for the fifth phase of polling West Bengal. It also barred the entry of politicians in Cooch Behar district for the next 72 hours to prevent any possible law and order flare-up.   The shocking incident took place at around 10.30 am when a group of TMC workers stormed a polling booth (No. 126) at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra in Shitalkuchi Assembly constituency. Facing their attack, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) troopers, who were guarding the booth, fired on the mob and shot dead four persons — Hamidul Haque, Monirul Haque, Samiul Mian and Amjad Hossain — while injuring three others.  According to the CISF, the mob of around 150 first manhandled the polling staff at the booth. Sources said they were not “armed”, but some were carrying bamboo sticks. \"The CISF booth commander tried to pacify the miscreants but the mob entered the polling booth and beat up the other polling staff on duty. Few miscreants tried to snatch the weapons of CISF personnel deployed there. As a result, CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air but the mob did not pay any heed to the warning. In the meantime, a quick response team of the CISF and police also reached the spot. The mob further started advancing aggressively towards CISF personnel. Therefore, sensing imminent danger to their life, they fired seven more rounds towards the advancing mob of miscreants. While the above incident was going on, more police parties also arrived at the booth. It is reported that in self-defence they have also fired a few rounds,\" the CISF said.   Polling was stopped immediately by the EC.  The CISF's justification of \"self-defence\" was supported by the district police and administration in its preliminary report to the EC which, issuing the CISF a clean chit later, said, \"Recourse to open fire by CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save lives of voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as mob had attempted to snatch their weapons.\" The TMC, however, described the shooting as “cold-blooded murder\" of its workers in its complaint to Chief Electoral Officer West Bengal Ariz Aftab. Spewing venom against the Central forces and Union home minister Amit Shah, an angry chief minister flew to Siliguri and announced that the Criminal Investigation Department would probe the killings.    The TMC chief is likely to visit the kin of the deceased on Sunday though the EC has banned the entry of any politician of any level in Shitalkuchi.  The tragic incident follows party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee's recent statements that the Central forces were acting in a biased manner at the behest of the BJP and asking voters to gherao them. On Saturday, her party landed in the dock after its workers shot dead a first-time voter, Ananda Burman (18), in the same district. The teenaged boy was standing in a queue outside a polling booth (No. 285) at Pathantuli Shalbari area when a scuffle broke out between TMC and BJP workers. Another person, close to him, also suffered bullet injuries.   Despite the poll-violence, the 44 seats spread across five districts of West Bengal recorded a voters' turnout of 76.16 per cent on average till 5 pm. While Cooch Behar saw 79.73 per cent polling in nine seats, the figure stood at 73.65 per cent in five of Alipurduar seats, 75.49 per cent in 11 seats of South 24 Parganas, 75.03 per cent in nine seats in Howrah and 76.02 per cent in 10 Hooghly seats.  Updated data is expected from the Election Commission on Sunday. Among the 11 seats in South 24 Parganas, five -- Jadavpur, Kasba, Tollygunge, Behala East and Behala West -- are actually located in Kolkata.  The Election Commission’s order said that in Cooch Behar, comprising nine Assembly constituencies where voting got over on Saturday, no political leader from any national, state or other party should be allowed to enter the geographical boundaries of the district for the next 72 hours.   \"The Election Commission of India further directs that the silence period for phase 5 (i.e. for polls scheduled on April 17) shall be extended to 72 hours and no campaigning shall be permitted during 72 hours before the close of the poll in order to ensure the conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections,\" an EC order said. The silence period is generally for 48 hours.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162636", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17996", "source": "scrapy"},

Prosecutors are now filing charges against the man, the owner of the Guestown-Lao company, whose plant in the province’s Nam Bak district was closed in late November, a labor official in Luang Prabang told RFA on Thursday. “The owner of the plant is a Chinese, who has now been detained,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The authorities are filing charges against him, and he will be brought to court soon,” he said. “The workers will now have to wait for a court decision to see if they will be paid,” he added. The shuttered Guestown-Lao company plant, which has now reopened under new owners, owes about 400 million kip (U.S. $42,500) in back pay to more than 200 employees, only some of whom have been rehired by the plant’s new managers. “The same plant with a new Chinese owner and a new company called Jiang Qe Co. called me and several others back to work, and we have been working here again since late February, one worker said. “The new owner told us that this is a different company that has nothing to do with the previous one, so we are still going to have to wait for our unpaid wages,” he said. Another worker said he remains unemployed, but can’t travel far from his home to find a new job. “My family is poor, and I can’t go to another town or province to work because I’m still waiting for my back pay,” he said, adding, “We haven’t heard anything from the authorities up till now.” “This was not the first time that the company didn’t pay us,” a third worker said, also speaking to RFA. “The plant paid us late several times before, and they only paid then because we protested.” Around 100 of the cement plant’s more than 200 unpaid workers gathered on Feb. 22 outside the home of the plant’s Chinese owner to demand their wages, sources told RFA in an earlier report, with one worker saying the owner had fled his home before they arrived. “We came here several times in December and January to ask for our back pay, but nothing happened. Then, in early February, we filed a written complaint with the district and provincial labor departments and with the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare,” the worker said. “We waited for almost a month, and nothing happened, so we came here to protest on Feb. 22,” he said. Reports have increased in recent years of the high-handed treatment of Lao workers by their Chinese bosses, and of increasing resentment over a rapidly growing Chinese business presence in the country. A Lao teenager working at a motorcycle shop in Bokeo province killed his Chinese employer in early March following a heated argument over working hours and the man’s abuse of his local employees, while in June 2020 a young Lao worker was beaten, shocked, and tied up by his supervisors at a Chinese banana plantation in Vientiane province. Concern has also been growing in Laos over China’s growing influence as a result of its massive investment in hydropower dams, a major railway, and other infrastructure projects under Beijing’s $1.3 trillion Belt and Road Initiative. China is Laos’ largest foreign investor and aid provider, and its second-largest trade partner after Thailand. Lao authorities announced on Thursday that China had donated 800,000 doses of the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine to its communist neighbor.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162637", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12175", "source": "scrapy"},

Some moments and memories are so special that all it takes is a small sensory cue to take one to a different timeline of one's life. This is often captured by the expression 'madeleine de proust' one of the key passages in Marcel Proust book 'In search of lost time' when a particular sight, smell, food, a song, or an experience unexpectedly unlocks a past recollection. For instance, the smell of jasmine flowers reminds me of my grandmother and how fondly she used to place them near her pillow. It's not uncommon when a simple song triggers a plethora of past memories. No wonder when sometimes I miss my mother near me, I try to do or make something exactly the way she does to intentionally create a madeleine moment and then soak myself in the nostalgia and priceless feelings associated with childhood memories. The reverse is also true. There are events or moments of life thinking about which can make one feel awful. It could be related to anything in the past like the unexpected loss of a loved one, changing dynamics of cherished relationships, emotionally taxing incidents or the struggles in the present moment that instantly makes one negative. Sometimes when a negative situation stays for too long, it can leave one overwhelmed in a way that the person seems to be addicted to negativity or develops a habit of ruminating. For instance, acting as a caregiver where hopes are not high, clinging to a toxic relationship or sticking with the wrong job because of one's helpless condition perceived or real. Rumination is continuously getting lost in a thought loop where you eventually end up thinking about that same negative or sad thought or experience. Why is it that we end up remembering what we want to forget? Perhaps negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that even when an individual has made a conscious thought to not pay heed to it, it keeps coming back. One of the reasons people ruminate is owing to the belief that by ruminating they will probably get an insight into their life or problem. However, it doesn't work out because in a state of ruminating the person is focused more on the problems and consequences instead of solutions. The person may perceive it as natural coping mechanism to adapt with the pain, but one has to ponder whether it's helping one solve a problem or just trapping back in an unhealthy thought cycle. Dwelling on negative thoughts and engaging in self-blame has been associated with mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Research by Peter Kinderman professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they had experienced many negative events in their lives. The question is how to intentionally forget things that only serve to disturb us. Can we exercise influence on our memory? Perhaps the easiest way to forget something is not revisiting it in your mind. There are many theories related to the process of motivated forgetting that suggest that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. According to Freud, memories that are likely to induce guilt, embarrassment, shame or anxiety are actively, but unconsciously, pushed out of consciousness as a form of ego defence. Unconscious or repressed memories are exceedingly difficult to retrieve but remain available. People may resort to 'repression' in which they subconsciously push unpleasant thoughts and feelings into their unconscious as an automatic defensive mechanism. Thought 'suppression' is also a  type of motivated forgetting when an individual consciously attempts to stop thinking about a particular thought. Memories are also forgotten through distortion as perGestalt theory of forgetting. This is also called false memory syndrome in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by false memories, recollections that are factually incorrect but yet are strongly believed. Rehearsing negative memories by ruminating over them only serve to strengthen them, so it's important to forget certain things to live life peacefully. Apparently, we may never forget things completely but when we stop thinking about them, it often fades away as we remember fewer facts. If rumination is affecting your personal growth stop and take notice of the circumstances and triggers that lead you to ruminate. Eliminating the trigger may not be possible always but by practicing mindfulness one can consciously try to respond with an element of awareness breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. This may require consistent practice and conscious efforts but it's important to check yourself lest negativity pulls you into a trap again. Finding a distraction like going for a walk, playing a game, calling a friend, watching a movie or getting engaged in any activity that breaks the chain can also be helpful. If constant rumination is disabling you and you are unable to focus your attention on other important things of life, seeking therapy can be beneficial. Otherwise meditating can also reduce rumination because it helps in de cluttering the mind to arrive at an emotionally calm state. Life is fleeting and made up of a collection of moments. Clinging on to negative experiences will only make us miss out on the beauty of 'now'.Next time if your answer to this question 'Do you remember what you want to forget?' carries away your mind to unpleasant memories and events, change the question itself. Ask yourself - 'Do you forget what you want to remember?' Answering it will not only break the thought cycle and distract your mind but transport you to all the beautiful memories and the blessings in the present moment, that perhaps money can't buy but fills the heart with gratitude.

Although diving for treasures is no longer a necessity for many, some traders are keeping the tradition alive. The history of pearl diving in the UAE goes back to more than 7,000 years ago. A time when UAE pearls travelled to Rome, Venice, Sri Lanka and even to India. United Arab emirate's pearls were one of the most sought-after accessories of the time. Abdullah al-Suwaidi recalls how his family's fortune depended on pearling much before the discovery of oil in the gulf. \"I lived and grew up around my grandfather, who lived off of pearl diving. He taught me a lot about pearl diving because of my continuous stream of questions and requests for more information and stories of adventure. It inspired my imagination.\", said Abdullah al Suwaidi, owner of a pearl farm. With UAE's petroleum exports reaching sixty-six point two billion dollars this year. Commercial pearl trading has become a dying tradition and Suwaidi's farm is the only commercial pearl farm in the United Arab Emirates. Abdullah al Suwaidi, also added that \"It is regrettable that nations that didn't even exist in 1906 (when it came to pearling) are now the biggest producers of pearls in the world, and the Gulf states, including the UAE, do not contribute (to the trade).\" Back in the hay days, pearl diving offered seasonally if not full-time work for many local Emiratis. Suwaidi managed to keep the tradition alive and still thrills curious tourists by demonstrating how his ancestors would pick oysters off the seabed. Legend has it that once the owner of luxury jewellery brand, Jaques Cartier had travelled to the gulf in pursuit of the world's most precious and exquisite pearls.

Speaking to reporters after a closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders on Saturday, Mr Lee said: “I told them that I had concluded that we should prepare to make such a move for nurses because people's attitudes have changed, because in social and work settings, the tudung is now more common. \"And on its own, we can see the merits of allowing ... Muslim nurses to wear the tudung with their uniform if they wish.” He added that the community leaders knew that the Government has been considering allowing Muslim nurses to wear the tudung for “quite some time”, because the Government has been “engaging and consulting them quietly”. But before the change is made, the Government will need to “prepare the ground”, said the Prime Minister. “We have to make sure that everybody understands this is a careful adjustment. Not a wholesale change, and we want people to realise what the limits are, as we make these changes,” Mr Lee added. “And we must make sure that Singaporeans, both Muslims and non-Muslims, are ready to accept the move.” The process will “take a bit of time”, and Mr Lee has asked the community leaders to help the Government with the process over the next few months. “I hope that by the National Day Rally, which will be at the end of August, we should be ready to make a decision, and I shall have something to report,” said the Prime Minister. The closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders was the Prime Minister’s first such dialogue since 2014, when the subject of wearing the tudung was also raised. “Today we had a candid and sincere discussion, focusing more specifically on tudung for nurses. But, of course, going beyond that too,” said Mr Lee. He thanked them for “walking with the Government on this complex journey” and for helping them to manage an important issue. “We are a multiracial and multireligious country. It's a delicate balance, but we are fully committed to preserving our harmony, and to maintaining our common space,” he said. “We want to avoid creating unintended consequences … when we make well intentioned moves.” Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the dialogue was “constructive and candid” and that the community leaders got to hear what the Government’s position and considerations are. He added that there was a common understanding that this issue must be approached carefully because it involves racial and religious sensitivities. \"Therefore, we cannot rush to a decision. At the heart of the matter is how we strike a good balance in allowing our nurses to put on the tudung with their uniform, so that this decision can win the support of all communities, preserve common space and at the same time strengthen our social cohesion,\" he said. He added that in doing so, the Government hoped it can support the request by nurses to don the tudung with their uniform. “We know, we empathise that they want to lead meaningful religious lives daily, because this is also their religious identity,” said Mr Masagos. “Our racial and religious harmony is precious and the Malay Muslim community will safeguard these together with the rest of Singaporeans. We’ll continue to engage Singaporeans on this matter. “I hope to seek everyone's support as we deliberate on this issue, and work towards an outcome that’s acceptable to all Singaporeans.” Mr Masagos added that the Government has “always empathised” with the request by nurses to put on their tudung with their uniform. “But we have to be very careful, because it is not just about the Muslim request alone. Any move, any change in our society must be (carried) very carefully, because it involves interaction with other people,” he added. He said it is a “whole-of-government” approach and that they are reaching out to “every stakeholder” on this issue. Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam in March signalled a likely change in the Government's stance on nurses wearing the tudung, and said they were consulting the community. MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) had raised the issue in Parliament earlier this year. Mr Masagos answered on Mar 8 that the Government would continue to have discussions and consultations with the community behind closed doors. Mufti Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said on Saturday the tudung issue is about balancing the religious needs of communities. \"For example, in this case, the needs of Muslim nurses who choose to put on the tudung, while maintaining a high level of trust and confidence between communities,\" he said. \"So conversations between Government and community leaders and religious leaders are very important for us to consider the full range of perspectives, as well as context for the considerations involved before moving to shift the policy.\" He said it is very important that they “should not make a move that may undermine” Singapore's social cohesion, but instead to continue to strengthen it and \"enlarge our common spaces\". \"I think due to the hard work of our communities in forging greater trust and confidence, we are in a better position now to move on with such a change, and I hope that we will continue to give the support, working together with the relevant agencies to ensure that this policy shift will only result in a stronger and more united society,\" he said. Madam Rahayu Mohamad, a MUIS council member and former president of the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS), said Muslim women who wish to \"observe their religious prescription\" would welcome the move.  \"The women that we actually talked to are educated and they're well informed, and the reason why they are still in these sectors is because they understand and (understand) very well in terms of the decision and the choices that they're making,\" she said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162636", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48108", "source": "scrapy"},

Taking a giant step for diversity, the Biden-Harris Administration seeks to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. On Friday the administration submitted US President Joe Biden's priorities for 2022 discretionary spending to Congress. \"This goal aligns with President Biden's commitment to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all,\" said acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk.  While the first cadre of astronauts for the Artemis program was announced in December, the first two crew members for Artemis III in 2024 have yet to be announced. The initial group of 18 represents a diverse team of astronauts, including those new to NASA and veterans of spaceflight. The Artemis astronauts also include Indian American Raja Chari. \"These are historic moments in advancing equity for all of mankind,\" said Bhavya Lal, acting NASA chief of staff. She added that the announcement is personally \"very meaningful\" to her. Lal came to the US at 18 years old, carrying two suitcases full of books and never imagining she would work at NASA in the future. \"If you can see it, you can believe it,\" she said in a tweet. Returning astronauts to the moon will act as a proving ground before sending them on to Mars, a long-term goal of the Artemis program.  When astronauts explore the lunar south pole, which has never been visited by humans before, they will build on the legacy and science gained during the Apollo program and carry it into a new century.In a statement released by , the proposed spending also calls for an increase of more than 6 percent than the previous year.  \"This USD 24.7 billion funding request demonstrates the Biden Administration's commitment to NASA and its partners who have worked so hard this past year under difficult circumstances and achieved unprecedented success,\" Jurczyk said.  \"The President's discretionary request Strengthens NASA's ability to better understand Earth and how it works as an integrated system, from our oceans to our atmosphere, how it all impacts our daily lives, and how it all is impacted by climate change,\" he added. In addition to aiding the Artemis program and studying climate change, the President's request would also help further the agency's robotic exploration of space, provide a boost to aviation technology and provide new funding for NASA's efforts to engage in STEM outreach for underserved students, according to the agency. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162641", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "33743", "source": "scrapy"},

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming  . BHG Holdings also reported a 40 to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods, to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours.   The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners. Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.  From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020. It stands at 10 per cent now.  Property tax rebates passed on by property owners have dried up. Although retail rent is expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.  Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm. Perhaps it also knows not keeping up risks losing loyal customers to competing malls.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/9068518/1957a42a2a1da80ba693669103d71585/sing-tien-foo-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Sing Tien Foo \">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162641", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "49262", "source": "scrapy"},

Throughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day. We have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh’s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959. The Duke of Edinburgh’s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.

A Russian demining team has been working with Lao counterparts to clear the UXO since Dec. 5, 2020, the provincial officials recently told RFA’s Lao Service, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans with the media. “The Russians came here to build a military airport on the other side of the Plain of Jars,” one of the officials said, referring to the archeological landscape in the Xieng Khouang Plateau that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019. “They’re currently clearing the UXO and then they’re going to upgrade the existing airport, making it larger and more beautiful.” Another Xieng Khouang official, who is a provincial military officer, provided further details about the new airport to RFA. “The Russian and Lao armed forces together are building this new airport that will be larger than the existing one and will be divided in two different zones,” he said. “One zone is for Lao and Russian military use and the other is for civilian use.” The officer said that the Russian military intends to provide substantial assistance to Laos going forward, including with training and developing the latter’s armed forces. “Some work on the new airport has already begun, but the actual construction will not start anytime soon because the UXO clearance will take some time,” he said. “Once the UXO has been cleared, we’ll lay underground powerlines. We’ll do our work step by step.” Besides the airport, the Russians intend to expand military cooperation with Laos that will include building a facility to train Lao troops on how to use Russian military equipment, according to a report by Russian news agency Sputniknews.com. A former senior government official in Laos told RFA that the two sides are expanding cooperation in line with an agreement they have in place on security and defense, as well as the new airport. “In the agreements, most cooperation would include training and teaching military techniques to the Lao armed forces,” said the former official, who also declined to be named. “We had more cooperation and more Russian military presence in Laos during the Soviet era,” he added. RFA spoke with an official at the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs who claimed not to know anything about the Russian military aid projects. In 2018, Laos ordered four jet fighters and 10 Yak-130 tanks from Russia following a state visit to Moscow by Laos’ then-Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith a year earlier, during which the two nations signed a military cooperation agreement. Four of the tanks were later delivered to the Lao Ministry of Defense by Russia’s Rosoboronexport Company and took part in a 2019 parade commemorating the 70  anniversary of the Lao People’s Armed Forces in the capital Vientiane. In April 2019, Russia’s TASS news agency reported that the Russian and Lao defense ministries had agreed on the areas of expanding military cooperation between their two countries on the sidelines of the Moscow International Conference on International Security, citing Lao Defense Minister Chansamone Chanyalath. The report did not provide details of the agreement. In June last year, Laos unveiled plans to build statues to honor two unnamed Soviet pilots who died while serving in the Southeast Asian country, angering citizens who said the U.S. $775,000 earmarked for the project could be better spent on recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. The pilots were in Laos as part of Moscow’s military presence in the fellow communist country between 1975 and 1992 and are believed to have been involved in training pilots in Laos’ air force. An official from the Ministry of Information Culture and Tourism told RFA at the time that the pilots were killed in a crash over Xieng Khouang province while on a practice mission. According to a report on the Lao Defense Ministry website, Chansamone Chanyalath met with Russian ambassador to Laos Vladimir Kalinin at the Russian Embassy in Vientiane on Dec. 29, 2020 and thanked him for Russia’s gift of a hangar to store tanks in Xieng Khouang province. Chansamone also expressed gratitude for joint military exercises held in the province in 2019, Russia’s assistance with UXO clearance, its work in upgrading the airport in Xieng Khouang, and for building an office of the Russian Military Representative in the province. The meeting took place a week after Russia’s military donated an air force training center to Laos. Moscow was a major arms supplier to Laos after its communist government, closely associated with the Soviet-aligned communist government in Vietnam, was established in 1975. According to a January report in   recent aid to Laos highlights the country’s importance in Russia’s desire for broader defense cooperation in Southeast Asia. Russia has provided various forms of assistance to Laos in recent years. In January, TASS cited Russian Ambassador Kalinin as saying that Moscow and Vientiane had agreed on deliveries of two million doses of Russia’s homegrown Sputnik V vaccine, which would be used to inoculate around 25 percent of the Lao population against the coronavirus.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"laos-russian-base.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/laos-russian-base.jpg/@@images/132b471c-7101-45c1-a9bf-ffb8c02d72f6.jpeg\" title=\"laos-russian-base.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162639", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12340", "source": "scrapy"},

In most cases, we tend to brush off such attempts to breach our online privacy, because these things seem relatively harmless compared to the more pressing issues when it comes to women, such as the recent spike in gender-based violence. However, are such acts really that harmless? Women are harassed online in many ways, and unsolicited texts are just the tip of the iceberg, along with friend requests from unknown people. You must have come across revolting comments under pictures of female celebrities or of any woman that goes viral, most of which can be classified under hate speech. You most probably have heard stories of leaked private pictures, videos or information without consent – also known as doxxing – and the devastating toll it takes on the victims. \"I have been harassed online by men on many counts. Often, they were in the form of continuous pestering texts that start off nice, but get more degrading with time. Sometimes, their texts are accompanied by inappropriate pictures or videos,\" shares Fabiha Fairooz*, a freelance writer. \"Once, when I was in high school, a group of boys decided to bully my friends and I in a group chat,\" says Zareen Tasnim*, who is now completing her undergraduate degree abroad. \"They made very weak yet unacceptable attempts at insulting me, which had to do with my financial status, my dual nationality, my looks etc. They were even petty enough to make comments about me sending memes in that group chat.\" This is a serious problem which has only increased during the pandemic since we are forced to spend more time online than ever before. According to a recent report by  , 80 percent of the victims of cyberbullying in Bangladesh are adolescent girls and women in their early twenties. In another report by  , most victims of cyberbullying do not report to the police, hence the statistic does not take into account the cybercrimes that go unreported. The question arises, why don't people report cybercrimes? Anika Anjum Iftee, Head of Content Development and Marketing at WeMen View, a non-profit social welfare organisation which works to raise awareness against cyber harassment of women, thinks that such cases are generally taken less seriously than physical ones. \"It's because there are too many factors to consider. With the ongoing calling out culture, the conversation around things like unsolicited texts could be easily manipulated, which can make the main discourse rather confusing. Also, since how we behave on social media is an evolving process, there is still so much to define and to make laws on concretely. While all of that happens, a lot of us will be unfortunate enough to fall victim to online harassment.\" The fact that technology is evolving too fast for us to catch up on the expanding confines of online harassment rings very true. Almost every day, new strides are being made in technology with more opportunities for harassers to abuse them. In this dizzying mess, no wonder tech-savvy women are struggling to deal with a constant barrage of harassment, both big and small. \"I don't think there's much to do. In my experience of receiving unwanted texts, I find that confronting these men is very draining because most see no wrong in their actions and will continue to verbally abuse you or others,\" Fabiha adds. It is as clear as daylight that the toxic standards most men in this region have been brought up to contribute to their interactions online. The firm belief that they will get away with harassing women in both physical and virtual spaces unfortunately enables them to do so. In addition, the common yet unjust shaming of female victims further encourages these abusers to carry on, as Zareen and her friends had faced, \"This cyberbullying incident was reported to the school management, but they didn't fulfil their promises. Instead, they resorted to victim blaming by accusing us of isolating one of our classmates who egged those boys on, even though we weren't friends with her in the first place.\" For all kinds of abuse, for too long, women have been putting in all the work to rage against the injustice. In the case of cyber harassment, from tightening privacy settings to filing cases, women still carry the burden to take preventive measures. However, prevention is not the only cure, at least in this case. In order to see an end to harassment not limited to the digital realm, education comes first, as Anjum explains, \"Measures should be integrated into the way we socialise from an early stage. At WeMen View, we want to teach children how to respect other genders and expand to do workshops with parents too. Humility and kindness are very important in the process of learning how to behave. Children need to know about the obvious red flags because if we are not aware of the danger, we won't be ready to tackle it.\" In the end, it all comes down to getting acquainted with some very simple, basic concepts: consent and respecting one's personal space, and that these apply to everyone regardless of any parameter that you can think of. If we keep all these in mind, perhaps one day all the spheres we occupy, the virtual one included, can be safe for everyone. * \n 1. The Daily Star (December 10, 2020).  2.

Speaking to reporters after a closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders on Saturday, Mr Lee said: “I told them that I had concluded that we should prepare to make such a move for nurses because people's attitudes have changed, because in social and work settings, the tudung is now more common. \"And on its own, we can see the merits of allowing ... Muslim nurses to wear the tudung with their uniform if they wish.” He added that the community leaders knew that the Government has been considering allowing Muslim nurses to wear the tudung for “quite some time”, because the Government has been “engaging and consulting them quietly”. But before the change is made, the Government will need to “prepare the ground”, said the Prime Minister. “We have to make sure that everybody understands this is a careful adjustment. Not a wholesale change, and we want people to realise what the limits are, as we make these changes,” Mr Lee added. “And we must make sure that Singaporeans, both Muslims and non-Muslims, are ready to accept the move.” The process will “take a bit of time”, and Mr Lee has asked the community leaders to help the Government with the process over the next few months. “I hope that by the National Day Rally, which will be at the end of August, we should be ready to make a decision, and I shall have something to report,” said the Prime Minister. The closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders was the Prime Minister’s first such dialogue since 2014, when the subject of wearing the tudung was also raised. “Today we had a candid and sincere discussion, focusing more specifically on tudung for nurses. But, of course, going beyond that too,” said Mr Lee. He thanked them for “walking with the Government on this complex journey” and for helping them to manage an important issue. “We are a multiracial and multireligious country. It's a delicate balance, but we are fully committed to preserving our harmony, and to maintaining our common space,” he said. “We want to avoid creating unintended consequences … when we make well intentioned moves.” Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the dialogue was “constructive and candid” and that the community leaders got to hear what the Government’s position and considerations are. He added that there was a common understanding that this issue must be approached carefully because it involves racial and religious sensitivities. \"Therefore, we cannot rush to a decision. At the heart of the matter is how we strike a good balance in allowing our nurses to put on the tudung with their uniform, so that this decision can win the support of all communities, preserve common space and at the same time strengthen our social cohesion,\" he said. He added that in doing so, the Government hoped it can support the request by nurses to don the tudung with their uniform. “We know, we empathise that they want to lead meaningful religious lives daily, because this is also their religious identity,” said Mr Masagos. “Our racial and religious harmony is precious and the Malay Muslim community will safeguard these together with the rest of Singaporeans. We’ll continue to engage Singaporeans on this matter. “I hope to seek everyone's support as we deliberate on this issue, and work towards an outcome that’s acceptable to all Singaporeans.” Mr Masagos added that the Government has “always empathised” with the request by nurses to put on their tudung with their uniform. “But we have to be very careful, because it is not just about the Muslim request alone. Any move, any change in our society must be (carried) very carefully, because it involves interaction with other people,” he added. He said it is a “whole-of-government” approach and that they are reaching out to “every stakeholder” on this issue. Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam in March signalled a likely change in the Government's stance on nurses wearing the tudung, and said they were consulting the community. MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) had raised the issue in Parliament earlier this year. Mr Masagos answered on Mar 8 that the Government would continue to have discussions and consultations with the community behind closed doors. Mufti Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said on Saturday the tudung issue is about balancing the religious needs of communities. \"For example, in this case, the needs of Muslim nurses who choose to put on the tudung, while maintaining a high level of trust and confidence between communities,\" he said. \"So conversations between Government and community leaders and religious leaders are very important for us to consider the full range of perspectives, as well as context for the considerations involved before moving to shift the policy.\" He said it is very important that they “should not make a move that may undermine” Singapore's social cohesion, but instead to continue to strengthen it and \"enlarge our common spaces\". \"I think due to the hard work of our communities in forging greater trust and confidence, we are in a better position now to move on with such a change, and I hope that we will continue to give the support, working together with the relevant agencies to ensure that this policy shift will only result in a stronger and more united society,\" he said. Madam Rahayu Mohamad, a MUIS council member and former president of the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS), said Muslim women who wish to \"observe their religious prescription\" would welcome the move.  \"The women that we actually talked to are educated and they're well informed, and the reason why they are still in these sectors is because they understand and (understand) very well in terms of the decision and the choices that they're making,\" she said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162642", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48108", "source": "scrapy"},

In 1986, a nuclear meltdown shut down the whole town, and sent shockwaves across all of Europe.  Dubbed as the world’s worst nuclear accident, it killed over 40 people immediately. However, there’s no way of knowing the real numbers, for a nuclear fallout has long-term effects, with people expected to develop cancer due to radiation for decades to come! The site has been in the headlines again recently, as the radiation levels across the city have shot up!  Recently, a forest fire has spiked the radiation levels in the deserted town by over 16 times! “There is bad news – radiation is above normal in the fire’s centre,” Yegor Firsov, Ukraine’s state ecological inspection service head, said on Facebook on Sunday, as reported by The Guardian. In a clip posted by him, the radiation levels can be seen hovering 16 times above normal on a Geiger device, which is used to measure radiation. The fire is increasingly gaining traction and is currently burning over 250 acres of forest land. Ukrainian authorities have responded to the crisis by deploying two aircraft, a helicopter, and over 100 firefighters to contain the fire. As per media reports, the fire began on Saturday and continued to circle the abandoned town. However, the radiation levels remained stable yesterday, as the fire remained contained within the burning grounds. Even though high radiation is dangerous, local authorities claim that nearby towns are safe.  However, the radiation is a potential hazard for firefighters, who are directly in the line of fire. Even after 33 years, the radiation levels have not normalised, and are not expected to normalise for many decades to come. The fallout from any nuclear plant or disaster has long-term effects.

The plan attaches nearly impossible conditions for granting the Palestinians their hoped-for state that sides with Israel on borders, the status of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements. \r\n  \r\nIt's being proclaimed as the deal of the century. Many Presidents before Donald Trump have tried and all of them have failed to bring peace between Israel and Palestine. \r\n  \r\nSo how is Donald Trump's deal different from the earlier ones. For starters, Israel supports the deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed gratitude to Trump and said this was an opportunity of the century. \r\n  \r\nNetanyahu's gratitude towards Trump is because the deal is stacked largely in Israel's favour. There will be a 4-year freeze on Israeli settlements which means a halt in the expansion of Israel's construction activities in the West Bank. \r\n  \r\nThe deal promises to double the area under the control of the Palestinian authorities. But a major portion of the West Bank settlements will be recognised under Israeli sovereignty. \r\n  \r\nTrump has vowed to grant statehood to Palestine if it demilitarises and stops funding terror groups. As expected the deal does advocate the 2-state solution. According to the President, an undivided Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel. \r\n  \r\nIn the same breath, Trump also said he would proudly open a US embassy in a Palestinian capital in eastern Jerusalem. It's still unclear as to how such an arrangement could work. The contentious Jordan valley has been recognised as part of Israel due to national security reasons. And on the economic front, Palestine has been promised $50 billion in investment with more than a million jobs to be created. \r\n  \r\nThe deal continues to draw on many aspects from the Oslo accords, including the region's map. The architect of the plan, Jared Kushner has said that the different parts of Palestine will be linked using tunnels, overbridges and huge highways. \r\n  \r\nBoth Kushner and Trump called this deal the last chance for peace in the region.The major stakeholder in the deal, Palestine have outrightly rejected the deal. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called it the slap of the century. \r\n  \r\nBut according to Jared Kushner, the Palestinians look like fools for rejecting the deal.

Among the eight confirmed victims were former first lady Keosaiychai Xayasone and former Vientiane province Gov. Vidong Xayasone the wife and son of Choummaly Xayasone, who served as president from 2006 to 2016. The former president was among 40 survivors. The accident occurred at about 8 a.m. in the middle of the Nam Ngeum reservoir. Xayasone and his family had just left a family event at the nearby Chinese-owned-and-operated Dansavanh Resort and Casino. According to initial reports from the provincial government and a local rescue team, the number of passengers and crew was believed to be 39, of which rescuers were able to save 31.

A member of the rescue team told RFA's Lao Service Monday that according to the latest figures, 40 of 48 survived the accident.  “During the search operation, the conditions were still harsh. It was still raining and the winds were gusting. It took us some time to get from the shore to the scene of the accident.

According to the official, the water level in Bokeo was at 2.52 meters (99.2 inches) on April 2. “I think the Chinese dams might be releasing water, but I’m not sure because I’ve not been officially informed,” the official said. Fluctuating water levels in Southeast Asia’s most important waterway pose threats to aquatic plants and fish, which thousands of people living along the Mekong in Laos rely on for their livelihood. A fisherman from Laos’ northwestern Xayaburi province told RFA that a sudden change in water level was bad for fish stocks. “The Mekong River has risen about 10 centimeters [four inches]. I’m concerned that the rising water will affect aquatic vegetation and fish,” the fisherman said. “Before, the water was thick and rich in sediment. Now it is clear and has fewer fish. The fish are reproducing less and less these days. During this time of year, the fish lay their eggs, but when the water rushes through, it washes them all away,” said the fisherman. A farmer from the same province said the unpredictable water levels made his work difficult. “The water level depends on Chinese dams, and the waterflow is not natural. It’s hard to make a living on the river these days,” the farmer said. In the capital Vientiane, a vegetable garden owner told RFA that the increased water level was good for some industries but bad for others. “The water level is up by about one ladder step over the past two days. That’s good for boat navigation, but bad for fishing and vegetable planting. I grow peanuts on a sand bed that is about to be flooded,” the gardener said. Montree Chanthawong, a Thailand-based Mekong River expert, told RFA that the river’s water level is not supposed to rise during the dry season. “The rising water could hurt aquatic species like fish and aquatic vegetation. Some of them could even die. Sparrows lay their eggs on the sand beds too, and when the water level rises these can become flooded,” he said. Nowat Roykaew, the president of the Thailand-based Chiang Khong Conservation Group, told RFA that water levels in the Mekong have been fluctuating since January. “Sometimes it goes up a lot like right now. I notice that the rising water is now clear. That means the water is coming from Chinese dams, because if it came from rain, it would be turbid. The water fluctuation has broken down the whole eco-system,” he said. Data from the Washington-based Stimson Center’s Mekong Dam Monitor project indicated that during the week of March 29 to April 4, five Chinese dams released water. Don Sahong Dam in southern Laos also released water during the same period. During its update for the week of March 22-28, the Monitor said that river levels at Chiang Saen, Thailand had continued to rise. “This is not normal for this time of the year and is a result of significant upstream dam releases from China's cascade,” the update said, adding that releases would likely continue in the coming months. The update also reported that Thai conservationists had recently posted photos of migratory bird nests and eggs along the riverbanks to show that a 50 cm (20 inch) rise in the water level would submerge the nests. “That rise is likely to come over the next month given upstream releases. This is just one example of how altering the river's natural cycle of dry season lows and wet season highs is killing the river's natural resource base,” the update said. China has drawn criticism from its downstream neighbors for its cascade of 11 mega-dams on the Mekong River, with the lower Mekong basin experiencing severe drought over the past year and some stretches of the river even drying up entirely. In October 2020, Beijing agreed to share data with the Mekong River Commission, as some 60 million people in MRC members Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam use the river for agriculture and fishing. Neighbors of Laos have also complained about its nearly 80 dams on the Mekong River and its tributaries under the country’s controversial economic strategy to become the “Battery of Southeast Asia” by selling hydropower to neighbors.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162642", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11852", "source": "scrapy"},

Voters were seen standing in long queues braving the sweltering heat at several polling stations to cast their vote. In Nellore district, a BJP supporter dumped a ballot box in a water tub at Ponugodu village of Anuma Samudram Peta mandal falling under Atmakur assembly segment following a row with the ruling party agents over helping the aged people to reach polling station to cast their votes.   District collector KVN Chakradhar Babu announced the repoll in the village on Friday. Tellagunta villagers of Bogole mandal boycotted the polling to express their protest over not providing drinking water facilities in the village. In Prakasam district, the car of Darsi MLA Maddisetty Venugopal’s brother Ravindra was damaged as he went to Sivaramapuram village in Tallur mandal to see the polling trend. In West Godavari, a voter identified as Seshadri Venkata Durga Prasad was arrested by the Undi police as he tried to pour ink on ballot papers at the 32nd polling station in the village.   In East Godavari, polling was stopped for some time at a polling station located Sakurru village in Amalapuram as the ‘Glass’ symbol of Jana Sena party was not printed on the ballot paper. The problem was rectified and the polling was continued. A retired woman teacher Nrisimhadevara Simhachalam died while waiting for an auto-rickshaw to reach a polling station to cast her vote at Katrenikona. Police booked a case against a voter Kasi Venkata Ramana for taking a selfie with the ballot paper at a polling station at Pallamkurru village in Katrenikona mandal. The election authorities declared his vote as invalid.   In Vizianagaram district, polling was stopped in three stations in Anti Peta polling centre in Seethanagaram mandal as the voters found the name of YSR Congress dummy nominee Senapati Lakshmi in the ballot paper for MPTC polls though the official nominee was Senapati Nirmala. A repoll is likely to be held on Friday. Several adivasis in Visakhapatnam and other places faced a tough time to reach the polling stations for want of proper road connectivity. Hundreds of them crossed Matyasagedda in Arasu mandal to reach the polling stations. In Kurnool, two groups of voters entered into heated arguments at Devanakonda as some of them tried to resort to cross-voting. Police rushed to the spot and restored normalcy.   In Kadapa, at Utpativaripalle of Badvel mandal, YSR Congress supporters acted as agents at a polling station instead of TD activists, forcing the TD nominee Sirisha Reddy and the party agents to stage a protest. TD agents alleged that the signatures on the forms were not theirs. In Rajuvaripeta of Chapadu mandal, YSR Congress activists did not allow a TD agent to sit in the polling station. MPTC nominee Rajeshwari tried to disrupt the polling, forcing the police to take her into custody. In Guntur, TD activists from Gonepudi and Palapadu villages staged a protest in front of Narasaraopeta sub collector’s office, alleging that their polling agents were not being allowed to enter the polling stations by the YSR Congress leaders with the support from CI Krishnaiah.   The villagers from both the villages demanded a repoll and sought suspension of the CI.

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.  Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors.   In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.  The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing.   “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said. Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday. In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm.   Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162639", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17750", "source": "scrapy"},

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming  . BHG Holdings also reported a 40 to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods, to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours.   The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners. Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.  From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020. It stands at 10 per cent now.  Property tax rebates passed on by property owners have dried up. Although retail rent is expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.  Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm. Perhaps it also knows not keeping up risks losing loyal customers to competing malls.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/9068518/1957a42a2a1da80ba693669103d71585/sing-tien-foo-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Sing Tien Foo \">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162643", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "49262", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asianage.com:443", "section": "india", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asianage.com:443/india/politics/110421/mamata-accuses-shah-of-being-conspirator-behind-shooting-of-4-tmc-workers.html", "title": null, "author": "RAJIB CHOWDHURI", "author_link": "/byline/rajib-chowdhuri-1", "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Seeing herself losing the chair, Didi has stooped to such a low level, says Modi", "text": " Enraged by the killing of four Trinamul Congress workers by Central paramilitary forces in Coochbehar during the fourth phase of Assembly election in West Bengal on Saturday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused Union home minister Amit Shah of being a \"conspirator\" of the shooting and demanded his resignation.  Erupting in fury, Ms Banerjee told a TMC rally in North 24 Parganas, \"A dangerous incident has left me in pain.

Your violence after a decade-long misdeed cannot save you. People are casting their votes in large numbers for BJP. North Bengal has shown it.\"    Standing by the Central forces for their role in the poll duty, Mr Modi observed that the TMC chief, not the forces, has become the biggest trouble in the polls.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162643", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16894", "source": "scrapy"},

By stating he would no longer be head of the fourth-generation (4G) team of leaders in Government, Mr Heng has thrown the question of who will succeed PM Lee wide open yet again. Mr Heng, a career civil servant until he contested in the 2011 General Election (GE), had been chosen as the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) First Assistant Secretary-General in November 2018. In April 2019, he was appointed Singapore’s sole DPM, signifying that there had been a consensus among the 4G team that Mr Heng should lead them and the country. With these developments, Mr Heng, was in all senses, the PM-designate. He was even handed the task of Acting PM in the absence of PM Lee. When he brought his East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) to a slim victory after an 11th hour switch from his stronghold in Tampines GRC in GE2020, some were generous to say that he successfully held off a rout by the Workers’ Party. A second camp argued he had been wounded by his performance and wondered if the party might review his suitability as the nation’s next leader. They might think their instinct was right when Mr Heng said he was stepping aside for a new leader but he has also debunked this perceived link: “The results in the GE2020 performance, in particular, in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside,” he said at the media conference on Thursday. In response to DPM Heng’s announcement, the 4G leaders said in a statement on Thursday “this unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning”. Given that PM Lee also said he would be announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks’ time, the question arises: Why was it not possible to pair the announcements to give the assurance to citizens that there would be, nonetheless, forward momentum in the process of leadership renewal? Since PM Lee said there would be consequential shifts, would those whose political stocks rise – a second DPM, a new Minister for Finance or even a new Defence Minister, for instance, give indication of who the PAP might test as a replacement for Mr Heng. But whose choice would that be? While the two-week interregnum may cause the rumour mills to go into overdrive, can the matter of who the 4G leaders wish to select be settled quite so quickly? Should it? Having said that, if current Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is also Second Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP, were to be placed in the powerful Finance Minister role, it could be taken as a forgone conclusion that Mr Chan is next in line to succeed PM Lee. This would be the fastest way to resolve the succession question. Like Mr Heng, Mr Chan entered Government with the 2011 GE. He has held a few full ministerial portfolios but most unusually, has had a tour of duty outside of mainstream government as the country’s labour chief - Secretary-General at the National Trades Union Congress. He has also been developing his international exposure through a collaborative project between the Government and that of Chongqing province in the People’s Republic of China. His previous incarnation as a Major-General and Chief of Army in the Singapore Armed Forces will have afforded him defence networks in the region and also in the United States where he was the first foreign graduate to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award by the prestigious Army Command and General Staff College. In his current portfolio as Industry and Trade Minister during the pandemic, Minister Chan has worked overtime to secure multilateral trade arrangements and ensure that international trade lines remain open. However, at Thursday’s press conference on Mr Heng’s announcement, Mr Chan and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung - another 4G member touted to be a contender for the premiership - said that the 4G team will need time to consider afresh and “holistically” who might be most suited to be the “captain of the team” using Ong’s preferred metaphor.  In other words, the most obvious choice may not be the answer. What is at stake here? The deleterious public health and economic effects of COVID-19, Mr Heng, explained, would require several years to recede.  PM Lee has also previously acknowledged this while assuring Singaporeans that he will see Singapore through the current crisis and is “determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team”. If he only took over as premier then, Mr Heng would already be in his mid-60s. Sixty-five, we know, is the age when Singapore’s first PM Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to stand down and also two years older than when its second PM, Goh Chok Tong, transferred premiership to the current PM.  This would not have given Mr Heng a long enough runway to govern before the handover to the next leader is expected. This cycle of leadership succession would have started again all too soon. Precious time has been lost to the pandemic since the PM-in-waiting was also limited in his ability to travel overseas to strengthen his standing in the international community. From the disruptions that emanate from US-China relations and the domestic political instability within some of our Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncertainty about how ASEAN can continue to provide ballast for peace, stability and security in the region, which Singapore relies on, is something PM Lee’s successor must be prepared to address.  This person must have a certain level of exposure and experience in operating on that plane. In that regard, the two former Principal Private Secretaries to the current PM, Mr Ong and Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who are on the other hand 51 and 48 years old respectively, may also have some help to draw upon.  They can ride on the networks they have built from that role as well as the tutelage of the current PM - much like Mr Heng could, given that he played the same role to Singapore’s first PM. The advantage might go to Mr Wong, who has built a high and favourable public profile as co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 and clearly has the confidence of DPM Heng, serving as the latter’s Second Minister of Finance since August 2016. If on the other hand, the 4G privileges a leader’s standing domestically and more importantly, his or her ability to motivate to inspire peers and citizens, the people-oriented Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at 44 years of age may be given more time to prove himself. Ironically, this process of readying these individuals and testing the dynamics among the 4G leaders without Mr Heng in the picture will indeed take time. The next PAP Conference and GE may even be needed as barometers of support among cadres and citizens. With PM Lee to provide the firm and steady leadership through the severe and immediate COVID-19 challenge, the best way forward is to take a step back to watch how these candidates continue to interact with Singaporeans, their international counterparts and each other before a new successor is announced.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/10586236/bf96a54634b0637b0f830fbf41a3019f/gillian-koh-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Koh\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162643", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48791", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.thedailystar.net", "section": "", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/news/sun-baked-fun-and-picnics-2072729", "title": "Sun baked fun and picnics", "author": "Home", "author_link": "", "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "On the contrary, a little bit innovation from our ends could turn things around.

After all, isn't this what the pandemic has taught us? That we can, and must work with whatever options we are given. Yes, we are speaking about an easy alternative, such as the replica-grass laden veranda, or the hand-crafted rug placed over the concrete on the rooftop. We can have our mini picnics right at these spots, at the comfort of our very homes, with our loved ones around. A mini basket full of home-baked goodies, fresh fruits and lots of iced tea would enhance our experience. To this, we can add calm retro music or some soothing jazz tunes, especially to match the mood of the afternoon. Few scrambled ideas for the entire day could be to turn the environment into a mini courtyard fit for the queen and the king. Strings of paper lanterns can be used as decorative elements, a splurge can be made out of cushy pillows, decorative furs and a karaoke microphone for singing out loud our favourite tracks.                             At Star Lifestyle, we never miss out on the fashion and the styling suggestions, which we believe, is one of the most integral part of any get-together. This year, try wearing pure-cotton dresses in check prints or the plain khadi for these 'stay-at-home' picnics. Indigo tie-dyes also look brilliant when aesthetically imprinted over the ivory white dress. Make sure you wear a fashionable hat or a matching scarf to match the sensibility of the occasion. Both kitten heels and flats go wonderfully well with the occasion and the loose — flowy, pure  cottons that we suggest you should be wearing. If an occasional pigeon comes now and then, to enjoy your picnic alongside your immediate family, consider your hard-work a success.   \n", "image_url": "<img class=\"image-style-very-big-1\" src=\"https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/feature/images/2021/04/06/picnic0.jpg?itok=txOdhFGb\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162644", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "17367", "source": "scrapy"},

It also comes as an opportunity for those seeking to make a shift toward healthier living. Well, why not start today! As per World Health Organisation (WHO), this year's  World Health Day theme is 'Building a fairer, healthier world'.  Stating that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the countries hard, WHO mentioned that ours is an unequal world where \"some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income...little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services.\" WHO urged leaders around the world to \"monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.\" And while people across the globe are still struggling to come to terms with how much life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a U.K.-based price comparison website Money.co.uk has come out with a list of the world’s healthiest countries in 2021. The publications release this list every year and this time too it has been published on World Health Day.  The publication mentioned that their mortgage experts rank the healthiest countries and cities in the world on the basis of \"good food, good company and good transport links\". Additionally, conditions like air quality, pollution levels, cost of living, life expectancy among other things are taken into consideration.  Below is the list of the top 5 world's healthiest countries. According to the report, Spain is the healthiest country in the world. It mentioned a few reasons such as their Mediterranean lifestyle, walking as a mode of transport, which helps to lower deaths caused by pollution, cost of living is moderate among other things why the country topped their list.  l: As per the report, Portugal bagged the second spot on the list of the world's healthiest countries. Their high-ranking healthcare system is the reason why the country has achieved good rankings in several health indices over the years, including this one.  Switzerland is home to one of the happiest populations. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum's 2013 Human Capital Report, Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world.  Home to the oldest living population in the world, Japan obviously has one of the highest life expectancies in the world! Other factors that contribute to Japan being in the top five are: their smaller portion sizes and protein-dense diet, their notoriously fast transportation, walking as the preferred mode of transportation and high cost of living matched with the price among other things.   Good healthcare system, healthy diet and clean water among other things such as low levels of smoking, makes Iceland one of the world's healthiest countries to live in. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162643", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34613", "source": "scrapy"},

Zhao Wei, sanctioned as the leader of a “transnational criminal organization” by the U.S. Treasury, owns the Dok Ngiew Kham Group, and is co-owner of the Kings Romans International (HK) Co., Limited, which operates the Kings Romans Casino in Laos’ Golden Triangle SEZ. He is said to hold de facto control of the SEZ, which caters mainly to Chinese tourists. Zhao visited southern Laos’ Saravan province on March 27 to meet with Gov. Phoxay Xayasone to discuss the possibility of developing an airport and investing in several agricultural and tourism development projects, offcials said. The governor took him to see a large plot of land in Saravan’s Ta-Oey district, available for farming, raising livestock or building tourist attractions. Zhao saw pieces of land in Saravan’s Samoey district, which borders Vietnam to the east, where he likely plans to build a road. Officials from Saravan province confirmed Zhao’s visit in comments to RFA’s Lao Service March 31. “Mr. Zhao Wei met with the provincial governor then went to conduct a land survey in Samoy district… He’s looking to possibly invest in agricultural development,” said an official who requested anonymity to speak freely. Another official told RFA that Zhao came with land surveyors in tow. “They conducted a survey on a stretch of land near the Lao-Vietnamese border to plant commercial trees. They were just looking around, they don’t have a specific plan to do anything yet,” said the second official, who requested anonymity for professional reasons. A farmer in Ta-Oey district told RFA that Chinese agricultural development projects are worrisome, for pollution and commercial reasons. “The Chinese will use a lot of chemicals, and that’s harmful to the environment. The chemicals will also make their produce look better than ours and will bring down prices,” the farmer said. Zhao’s company is currently engaged in a feasibility study on a similar project in northern Laos’ Xieng Khouang province. The company looked at a piece of land in Pek district near the Plain of Jars, a major archaeological landscape and UNESCO World Heritage Site consisting of thousands of large prehistoric stone containers scattered about the area. “Zhao Wei visited here in August last year. He was looking for about 150 hectares of land for agricultural and tourist development that would include building hotels, raising cows and growing organic vegetables,” an official of the province’s Planning and Investment Department told RFA. “In May last year, Zhao Wei signed a MoU with the Lao government that allowed him to do a feasibility study on the 150-hectare land to develop a tourist attraction complex, a traditional medicine factory and a golf course. The central government gave permission to him to do the feasibility study because he has experience and money, but there’s no concession agreement yet,” said the official. The MoU states that the Dok Ngiew Kham Group will provide capital, technology and a market to local farmers to raise livestock and grow organic vegetables. The farmers will sell what they grow to Dok Ngiew Kham which will then export most of it to China. Local academics are concerned that the group has plans to turn the Plain of Jars into an attraction for tourists taking a break from the casino. “Chinese investments should be limited only to tourism because the Plain of Jars is one of Laos’ World Heritage Sites. It should be protected,” a Lao scholar told RFA. The jars are estimated to be 3,000 years old or older. “The project must not include a casino. Casinos bring a lot of problems like crime. They should only be allowed near border areas like in Bokeo and Savannakhet provinces,” said the scholar. Besides Saravan and Xieng Khouang, Zhao has explored a similar project in northeastern Laos’ Houaphanh province. In an August 2020 meeting with Houaphanh’s governor, Zhao said he wanted to build roads and tourist attractions in Houaphanh and invest in the area’s livestock industry. The Dok Ngiew Kham Group in 2017 cancelled a plan to build a U.S. $150 million international airport in the Golden Triangle SEZ. The group has reapplied for permission to pursue this plan, an RFA Lao Service source confirmed. RFA reported in October 2020 that the company had begun construction on a new port on the Mekong River to serve the SEZ. Zhao and then Deputy Prime Minister Bounthong Chitmany were present at the port’s groundbreaking ceremony on Oct. 3. In 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department declared the Zhao Wei network a “transnational criminal organization” (TCO) and imposed sanctions on Zhao and three other individuals and three companies across Laos, Thailand and Hong Kong. “Based in Laos within the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (GTSEZ), the Zhao Wei TCO exploits this region by engaging in drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, bribery, and wildlife trafficking, much of which is facilitated through the Kings Romans Casino located within the GTSEZ,” said a Treasury Department statement.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162642", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12848", "source": "scrapy"},

Facebook has been pounded with criticism that it not only hasn't done enough to curb misinformation and vitriol on its network, but that its algorithm actually tended to encourage such posts because of the attention they grab.   The social media giant will no longer recommend politics-themed groups to users, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday, making permanent a measure put in place during the combative US election won by President Joe Biden. The Silicon Valley-based internet giant is also working on ways to reduce the amount of political content served up in users' news feeds by its automated systems. \"We're still going to enable people to engage in political groups and discussions if they want to,\" Zuckerberg said. But he added the decision to reduce political content in users' main news feeds is part of a push \"to turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversation.\"   The social media giant has long been a fertile ground for users to tangle over opposing views or surround themselves with those who agree emphatically. \"But one of the top pieces of feedback that we are hearing from our community right now is that people don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services,\" Zuckerberg said in an earnings call. \"We plan to keep civic and political groups out of recommendations for the long term and we plan to expand that policy globally,\" he added. These moves come as Facebook wrangles with whether former president Donald Trump's suspension from the network for \"fomenting insurrection\" should stand.   Facebook and Instagram barred Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, an attack on the seat of US democracy that led to Trump's unprecedented second impeachment. The platform is referring the matter to its independent oversight board, which is tasked with making final decisions on appeals regarding what is removed or allowed to remain on the world's biggest social network. \"We believe our decision was necessary and right,\" Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg said in a blog post at the time. Members of the oversight board come from various countries and include jurists, human rights activists, journalists, a Nobel Peace laureate and a former Danish prime minister.   Reaction to the Trump ban has ranged from criticism that Facebook should have booted him long ago to outrage over his online voice being muted. Facebook's stance was never meant to mean \"that politicians can say whatever they like,\" Clegg said. Facebook updated its mission a few years ago, from connecting the world to \"bringing the world closer together.\" Letting people create groups devoted to topics, hobbies, ideas or interests was touted as enabling people to get to know one another in virtual clubhouses. More than 600 million of Facebook's approximately 2.6 billion monthly users take part in groups, according to Zuckerberg.   \"Our product focus now is to develop this community infrastructure beyond feeds and message boards to help people build and run full self-sustaining community institutions,\" he said. \"As we continue to focus on this, we need to make sure that the communities people connect with are healthy and positive.\" Part of that effort involves building tools such as messaging and video chat into groups, and creating ways for groups to raise money from donations, membership fees, or merchandise sales, according to the Facebook chief. It also means taking down groups that break Facebook rules about promoting violence or hate, Zuckerberg said, noting that the social network has removed more than a million groups for policy violations in the past year.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162643", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17285", "source": "scrapy"},

Some moments and memories are so special that all it takes is a small sensory cue to take one to a different timeline of one's life. This is often captured by the expression 'madeleine de proust' one of the key passages in Marcel Proust book 'In search of lost time' when a particular sight, smell, food, a song, or an experience unexpectedly unlocks a past recollection. For instance, the smell of jasmine flowers reminds me of my grandmother and how fondly she used to place them near her pillow. It's not uncommon when a simple song triggers a plethora of past memories. No wonder when sometimes I miss my mother near me, I try to do or make something exactly the way she does to intentionally create a madeleine moment and then soak myself in the nostalgia and priceless feelings associated with childhood memories. The reverse is also true. There are events or moments of life thinking about which can make one feel awful. It could be related to anything in the past like the unexpected loss of a loved one, changing dynamics of cherished relationships, emotionally taxing incidents or the struggles in the present moment that instantly makes one negative. Sometimes when a negative situation stays for too long, it can leave one overwhelmed in a way that the person seems to be addicted to negativity or develops a habit of ruminating. For instance, acting as a caregiver where hopes are not high, clinging to a toxic relationship or sticking with the wrong job because of one's helpless condition perceived or real. Rumination is continuously getting lost in a thought loop where you eventually end up thinking about that same negative or sad thought or experience. Why is it that we end up remembering what we want to forget? Perhaps negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that even when an individual has made a conscious thought to not pay heed to it, it keeps coming back. One of the reasons people ruminate is owing to the belief that by ruminating they will probably get an insight into their life or problem. However, it doesn't work out because in a state of ruminating the person is focused more on the problems and consequences instead of solutions. The person may perceive it as natural coping mechanism to adapt with the pain, but one has to ponder whether it's helping one solve a problem or just trapping back in an unhealthy thought cycle. Dwelling on negative thoughts and engaging in self-blame has been associated with mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Research by Peter Kinderman professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they had experienced many negative events in their lives. The question is how to intentionally forget things that only serve to disturb us. Can we exercise influence on our memory? Perhaps the easiest way to forget something is not revisiting it in your mind. There are many theories related to the process of motivated forgetting that suggest that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. According to Freud, memories that are likely to induce guilt, embarrassment, shame or anxiety are actively, but unconsciously, pushed out of consciousness as a form of ego defence. Unconscious or repressed memories are exceedingly difficult to retrieve but remain available. People may resort to 'repression' in which they subconsciously push unpleasant thoughts and feelings into their unconscious as an automatic defensive mechanism. Thought 'suppression' is also a  type of motivated forgetting when an individual consciously attempts to stop thinking about a particular thought. Memories are also forgotten through distortion as perGestalt theory of forgetting. This is also called false memory syndrome in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by false memories, recollections that are factually incorrect but yet are strongly believed. Rehearsing negative memories by ruminating over them only serve to strengthen them, so it's important to forget certain things to live life peacefully. Apparently, we may never forget things completely but when we stop thinking about them, it often fades away as we remember fewer facts. If rumination is affecting your personal growth stop and take notice of the circumstances and triggers that lead you to ruminate. Eliminating the trigger may not be possible always but by practicing mindfulness one can consciously try to respond with an element of awareness breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. This may require consistent practice and conscious efforts but it's important to check yourself lest negativity pulls you into a trap again. Finding a distraction like going for a walk, playing a game, calling a friend, watching a movie or getting engaged in any activity that breaks the chain can also be helpful. If constant rumination is disabling you and you are unable to focus your attention on other important things of life, seeking therapy can be beneficial. Otherwise meditating can also reduce rumination because it helps in de cluttering the mind to arrive at an emotionally calm state. Life is fleeting and made up of a collection of moments. Clinging on to negative experiences will only make us miss out on the beauty of 'now'.Next time if your answer to this question 'Do you remember what you want to forget?' carries away your mind to unpleasant memories and events, change the question itself. Ask yourself - 'Do you forget what you want to remember?' Answering it will not only break the thought cycle and distract your mind but transport you to all the beautiful memories and the blessings in the present moment, that perhaps money can't buy but fills the heart with gratitude.

Ocean Affairs Council Chair Lee Chung-wei told Taiwan’s legislature that the Taiwanese coastguard had recently identified Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating near Pratas, which sits about 170 nautical miles to the southeast of Hong Kong in the northern part of the South China Sea. Lee indicated that Taiwanese forces would open fire on UAVs that fly over the island, which is also claimed by the People’s Republic of China. “If we need to open fire, we will open fire,” Lee said, noting that the drones have thus far only circled Pratas and that similar activity has not been observed near Itu Aba — Taiwan’s base in the Spratly Islands which lie further south. Lee did not specify what kinds of drones China has been sending to Pratas. These drone flights, which Lee described as “gray zone” activity, come as China is ramping up pressure on Taiwan. Aircraft belonging to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been conducting regular flights through Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) for months on end, including through the southwestern portion of the ADIZ near Pratas, RFA reported in  . The Ministry of National Defense   a record 20 PLA aircraft entering Taiwan’s ADIZ on March 26. Jessica Drun, a non-resident fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, told RFA that “these gray zone activities are an attempt to wear down Taiwan psychologically and from a resource perspective.” “This is happening against the backdrop of ever-deepening U.S.-Taiwan ties, a domestic population in Taiwan that has more or less rejected China’s framework for cross-Strait relations, and an increasingly assertive Beijing the world over,” Drun said. Although Taiwan is a self-governing democracy, Beijing claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be annexed by force if it deems necessary. While the drones currently operating near Pratas are likely to be for reconnaissance or testing Taiwan’s resolve, PLA researchers have written about the possibility of using armed unmanned systems in combat scenarios that would involve Taiwan. For instance, PLA researchers have recently published studies on using unmanned surface vehicles, drone swarms and helicopter-like UAVs during amphibious landing operations, such as efforts to invade Taiwan or seize small islands like Pratas and Itu Aba. Michael Mazza, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that Pratas Island may be an “attractive target” for China. “China might one day wish to occupy the islands, either as a first step in an assault on Taiwan, as a means of coercing Taiwan into unification, as a way to test international responses to an attack on one of Taiwan's offshore islands, or as part of an effort to reenforce control over the South China Sea,” Mazza said. Taiwan and China are just two of the claimants in the disputed South China Sea. The others are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Even as China has been turning up the heat to assert its sweeping land and sea claims in the South China Sea and to pressure Taiwan, other militaries are making their presence known as well. A U.S. carrier strike group conducted a bilateral military exercise with the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) in the South China Sea on Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. Navy announced in press release. “The two days exercise aims to strengthen the bilateral relations and military diplomacy,\" the RMAF said in its own statement. The exercises are to \"enhance the operational interoperability and overall cooperation among the two forces,\" it added.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162645", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12648", "source": "scrapy"},

The move assumes significance as telcos are gearing up to leverage 5G as the next frontier for future growth to bolster revenues and provide stronger customer experience.   While the latest demonstration underscores the company's technology capabilities for rolling out of fifth-generation services in future, Airtel said the actual impact of 5G experience will be available to customers, \"when adequate spectrum is available and government approvals are received\". For the demo run, the company leveraged existing liberalised spectrum in the 1800 MHz band. \"In many ways now, it is a flick of a button to turn on 5G. It is important that we get the right 5G experience for which adequate spectrum in the right bands need to be made available. \"Today, we have conclusively demonstrated that as far as Airtel is concerned, we are 5G ready,\" Bharti Airtel MD and CEO Gopal Vittal said at a virtual conference.   The company said Airtel 5G is capable of delivering 10x speeds, 10x latency and 100x concurrency when compared to existing technologies. Specifically, in Hyderabad, users were able to download a full-length movie in a matter of seconds on a 5G phone. Using dynamic spectrum sharing, Airtel seamlessly operated 5G and 4G concurrently within the same spectrum block. The company said its demonstration has validated the 5G readiness of Airtel's network across all domains -- radio, core and transport. \"Every single part of our network is now fully 5G ready...and can use any spectrum band to click on 5G experience in a matter of months,\" Vittal said.   Airtel said it is committed to position India as a global innovation hub that is at the forefront of tech revolution. India has the potential to become a global hub for 5G innovation, Vittal said, adding this would require the coming together of ecosystem -- applications, devices and network innovation. \"We are more than ready to do our bit,\" he emphasised. Airtel said it is the first operator to demonstrate this capability. The company had already demonstrated 5G capabilities in labs, where on a standalone mode it was able to deliver experiences of up to 3 Gbps. \"We are excited, as this has been demonstrated over a commercial network...The moment we receive Government approvals and we have the right spectrum bands in adequate quantities, we will be able to roll this out, immediately.   \"Even on existing bands of spectrum, 5G can be turned on but the full power of the experience will be felt only when adequate spectrum is available from the Government,\" Vittal said. The company does not see any significant change in its capex cycle going forward. Telecom companies are eagerly looking to tap the upcoming 5G opportunities in the India, a lucrative market that has second largest number of telephone connections in the world. Reliance Jio has said it will continue to accelerate the rollout of its digital platforms and indigenously developed next-generation 5G stack. The company had said it will make 5G affordable and available everywhere, adding that its 5G service would be a testimony to the vision of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat'.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162646", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16851", "source": "scrapy"},

Under-60s can still decide to take the vaccine but only following \"consultation with the doctor carrying out the vaccination ... and with an individual risk analysis,\" said ministers of Germany's 16 states as well as the federal health minister in a policy statement.   The World Health Organization and the EU's health watchdog have both deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine safe, but several countries have restricted its use over clotting fears. Chancellor Angela Merkel noted that experts have recorded in recent weeks \"very rare but very serious cases of thrombosis\" in people vaccinated with AstraZeneca. \"They are findings that (Germany's vaccine commission) and finally us, cannot ignore,\" she said. Germany's vaccine commission known as STIKO earlier Tuesday recommended that use of the jabs be halted for under-60s because of \"currently available data on the occurrence of rare but very severe thromboembolic side effects\" in younger vaccinated people.   It intends to make another recommendation by the end of April on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received a first dose of the vaccine, it said. Pending this decision, ministers said people who are due for their second jab can either choose to take it if cleared by their attending doctor, or they can opt to wait for the commission to make its recommendation. The latest restrictions amounted to a new setback for the vaccine developed by the Anglo-Swedish laboratory. Nevertheless Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany would be able to meet its goal of offering every adult a coronavirus jab by the end of the summer.   Just after it received approval from European regulator EMA for use in the bloc, Germany restricted the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s because of insufficient data. After clearing it for older people subsequently, Germany along with several EU nations suspended its use again in mid-March because of clotting fears. Just over a week after allowing its use again, German authorities have now again halted its use among younger people. Merkel insisted however that it is such careful consideration and transparency that can keep the public's confidence in the vaccine.   \"Trust stems from the knowledge that every suspicion, every individual case will be examined,\" she said. The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people. Germany's medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday. Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week.   On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s \"pending further analysis\". The AstraZeneca vaccine has had something of a rollercoaster ride. Britain, which developed it, staunchly supports its use, South Africa has rejected it outright. France has limited its use to over-55s, while Spain has done the same for under-65s. Germany's vaccination campaign has been sluggish, with official figures showing around 11 percent of the population have received a first dose so far.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162647", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17687", "source": "scrapy"},

Taiwan's military responded by scrambling planes to monitor the Chinese aircraft, issuing radio warnings and mobilizing air defense systems until the aircraft left the area, its ministry of defense said. Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu warned on Wednesday that the country would fight \"to the very last day,\" if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has never controlled Taiwan, were to invade. \"From my limited understanding of American decision makers watching developments in this region, they clearly see the danger of the possibility of China launching an attack against Taiwan,\" he told reporters. \"We are willing to defend ourselves without any questions and we will fight the war if we need to fight the war. And if we need to defend ourselves to the very last day we will defend ourselves to the very last day,\" Wu said. Meanwhile, the USS John S. McCain (DDG 56), an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, conducted \"a routine Taiwan Strait transit April 7 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law,\" the U.S. 7th Fleet said in a statement. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the move wasn't in response to \"specific events or actions,\" but rather to demonstrate its commitment to the freedom of all nations to \"sail, operate and fly in accordance with international law.\" China hit out at the United States for \"endangering the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.\" CCP leader Xi Jinping has told the country's military and armed police force to get 'combat ready' to defend national sovereignty and security, amid fears that Beijing may be planning an invasion of democratic Taiwan in the next few years. Gaining control over Taiwan has been highlighted as a core goal of Xi's \"national rejuvenation program\" by 2035, with some analysts saying Beijing will likely make its first move in the next few years. The top U.S. military commander in the region has warned that China could be preparing to bring forward plans to invade Taiwan as early as 2027. Admiral Philip Davidson, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Beijing could launch an invasion within the next six years. The PLA has flown multiple aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ since the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20. The ADIZ was created by the United States Armed Forces after World War II, and covers most of the Taiwan Strait, part of the East China Sea, and adjacent airspace. Not mentioned in or regulated by any international agreement, the zones extend far beyond territorial airspace and are designed to give a country more time to respond to potentially hostile aircraft. Taiwan's defense ministry said recent incursions have included bombers and fast-moving fighter jets usually used for offensive purposes. In 2018, the Pentagon warned that the PLA is gradually preparing for a possible invasion of Taiwan, as the CCP \"continued to develop and deploy increasingly advanced military capabilities intended to coerce Taiwan, signal Chinese resolve, and gradually improve capabilities for an invasion.\" Taiwan has never been ruled by Beijing nor formed part of the People's Republic of China, but has been locked out of international diplomacy and agencies at the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s insistence. Washington has said it will no longer seek to \"appease\" China on Taiwan, as the State Department announced an end to a ban on high-level official and diplomatic contact with Taiwanese officials on Jan. 9, at the tail end of the Trump administration. Under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, China has stepped up its rhetoric claiming the island as part of its territory, and has refused to rule out a military invasion. But Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly said that the country's 23 million people have no wish to give up their sovereignty or their democratic way of life.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162647", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12856", "source": "scrapy"},

Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a military crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup.   The junta's violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar's myriad ethnic armed groups. The US State Department said it was ordering the departure of \"non-emergency US government employees and their family members\". The decision was taken to protect the safety and security of staff and their families, the State Department said. World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta cadres with sanctions. But the pressure has not swayed the generals. Saturday, the annual Armed Forces Day, saw the biggest loss of life so far, with at least 107 people killed.   The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar's 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions. Three of them -- the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army (AA) -- on Tuesday threatened to join protesters' fight unless the military reined in its crackdown. While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days.   A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible. The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes. Further strikes were launched on Tuesday, but Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU's head of foreign affairs, said the group would continue its position of \"strongly supporting people's movement against (the) military coup\". The KNU's Fifth Brigade put out a statement on Tuesday condemning the air strikes and warning it had no option but to \"confront these serious threats\" posed by the military.   Around 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes. The Thai foreign ministry said late Tuesday about 2,300 have returned to Myanmar, while about 550 remain in Thailand. Karen activists have accused the Thai authorities of pushing people back and accused them of blocking UN refugee officials from the area. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha insisted that there was \"no influx\" of refugees and that the kingdom's authorities had not \"scared them off with guns or sticks\".   Some Karen people injured in the weekend strikes sought medical treatment Tuesday on the Thai side of the border -- the most serious case was a 15-year-old with a collapsed lung and broken rib. Thai police said they had intercepted 10 parcels containing 112 grenades and 6,000 rounds of ammunition in northern Chiang Rai province that had been destined for Myanmar's notorious border town Tachileik. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Myanmar on Wednesday, requested by former colonial power Britain.

For weeks, the Philippine government has engaged in a verbal tussle with Beijing and lodged diplomatic protests over the presence of dozens of Chinese ships in contested waters of the sea, but China has denied the allegations and said these are fishing vessels. “The U.S. admonition to China against the use of force on Philippine public vessels and aircraft, which are performing their constitutional mandate to protect and defend Philippine rights in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, is an additional affirmation of the long-standing partnership between our two countries,” said Arsenio Andolong, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of National Defense.  “As the situation in the West Philippine Sea evolves, we keep all our options open in managing the situation, including leveraging our partnerships with other nations such as the United States,” Andolong said, referring to the section of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines.  A day earlier, the U.S. State Department reiterated that Washington was backing its longtime Asian ally – a former American colony – in the ongoing dispute over the Chinese ships moored at Whitsun Reef, which lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and other disputed waters in the Spratly Islands. “As we have stated before, an armed attack against the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, will trigger our obligations under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty,” Ned Price, the department’s spokesman, told a daily press briefing in response to a reporter’s question. Under the auspices of the 70-year-old treaty, the armed forces of the United States and the Philippines will come to each other’s military aid in the event of an external attack on one of them.  Despite repeated calls by Manila for the ships to leave the area and the filing of diplomatic protests, the Chinese vessels have lingered there.  Last week, the Philippine military said dozens of Chinese militia ships were scattered among contested reefs and islets in the Philippine EEZ.  China’s foreign ministry has insisted the area around Whitsun Reef belongs to Beijing. “The Philippines attempts to use an illegal, null-and-void award to negate China’s sovereignty, rights and interests, negate Chinese fishermen’s fishing history and rights in their traditional fishing grounds,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a press briefing on Tuesday. “We hope the Philippines will look at this objectively and correctly, immediately stop wanton hype … and avoid casting negative influence on bilateral relations and the overall peace and stability in the South China Sea,” he said. The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond on Thursday to the Philippine and U.S. statements. Beijing insists much of the South China Sea is its territory, despite a July 2016 international arbitral ruling by a United Nations-backed tribunal that affirmed the Philippines’ EEZ. Other governments claiming parts of the South China Sea are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Although Indonesia does not consider itself a claimant in the territorial disputes, China claims historic rights that overlap with Indonesia’s EEZ.  Since Monday the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has filed daily protests against China about the ships in its EEZ. On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. again demanded that all the Chinese ships move out.  “Nobody fishes by lashing ships together. Last time that was done was the Persian invasion of Greece recorded by Herodotus,” Locsin said in a Twitter post late Wednesday. “We’ve seen that movie.” The Chinese presence in the Philippine EEZ also has Manila counting on its Visiting Forces Agreement with Washington, which President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to terminate. In February, Lloyd Austin, the defense chief in the new Biden Administration, reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to the 1999 VFA and the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty during his first official phone call with his Philippine counterpart, Delfin Lorenzana. The VFA, which allows the presence of U.S. troops in the Philippines, has remained in effect since Manila deferred its termination.  The pact is also the basis for another defense cooperation agreement, which allows U.S. troops to pre-position assets at certain Philippine military bases.  “We are continuously in talks with the U.S. on the matter of mutual defense,” Andolong said Thursday.  “Both parties are committed to undertake their obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty so that neither stands alone in these issues involving the two states’ inherent right of self-defense, individually and collectively,” he said.  The U.S., meanwhile, has maintained naval patrols in the South China Sea. On Sunday, the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group entered the waterway to carry out maritime strike exercises, anti-submarine operations, coordinated tactical training, and other activities, according to the U.S. Navy.  On Wednesday, the Royal Malaysian Air Force announced it had completed a two-day bilateral military exercise in the sea with the Roosevelt strike group.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"210408-PH-CH-US-defense-inside.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/philippine/210408-ph-ch-us-defense-inside.jpg\" title=\"210408-PH-CH-US-defense-inside.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162647", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13170", "source": "scrapy"},

Amidst a national lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery.   On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American's lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US. Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31. He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.   The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country. No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday mid-night, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House will not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday.   Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban. I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today, Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden. The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work  and millions more desperate to make ends meet  now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources, he wrote.   In his letter, Hawley wrote that the unemployment rate remains at 6.2 per cent  with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis  and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions, he said. In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers.   I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programmes to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm, Hawley added.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162647", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17476", "source": "scrapy"},

Previously, too, the government had ordered Twitter to take down handles and hashtags that suggested a farmer genocide was being planned, saying such misinformation and inflammatory content will incite passion, and impact public order.   It has also warned Twitter of penal action in case of failure to comply with its directive and had cited sections that provide for fine and jail for up to 7 years.

Law, 27, tweeted earlier this week that he had been approved as a political asylum-seeker by the Home Office following a series of intervies over four months. The Hong Kong government said on Friday that it opposed the \"harboring of criminals\" by other countries, regions, organizations, or individuals. Apparently dispensing with Hong Kong's rule-of-law principle that the accused are presumed innocent until proven guilty, it said \"criminals [were alleging] that they were prosecuted for political reasons to deliberately escape justice.\" \"Any country, region, organisation or individual that harbours Hong Kong criminals in any form shows contempt for the rule of law, grossly disrespects Hong Kong's legal systems and barbarically interferes in the affairs of Hong Kong,\" it said, in comments closely resembling those made by a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing on Thursday.  \"They shall eventually bear the consequences of what they have done,\" it said. Beijing on Thursday accused the U.K. of \"harboring criminals\" after Law's asylum status was confirmed. \"The UK is clearly a platform for Hong Kong independence agitators, and provides so-called shelter for wanted criminals,\" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing in Beijing. \"The UK should immediately correct its mistake, and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs,\" Zhao said. Law said it was precisely the fact that he was wanted under the draconian national security law, that was imposed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Hong Kong from July 1, 2020, that led to his being considered at risk by the British government. \"The fact that I am wanted under the National Security Law shows that I am exposed to severe political persecution and am unlikely to return to Hong Kong without risk,\" Law wrote, citing the decision letter he received from the Home Office. He also called on the Home Office to consider accepting a broader range of evidence for Hong Kong applications. Amnesty International said the national security law had \"greatly restrict[ed] freedom of expression and other human rights in the city.\" \"The chilling effect of the NSL on Hong Kong civil society has been rapid and deeply disturbing,\" the report, issued by the Hong Kong branch of the London-based rights group, said. Two days after the law was passed, the Hong Kong government declared that the 2019 protest slogan 'Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!\" constituted an offense under clauses in the law banning pro-secessionist words and deeds, the report said. \"Individuals and businesses that had shown support for the 2019 protest movement deleted their social media posts and accounts for fear of retaliation from the authorities,\" it said. The law granted sweeping new investigatory powers to police, including the power to impose travel bans, to search people's homes, to freeze or seize their assets, and to place them under surveillance without a court order, the report said. Authorities in Hong Kong ruled on Friday that Tam Tak-chi, the detained vice chairman of the opposition party People Power, could be tried for sedition in the District Court, with no jury, despite arguments from his defense team that the court would have no jurisdiction in national security cases. Tam was arrested in September 2020 for using the protest slogans \"Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!\" and \"Five demands, not one less!\" while giving speeches on the streets of Kowloon between March and July.  Tam is also accused of shouting: \"Dirty cops, hope your family members all die!\" and of making complaints relating to police inaction during a July 21, 2019 mob attack on train passengers in Yuen Long, and to riot police attacks on passengers in Prince Edward MTR station on Aug. 31, 2019.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162647", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12529", "source": "scrapy"},

Media reports indicated that the child was given booze by his family. Videos of the incident have been making rounds across social media. With the coronavirus death toll increasing everyday across the globe, many people have slipped into panic mode.  In the recent weeks, over 200 people have died in Iran after drinking alcohol. Most people procured the alcohol from bootleggers who dilute the alcohol and mix additives in it, which can have life-threatening reactions. In the video, a medical professional standing by the child’s bed can be heard claiming that the family had given the alcohol to him as a protective measure against coronavirus. Additionally, the doctor said that the child can no longer see and is in a coma. “I beg of you, do not give alcohol to your children. It is very dangerous,” he added. Due to the ban on alcohol in Iran, people are forced to make their alcohol or to buy it from bootleggers through illegal channels, which makes it very dangerous to consume. The ban was enforced in Iran starting 1979 but people prefer to resort to making alcohol at home. However, the homemade variants of alcohol have an extremely lethal concentration of methanol. Others drink industrial alcohol that comes in fruit flavours and is easily available across supermarkets. However, industrial alcohol is used as an alternative fuel soerce and as a pesticide, with high concentrations of methanol.

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162652", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47703", "source": "scrapy"},

Authorities in the central Chinese province of Hunan are believed to have secretly tried and jailed three non-governmental organization (NGO) workers, Cheng Yuan, Liu Dazhi, and Wuge Jianxiong, for \"subversion of state power\" in September after holding them incommunicado for nearly 18 months. Cheng's wife Shi Minglei arrived in the U.S. with the couple's daughter on April 7, with the help of the Christian rights group ChinaAid.  Shortly after landing, Shi tweeted: \"Cheng Yuan's wife and daughter are free!\" \"Easter has just ended, and we have said goodbye to darkness ... and brought me and our five-year-old daughter to freedom, with the help of ChinaAid,\" she wrote. Shi told RFA after her arrival that she still has no documentation to show that Cheng and the others have indeed been tried or sentenced. \"They acted illegally at every stage of the case,\" she said. \"From the persecution of the family members following Cheng's arrest, to the later stages when the case had been sent to court.\" \"That has to be the reason that the authorities haven't made any details of the case public so far.\" The three defendants have been denied meetings with attorneys hired by their families since being detained on July 22, 2019. The lawyers were told in March 2020 that the defenders had \"dismissed\" them and that the government had assigned them government-funded lawyers. But the families said they believe that the lawyers were fired under duress, and said they have had no contact with the government-appointed lawyers. For now, Shi said she was relieved to be beyond the reach of the state security police. \"It wasn't easy for us to get to the United States,\" she said. \"I am very grateful that my daughter is now free, and that we can't be used as hostages, or as a way to threaten Cheng Yuan.\" Changsha Funeng co-founder Yang Zhanqing, who now lives in the U.S., said the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) often uses political cases involving public dissent or rights activism to make an example of its critics. The fact that they are not doing that in this case suggests that even the authorities can't believe in the charges against the Changsha Three. \"I'm guessing there is no evidence at all, and no legal basis at all [for bringing this case],\" Yang told RFA. \"It's purely a form of official retaliation.\" Yang had earlier said that the three men were targeted because their rights work had received overseas funding, which the ruling Chinese Communist Party regards as \"collusion with hostile foreign forces,\" and a threat to its national security. Last year, San Francisco district supervisor Gordon Mar called in a letter to the city's mayor for the city administration to rethink its twinning ties to Changsha following the treatment meted out to the Changsha Three. In a Dec. 24 letter to San Francisco mayor London Breed, Mar called on the city authorities to reconsider the twinning arrangement with Changsha, and for a letter to be sent to her Chinese counterpart Zheng Jianxin calling for the trio's release.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162652", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12031", "source": "scrapy"},

The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Khan on Thursday rejected the proposal of the high-powered committee to import cotton from India, with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserting that there can be no normalisation of ties until New Delhi reverses its decision in 2019 to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.   Pakistan's U-turn on Thursday came a day after the ECC, under newly-appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, recommended importing cotton and sugar from India, lifting a nearly two-year-long ban on its import from the neighbouring country amidst tensions over the Kashmir issue. India has said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility, and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility. India has also told Pakistan that talks and terror cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.   The ECC's decision had raised hopes of a partial revival of Pakistan-India bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on the import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. India's move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162652", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17428", "source": "scrapy"},

For Hyderabad-based Sabista Khan, the name is synonymous with both dreams coming true and shoes. Her label ‘The Cinderella Story’ offers a wide variety of jutties not just to go with ethnic Indian clothes, but also quirky ones that go well with western outfits. Many Bollywood actresses, especially Kriti Sanon, Soha Ali Khan, Diana Penty, Manisha Koirala and Rhea Kapoor are quite often been seen sporting the brand. \r\nTalking about her initial days and how she entered the shoe business, Sabista says, “I had moved to Hyderabad from Mumbai in 2015 and was initially interested in designing clothes. But after doing some research I found that there are lots of fashion designers in Hyderabad. I next thought of bringing out belts and bags, before settling for shoes.” \r\nSabista says initially, they were curating and reselling footwear from across the country, bringing them under one label for various pop up exhibitions. “Soon we got a lot of requests for jutties. But we wanted to design our jutties instead of curating them. Reselling didn’t satisfy my creative urge; so then I started researching and travelling to learn about jutties,” she shares.   \r\nSabista was working in corporate communications and as a content writer till 2018, before diving into her business. “I ordered and studied about jutties to understand the issues. Fit was an issue, as some people have broad feet and jutties have a closed front. I wanted everyone to be comfortable wearing our jutties. Comfort first then style. So we treated the leather to not bite,” she explains. From February to April 2019, Sabista did a mock run and went live in April. “Lot of stylists took note of our work and included our footwear in celebrity styling and photo shoots. “Sobhita Dhulipala was the first celebrity to use one of my creations. It was for a teaser shoot of the Made in Heaven web series. I saw the teaser on my television, noticed the footwear and was completely ecstatic. The stylist had not shown me the shoot photos earlier. It was an amazing feeling,” reminiscences Sabista.   \r\nAll said and done, the two-year journey has been a roller coaster ride for Sabista.  The pandemic made 2020 a low period. “We were taking it slow post lockdown too, but social media helped us a lot in promoting our work,” she says. “There was immense personal growth; people took note of our work. It has been an amazing journey,” she adds. Sabista highlights the fact that technology helped her sail through the crisis. Sabista is now diversifying into sliders and mules, perfect for day-to-night look transitions. “The latest collection will have 13 pieces and will go live in May,” she announces.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162652", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16168", "source": "scrapy"},

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162653", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45260", "source": "scrapy"},

By stating he would no longer be head of the fourth-generation (4G) team of leaders in Government, Mr Heng has thrown the question of who will succeed PM Lee wide open yet again. Mr Heng, a career civil servant until he contested in the 2011 General Election (GE), had been chosen as the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) First Assistant Secretary-General in November 2018. In April 2019, he was appointed Singapore’s sole DPM, signifying that there had been a consensus among the 4G team that Mr Heng should lead them and the country. With these developments, Mr Heng, was in all senses, the PM-designate. He was even handed the task of Acting PM in the absence of PM Lee. When he brought his East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) to a slim victory after an 11th hour switch from his stronghold in Tampines GRC in GE2020, some were generous to say that he successfully held off a rout by the Workers’ Party. A second camp argued he had been wounded by his performance and wondered if the party might review his suitability as the nation’s next leader. They might think their instinct was right when Mr Heng said he was stepping aside for a new leader but he has also debunked this perceived link: “The results in the GE2020 performance, in particular, in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside,” he said at the media conference on Thursday. In response to DPM Heng’s announcement, the 4G leaders said in a statement on Thursday “this unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning”. Given that PM Lee also said he would be announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks’ time, the question arises: Why was it not possible to pair the announcements to give the assurance to citizens that there would be, nonetheless, forward momentum in the process of leadership renewal? Since PM Lee said there would be consequential shifts, would those whose political stocks rise – a second DPM, a new Minister for Finance or even a new Defence Minister, for instance, give indication of who the PAP might test as a replacement for Mr Heng. But whose choice would that be? While the two-week interregnum may cause the rumour mills to go into overdrive, can the matter of who the 4G leaders wish to select be settled quite so quickly? Should it? Having said that, if current Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is also Second Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP, were to be placed in the powerful Finance Minister role, it could be taken as a forgone conclusion that Mr Chan is next in line to succeed PM Lee. This would be the fastest way to resolve the succession question. Like Mr Heng, Mr Chan entered Government with the 2011 GE. He has held a few full ministerial portfolios but most unusually, has had a tour of duty outside of mainstream government as the country’s labour chief - Secretary-General at the National Trades Union Congress. He has also been developing his international exposure through a collaborative project between the Government and that of Chongqing province in the People’s Republic of China. His previous incarnation as a Major-General and Chief of Army in the Singapore Armed Forces will have afforded him defence networks in the region and also in the United States where he was the first foreign graduate to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award by the prestigious Army Command and General Staff College. In his current portfolio as Industry and Trade Minister during the pandemic, Minister Chan has worked overtime to secure multilateral trade arrangements and ensure that international trade lines remain open. However, at Thursday’s press conference on Mr Heng’s announcement, Mr Chan and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung - another 4G member touted to be a contender for the premiership - said that the 4G team will need time to consider afresh and “holistically” who might be most suited to be the “captain of the team” using Ong’s preferred metaphor.  In other words, the most obvious choice may not be the answer. What is at stake here? The deleterious public health and economic effects of COVID-19, Mr Heng, explained, would require several years to recede.  PM Lee has also previously acknowledged this while assuring Singaporeans that he will see Singapore through the current crisis and is “determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team”. If he only took over as premier then, Mr Heng would already be in his mid-60s. Sixty-five, we know, is the age when Singapore’s first PM Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to stand down and also two years older than when its second PM, Goh Chok Tong, transferred premiership to the current PM.  This would not have given Mr Heng a long enough runway to govern before the handover to the next leader is expected. This cycle of leadership succession would have started again all too soon. Precious time has been lost to the pandemic since the PM-in-waiting was also limited in his ability to travel overseas to strengthen his standing in the international community. From the disruptions that emanate from US-China relations and the domestic political instability within some of our Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncertainty about how ASEAN can continue to provide ballast for peace, stability and security in the region, which Singapore relies on, is something PM Lee’s successor must be prepared to address.  This person must have a certain level of exposure and experience in operating on that plane. In that regard, the two former Principal Private Secretaries to the current PM, Mr Ong and Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who are on the other hand 51 and 48 years old respectively, may also have some help to draw upon.  They can ride on the networks they have built from that role as well as the tutelage of the current PM - much like Mr Heng could, given that he played the same role to Singapore’s first PM. The advantage might go to Mr Wong, who has built a high and favourable public profile as co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 and clearly has the confidence of DPM Heng, serving as the latter’s Second Minister of Finance since August 2016. If on the other hand, the 4G privileges a leader’s standing domestically and more importantly, his or her ability to motivate to inspire peers and citizens, the people-oriented Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at 44 years of age may be given more time to prove himself. Ironically, this process of readying these individuals and testing the dynamics among the 4G leaders without Mr Heng in the picture will indeed take time. The next PAP Conference and GE may even be needed as barometers of support among cadres and citizens. With PM Lee to provide the firm and steady leadership through the severe and immediate COVID-19 challenge, the best way forward is to take a step back to watch how these candidates continue to interact with Singaporeans, their international counterparts and each other before a new successor is announced.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/10586236/bf96a54634b0637b0f830fbf41a3019f/gillian-koh-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Koh\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162653", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48791", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.wionews.com", "section": "WORLD", "sub_section": "Central Asia", "article_url": "https://www.wionews.com/world/not-the-chinese-virus-or-wuhan-virus-only-coronavirus-china-288816", "title": "Not the 'Chinese virus' or 'Wuhan virus', only coronavirus: China", "author": "Edited By:     ", "author_link": "", "published_date": "    New Delhi, India\n    ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "The World Health Organization recently warned against labelling viruses based on the place where it originated, for it could trigger racist rhetorics", "text": "As conspiracy theories surrounding coronavirus gain steam, China is countering them not only with theories of its own, but by simultaneously invalidating them. Many people across the internet claim that COVID-19 was manufactured by China to gain an economic edge over the world. Amid such claims, people have started referring to the virus as “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus”. The World Health Organization recently warned against labelling viruses based on the place where it originated, for it could trigger racist rhetorics.    On Wednesday, China lashed out and claimed that it has neither created nor intentionally transmitted the virus. Additionally, China has continuously requested global polity to avoid usage of “Chinese virus”. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy, Ji Rong, recently asserted that the world should solely focus on the response and tackling of the virus exhibited by China instead of “stereotyping the Chinese people”. Rong also pointed out the cooperative measures taken by India and China to prevent the virus from spreading across territories. According to Rong, India has provided medical supplies to China and has lent a helping hand. \"We express appreciation and thanks for that,\" Ji said. \"Those people who are trying to stigmatise China's efforts have ignored the huge sacrifices the Chinese people made in safeguarding the health and safety of all mankind\", he added. He additionally pointed out even though the first case was reported from within China, there’s no evidence linking the birth of the virus to the country.  \"China has neither created the virus nor intentionally transmitted it. The so-called \"Chinese virus\" is absolutely wrong,\" Ji said. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had faced flak recently for referring to pandemic as “Wuhan virus”. China referred to his words as “despicable behaviour” and an attempt to stigmatise the country. Instances of harassment of people with facial features akin to the Chinese have spurred in India and the US, with many facing attacks on the streets. \"The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the seasonal flu starting from September 2019 has so far sickened more than 30 million people and killed more than 20,000, and CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield admitted some were actually COVID-19 (cases),\" Ji said. \"At the early stage of the outbreak, China took a decisive decision to lock down Wuhan and cancel outbound tourist groups to prevent the spread of the epidemic,\" Ji added. According to him, China has shared the diagnostic and treatment aspects of the virus with the world from the beginning very openly. “Since January 3, China has been regularly notifying WHO and relevant countries and regions about the outbreak, and on January 12, it had already shared with WHO the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus”, he added. “China held an online video conference to brief 19 Eurasian and South Asian countries including India on China’s experience”, the spokesperson added. \"The Chinese enterprises have started to make donations to India. We stand ready to provide further support and assistance to the best of our capability in light of the needs of the Indian side. We believe that the Indian people will win the battle at an early date,\" he said.

Huang shot to fame in Taiwan in 2019 after she rolled her eyes at then-Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu as she questioned him during a meeting, earning herself the media nickname \"Goddess of the Eyeroll.\" Huang won plaudits from people concerned about Han's plans for a trade agreement with China for pinning Han down in a bid to figure out exactly what such an agreement would entail. Han, who was elected on a pro-China, pro-business platform for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), went on to lose his job in 2020 to a voter recall campaign, in which more than 97 percent of those who voted wanted him gone. The recall came after Han lost the January 2020 presidential election to Tsai by a margin of two-and-a-half million votes after Tsai campaigned to lessen Chinese influence and attempts to undermine the island's democracy, citing Beijing's treatment of Hong Kong as an example. But in February this year, Han's supporters launched an unsuccessful bid to recall Huang, based on her alleged violation of a draconian national security law imposed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Hong Kong. Huang wept public tears of joy at the time. But her view of the campaign is much more sobering, two months after the event. \"I think it's hard to know whether to laugh or cry, actually,\" Huang told RFA in a recent interview. \"We live in a free society, but they use its privileges to strike a blow for totalitarian rule.\" \"Now I think I can say with much greater certainty that I didn't do anything wrong,\" she said. \"The majority of people stood by me, so we should keep working to promote that philosophy.\" She said the jailing of most of Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp and the banning of speech linked to the 2019 protest movement had woken Taiwan's 23 million people up to the potential dangers of cooperation with China. \"Such huge changes have taken place, not very long after the [1997] handover of Hong Kong,\" Huang said. \"People in Taiwan are much more vigilant.\" \"It's so easy for freedom and democracy to just disappear one day, so we should increase our efforts to guard this last bastion of democracy,\" Huang said. Huang has never been to Hong Kong, and now that she has spoken out against the crackdown, she is unlikely to risk arrest by going there in future. But she is at peace with her decisions, and called on more people to be outspoken about China's human rights violations. \"If everyone is afraid, then nobody will be willing to speak out about such things,\" Huang said. Taiwan was ruled as a Japanese colony in the 50 years prior to the end of World War II, but was occupied by the 1911 Republic of China under the Kuomintang (KMT) as part of Tokyo's post-war reparation deal with the allies. It has never been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, nor formed part of the People's Republic of China, but Beijing insists it will reclaim the island, by force if necessary. Public opinion polls have shown that the violent suppression of Hong Kong's anti-government protest movement last year fueled fears for Taiwan's national security and democracy, and that only around 4.5 percent of Taiwan's 23 million people welcome the idea of Chinese rule. The island began a transition to democracy following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, starting with direct elections to the legislature in the early 1990s and culminating in the first direct election of a president, Lee Teng-hui, in 1996.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162653", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12285", "source": "scrapy"},

His lungs and spine are also in a bad state, and he is now mentally disturbed.” Nyima was formerly employed in a hydropower station in Draggo county and was one of many Tibetans detained for peacefully protesting against Chinese rule in Tibetan areas at the time of the Tibetan New Year in Draggo and Serta (Seda) counties, Jigme said. “Even though he was later sentenced to 10 years in prison by the Chinese government, he was released on Feb. 25 after completing only nine years of his sentence,” Jigme said, adding that police took Nyima directly to his home after completing the paperwork for his release, and that family members were warned by police not to come to the police station to receive him. Tibetan political prisoners suffering ill health are sometimes freed in critical condition before the end of their terms, with at least seven reported during the last year to have died—either in prison or following their release—from injuries inflicted under torture in custody, sources say. In a statement written by Nyima and obtained by RFA’s Tibetan Service, Nyima greeted his family following his release, adding, “I will never forget for as long as I live how the Chinese government put me behind bars and tortured me on false charges, and tore away all my human rights.” “Never forget what it means to be a Tibetan,” he said. “Don’t be discouraged, remain united, and always study your language and your religion. We all must be free from this repression.” Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans’ political activities and peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162653", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11870", "source": "scrapy"},

Tokyo's defence ministry said the \"ballistic missile-like objects\" did not cross into Japanese waters or the country's exclusive economic zone.   The latest launch by Pyongyang comes as a prolonged hiatus in disarmament talks with the United States drags on. A little over a week ago, the nuclear-armed North fired what were believed to be two short-range ballistic missile, describing them as a new \"tactical guided weapon\". A day later, North Korean state media announced that US President Donald Trump had sent a letter to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un detailing a plan to develop ties. The report cited Kim's powerful sister Kim Yo Jong, who warned that the apparently good personal relationship between the two leaders would not be enough to foster broader relations. \"In the letter, he... explained his plan to propel the relations between the two countries of the DPRK and the US and expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work,\" an apparent reference to the coronavirus pandemic, she said in the statement reported by the North's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). A senior US administration official confirmed Trump had sent a letter to Kim, \"consistent with his efforts to engage global leaders during the ongoing pandemic\".

He has reached Basaguda camp (of CRPF),” Bijapur district superintendent of police Kamal Lochan Kashyap said. He was scheduled to be flown to Raipur after his medical checkup, police said. “As soon as we learnt that the jawan was held hostage by Maoists, we contacted eminent people in the region, social activists and mediapersons to secure his release from Maoist custody,” Mr Kashyap said.   Earlier in the morning, the four-member interlocutor team headed by Padma Shri Dharam Pal Jain left for an undisclosed location in the forest on Sukma-Bijapur border to negotiate the release of the jawan with the Maoists. “I was contacted by the government to become an interlocutor to negotiate release of the jawan. I left for the appointed place in the morning along with other members of the team and some media persons to secure release of the jawan. I am happy that Naxals kept their promise to release the jawan if approached by government-appointed emissaries,” Mr Jain said. The other members of the emissary team were local tribal community leader Telam Boraiya, retired teacher Rudra Kere and sarpanch of Surkunda panchayat in Bijapur district, Rukmni Ekka.   With relief writ large on his face, the jawan after his release told reporters, “They (Naxals) treated me well when I was in their custody”.

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162654", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47703", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162654", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54751", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.dnaindia.com", "section": "entertainment", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report-world-health-day-2021-do-you-know-which-are-the-world-s-healthiest-countries-2021-to-live-in-check-the-full-list-here-spain-portugal-switzerland-japan-iceland-2885194", "title": "Do you know which are the world's healthiest countries to live in?

It also comes as an opportunity for those seeking to make a shift toward healthier living. Well, why not start today! As per World Health Organisation (WHO), this year's  World Health Day theme is 'Building a fairer, healthier world'.  Stating that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the countries hard, WHO mentioned that ours is an unequal world where \"some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income...little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services.\" WHO urged leaders around the world to \"monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.\" And while people across the globe are still struggling to come to terms with how much life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a U.K.-based price comparison website Money.co.uk has come out with a list of the world’s healthiest countries in 2021. The publications release this list every year and this time too it has been published on World Health Day.  The publication mentioned that their mortgage experts rank the healthiest countries and cities in the world on the basis of \"good food, good company and good transport links\". Additionally, conditions like air quality, pollution levels, cost of living, life expectancy among other things are taken into consideration.  Below is the list of the top 5 world's healthiest countries. According to the report, Spain is the healthiest country in the world. It mentioned a few reasons such as their Mediterranean lifestyle, walking as a mode of transport, which helps to lower deaths caused by pollution, cost of living is moderate among other things why the country topped their list.  l: As per the report, Portugal bagged the second spot on the list of the world's healthiest countries. Their high-ranking healthcare system is the reason why the country has achieved good rankings in several health indices over the years, including this one.  Switzerland is home to one of the happiest populations. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum's 2013 Human Capital Report, Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world.  Home to the oldest living population in the world, Japan obviously has one of the highest life expectancies in the world! Other factors that contribute to Japan being in the top five are: their smaller portion sizes and protein-dense diet, their notoriously fast transportation, walking as the preferred mode of transportation and high cost of living matched with the price among other things.   Good healthcare system, healthy diet and clean water among other things such as low levels of smoking, makes Iceland one of the world's healthiest countries to live in. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162654", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34613", "source": "scrapy"},

The three teens—identified by sources as Dadul, Sangye Tso, and Kansi, a nickname—were taken into custody after setting up their group during the Tibetan New Year, also called Losar, in mid-February, London-based Free Tibet said in a statement Wednesday. The group, called White Rocky Mountain Club, quickly gained 240 followers, alarming Chinese authorities who fear loss of control over political and social commentary by Tibetans over social media platforms, Free Tibet said. “These young people have been brutalized for exercising a right that most of us take for granted on a daily basis,” Free Tibet Campaigns and Advocacy Manager John Jones said in a statement. “I’d like to ask everyone to imagine if they had to invite a government official to [monitor] every one of their chat groups or face imprisonment and broken limbs.” Speaking to RFA, a Tibetan living in exile confirmed the arrests of the three. “Kansi, Sangye Tso, and Damdul [Dadul], who belonged to Domda township in Yushu prefecture’s Tridu [Chinese, Chenduo] county, were the presidents of this WeChat group,” RFA’s source said, citing contacts in the region. “All three of them were arrested in Domda and were detained in the Kyegudo detention center. Damdul has one younger sister,” RFA’s source said. Free Tibet said on March 3 that its research partner, Tibet Watch, later learned that the family of Dadul, whose legs were broken by police in a beating, were later told by Chinese authorities to bring 40,000 yuan (U.S. $6,000) with them to a hospital in Qinghai’s capital Xining to pay for Dadul’s treatment. Tibetan residents of Dadul’s Domda township have meanwhile raised funds for Dadul’s hospital stay that were given to his mother, sources told RFA. The present whereabouts of Sangye Tso and Kansi, who were taken with Dadul at first to the detention center in Kyegudo, are now unknown, sources said. Free Tibet regularly receives “stories of political prisoners dying in jail or shortly after release from long sentences for daring to speak up against their oppressors in any small way,” Jones said in his statement Wednesday. “We call on every government around the world to take concrete action to remind the [Chinese Communist Party] that, try as they might to hide their atrocities, we have not forgotten the Tibetan people.” Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following a failed March 10, 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans’ political activities and peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162654", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12147", "source": "scrapy"},

The reverse is also true. There are events or moments of life thinking about which can make one feel awful. It could be related to anything in the past like the unexpected loss of a loved one, changing dynamics of cherished relationships, emotionally taxing incidents or the struggles in the present moment that instantly makes one negative. Sometimes when a negative situation stays for too long, it can leave one overwhelmed in a way that the person seems to be addicted to negativity or develops a habit of ruminating. For instance, acting as a caregiver where hopes are not high, clinging to a toxic relationship or sticking with the wrong job because of one's helpless condition perceived or real. Rumination is continuously getting lost in a thought loop where you eventually end up thinking about that same negative or sad thought or experience. Why is it that we end up remembering what we want to forget? Perhaps negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that even when an individual has made a conscious thought to not pay heed to it, it keeps coming back. One of the reasons people ruminate is owing to the belief that by ruminating they will probably get an insight into their life or problem. However, it doesn't work out because in a state of ruminating the person is focused more on the problems and consequences instead of solutions. The person may perceive it as natural coping mechanism to adapt with the pain, but one has to ponder whether it's helping one solve a problem or just trapping back in an unhealthy thought cycle. Dwelling on negative thoughts and engaging in self-blame has been associated with mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Research by Peter Kinderman professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they had experienced many negative events in their lives. The question is how to intentionally forget things that only serve to disturb us. Can we exercise influence on our memory? Perhaps the easiest way to forget something is not revisiting it in your mind. There are many theories related to the process of motivated forgetting that suggest that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. According to Freud, memories that are likely to induce guilt, embarrassment, shame or anxiety are actively, but unconsciously, pushed out of consciousness as a form of ego defence. Unconscious or repressed memories are exceedingly difficult to retrieve but remain available. People may resort to 'repression' in which they subconsciously push unpleasant thoughts and feelings into their unconscious as an automatic defensive mechanism. Thought 'suppression' is also a  type of motivated forgetting when an individual consciously attempts to stop thinking about a particular thought. Memories are also forgotten through distortion as perGestalt theory of forgetting. This is also called false memory syndrome in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by false memories, recollections that are factually incorrect but yet are strongly believed. Rehearsing negative memories by ruminating over them only serve to strengthen them, so it's important to forget certain things to live life peacefully. Apparently, we may never forget things completely but when we stop thinking about them, it often fades away as we remember fewer facts. If rumination is affecting your personal growth stop and take notice of the circumstances and triggers that lead you to ruminate. Eliminating the trigger may not be possible always but by practicing mindfulness one can consciously try to respond with an element of awareness breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. This may require consistent practice and conscious efforts but it's important to check yourself lest negativity pulls you into a trap again. Finding a distraction like going for a walk, playing a game, calling a friend, watching a movie or getting engaged in any activity that breaks the chain can also be helpful. If constant rumination is disabling you and you are unable to focus your attention on other important things of life, seeking therapy can be beneficial. Otherwise meditating can also reduce rumination because it helps in de cluttering the mind to arrive at an emotionally calm state. Life is fleeting and made up of a collection of moments. Clinging on to negative experiences will only make us miss out on the beauty of 'now'.Next time if your answer to this question 'Do you remember what you want to forget?' carries away your mind to unpleasant memories and events, change the question itself. Ask yourself - 'Do you forget what you want to remember?' Answering it will not only break the thought cycle and distract your mind but transport you to all the beautiful memories and the blessings in the present moment, that perhaps money can't buy but fills the heart with gratitude.

She is a doctor, professor and a COVID-19 warrior. She is also leading the vaccination centre in Delhi’s Jamia Hamdard Hospital – making her the only transgender doctor in all of India to hold the role. Dr Shaikh is an inspiration to all – but her journey was anything but easy. Born a boy in a modest Mumbai family, Dr Shaikh knew she was ‘different’ when she was three-four years old. She was a third-year medical student when an endocrinologist first had a conversation about her identity and put a name to it. But this came as a shock to her family. On completing her undergraduate course, she moved from Mumbai to Delhi to undergo transition. She described that there was a point when everyone would stare at her, and even her mother was uncomfortable to go out for dinner with her. “Everyone would say, this person does not look like a male does not look like a female. Who are they? Why are they like this? And that was a struggle which lasted for one and a half years,” the professor recalled. When she was given the responsibility of leading the COVID-19 vaccination centre, Dr Shaikh knew that this would be a high pressure job. But her favourite part is to interact with people – especially senior citizens. “For them, there is a lot of anxiety involved – to go to a hospital and get the vaccine. And they really like if someone says a hello, or ask them how was their experience, if they found any difficulties, just some small talk and that can really brighten up their day,” she added. Dr Shaikh admitted that while she has been in a privileged position as a doctor, there are still some hush-hush talks, comments and giggles that make her uncomfortable. But she believes transgender visibility is the only way to break this.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://images.thequint.com/thequint%2F2020-09%2F681cffce-9147-414c-a78a-30e74e335ef3%2Fhero_image_2.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C2000%2C1125&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;fmt=webp&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Dr Beoncy’s Journey: Northeast’s First Transgender Doctor\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162438", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Court said, “this is hardly expected at the apex level as it creates a cascading effect down which does not speak well of the institution.” The Apex Court directed the Union of India and State Governments to respond on the following aspects: 1) Information regarding vacancy positions should be sent by all States to the National Commission within two weeks. This information should give the position as on 1st of March , 2021 and should also specify the vacancies which are going to arise in the next six months from that date. The updated information should be thereafter uploaded on the website of the National Commission. 2) In view of the new Act of 2019, some of the States have notified the amended Rules for recruitment while others have not. Insofar as the States who have not notified the Rules, they should indicate the time period within which the new Rules will come into force. 3) The States which have notified the Rules should inform as to within how much time will process for all the existing and prospective vacancies for a period of six months will be completed. This information should also be furnished by the States which have not framed the Rules by specifying the time period within which the rules will be framed (as aforesaid) and the time period within which thereafter their selection process will be completed. 4) The Central Government to inform whether any legislative impact study was completed before bringing in the new Act of 2019 and to place the said study before this Court. 5) The new Act expands the jurisdiction of the Consumer forums to many new areas and thus, logically a legislative impact study ought to have been completed keeping in mind the litigation which will shift in the subjects added to the jurisdiction of the Consumer Tribunals. 6) There is also a shifting of pecuniary jurisdiction by increasing the jurisdiction of the District and State Forum. This would result in transfer of a large number of cases to these two foras. Thus, the legislative impact study ought to have taken this into consideration as to what are cases which are likely to be shifted. 7) The two aforesaid aspects should have formed a part of the legislative impact study to see as to what are the quantum of cases the Tribunals at different levels will be faced with not only now but in the reasonable time frame for the future. 8) There should have been analysis both at the State level and the National level of the number of foras which are required to deal with the increase in the financial jurisdiction and the expanded legal area of jurisdiction. 9) We are also informed that in some of the State where rules have been notified there are problem of composition of the selection committee as the committee has to be chaired by the Chief Justice or his nominee. It is stated that at least in the States of Bihar and Uttarakhand the nomination by the Chief Justice is awaited. We are sure that in all States the respective Chief Justices will take care of the situation where a request has been so made. 10) There is also an issue of appropriate infrastructures. These are Consumer friendly institutions which have to deal with public. There should be not only sufficient number of presiding officers but support staff for the presiding officers which will include proper Court rooms, supporting staff, stenographers etc. and facilities for the incoming public and lawyers who attend to these proceedings. 11) We also call upon the States to file with their reports, the photographs of the existing infrastructure. 12) Learned Amicus have pointed out that they have annexed a questionaire dealing with both the vacancy position and infrastructure which would facilitate them to analyze the same. He submits that this questionaire can be a further tweaked in view of the orders passed today and the needful will be done and circulated to the State and the Union Government within a period of one week from today so that they respond accordingly as per the questionnaire. 13) We may notice that insofar as the   is concerned, learned ASG submits that endeavour has been in progress to fill up the six vacancies and the matter is with the ACC.  The Court has directed all the States to file their responses within three weeks of the questionaire being circulated along with their relevant affidavits. The Court would hear the matter next on 12.04.2021.  The Court had previously issued notice to all the Union Territories and the State Governments on a petition filed by the law student Saloni Gautam which had sought directions against the inaction of Governments in appointing President and members/staff of Districts and State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions across India. The Court in its order dated January 25, 2021, had noted that we have no doubt that the issue raised is important. But the petitioner, law student has filed a very sketchy petition. It does not show proper ground work being done.

Thousands of Tibetans died in the uprising and subsequent crackdown by China, and March 10 remains a politically sensitive date for Chinese authorities in Tibet, who routinely tighten surveillance and security measures in Tibetan areas of China to block protests ahead of the anniversary. In a day of activities to observe the anniversary around the world, Chinese authorities tightened security around Tibet, with government officials in the Tibet Autonomous Region's Lhoka city deploying security personnel in front of office buildings and driving military vehicles in processions along the city streets, a local source told RFA's Tibetan Service. Banners carried on the vehicles read, \"Those who violate the law will not escape punishment,\" spreading fear among local residents, RFA's source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Protest events and rallies were held on Monday in cities across Australia, Canada, the United States, Europe, Taiwan, and India, where activists from the Tibetan Youth Congress stormed the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi and were held briefly by police before being released. “For more than 60 years, millions of Tibetans have died and thousands of monasteries have been destroyed under China’s continuing repressive policies,” TYC general secretary Sonam Tsering said following the event. “So when the Tibetans inside Tibet have not lost faith in our struggle, we in exile must, and will, continue to keep the Tibetan issue alive,” Tsering said. Speaking at a ceremony held in Dharamsala, India—seat of Tibet’s exile government the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA)—CTA exile political leader, or Sikyong, Lobsang Sangay said Tibetans around the world had come together Monday to mourn the loss of “over a million Tibetans [who] have lost their lives in the past six decades under Chinese rule.” “But we are also here to mark the undaunted resilience of Tibetans in Tibet,” Sangay said. “Even under the threat of losing their lives, they continue to protest by protecting and preserving our language, our religion, our culture, our land, and our identity.” “As a college student, I am so happy to be taking part in commemorating the anniversary of our National Uprising Day,” Norzin Lhamo, a resident of Mysore in South India said, during a march to commemorate the event. “I just hope that we get our freedom, and am looking forward to the day when Tibetans inside Tibet and in exile can finally unite.” In the UK, Tibetan flag-raising ceremonies were held in Woolwich, Amherst, Northampton, and Easthampton, with another flag raising held in front of City Hall in Richmond, California, in the U.S., while in Europe peaceful protest rallies were held in Rome, Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, and Vienna. In Nepal, a country with close economic and political ties to China, authorities meanwhile barred Tibetans living in the country from marking the uprising’s anniversary, sending a notice on March 6 to the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office in Kathmandu appealing to Tibetan residents of Nepal to refrain from organizing protests or public gatherings. “March 10 is a sad day,” said Tibetan resident Choesang Dolma. “And though I can’t go out to observe this day here in Nepal, I am so proud of the other Tibetans around the world who will march in the streets to commemorate this important day,” Dolma said, adding that she would close her restaurant for the day to mark the event. U.S. lawmakers on Monday also voiced support for Tibet, with U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi saying, “Today, we continue to stand with the Tibetan people and honor those who sacrificed all for their rights and freedom.” “Tibetan men, women and children want simply to practice their faith, speak their language and celebrate their culture free from violence and intimidation. Yet, Beijing for decades has waged a campaign to destroy Tibet’s proud culture and history.” “[This] remains a clarion call for action to freedom-loving people worldwide,” Pelosi said. “I stand in solidarity with all the Tibetans around the world in commemorating the 62  anniversary of Tibetan Uprising Day,” added Massachusetts Congressman Jim McGovern, speaking in a video message in support. “Your actions today will send messages that we remember all who lost their lives and who are driven from their homes in Tibet,” McGovern said, at the same time urging the administration of U.S. President Biden to “effectively implement” legislation supporting Tibet signed into law by former president Trump. The U.S. State Department in a statement meanwhile called on China to “respect the human rights of Tibetans and the preservation of Tibet’s environment as well as the unique cultural, linguistic, and religious identity of Tibetan traditions.” Also on Monday, the Germany-based World Uyghur Congress—representing ethnic Uyghurs in exile and at home in northwestern China’s Xinjiang where more than a million members of the mostly Muslim minority group have been held in political reeducation camps—voiced support for Tibetans’ struggle for freedom. “Uyghurs and Tibetans share a similar history and struggle,” the WUC said in a statement. “Both people saw their land and fundamental freedoms being stripped away from them.” “Today, Tibetans and Uyghurs are living under the repressive genocidal regime of the [Chinese Communist Party], and the diaspora community lives in exile, advocating for democracy and fundamental freedoms,” the WUC said. Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed March 10 uprising. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans’ political activities and peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings. The Tibetan diaspora is estimated to include about 150,000 people living in 40 countries, mainly India, Nepal, North America, and in Europe. About 7 million Tibetans live in Tibet and adjacent provinces of China.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"Tibetan Uprising Day event held in Taipei_ByRFA Mandarin Paul Lee_02.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/uprising-03102021175128.html/tibetan-uprising-day-event-held-in-taipei_byrfa-mandarin-paul-lee_02.jpg/@@images/c564043b-67c6-4c9a-8af9-c16389d1dc53.jpeg\" title=\"Tibetan Uprising Day event held in Taipei_ByRFA Mandarin Paul Lee_02.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162656", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13752", "source": "scrapy"},

Of these, 20 who had successfully completed all modules were selected to move on to Stage 3, based on the results of an online test and the votes received for their recipes. They were required to make a business pitch to a jury comprising top people from the food and hospitality industry. The best 10 contestants were given financial support of `5 Lakh to launch their business with brand development support from Maggi India. Shreya was a winner under the ‘Food Delivery Business’ category.   \r\nShreya says, “I was browsing through Instagram when I saw the advertisement about the competition in January, I immediately signed up with my recipe and food business model. After three weeks I got a call saying I was on the shortlist of 250.  For Stage 2, I had to create a recipe using their product and made it to the top 20  with my ‘Mexican Theplas’.

It would have acted as the counterweight to the Saudi-born fundamentalist Wahhabism. And it would have been, largely, an Indian contribution. This is the thesis of Ghazala Wahab’s timely book that is simultaneously a ready-reckoner for Islam as well as an appeal to moderate Muslims to reclaim their faith. Wahab’s urgent intervention pertains to the current moral crisis afflicting Muslims who number over 1.9 billion and form about 25 per cent of the globe. Written in crisp prose filtered through a lens of empathy and humour, her quest to examine Islam draws equally on scripture, memoir and reportage. She interviews the who’s who of Muslim India from politicians and bureaucrats to seminary heads and theologians. But she also has her ear to the ground, and is careful to catch every dilemma and strand of opinion of the common man and woman, be they a humble tradesman, the “new Muslim” or the successful professional, a dadi at Shaheen Bagh or a young student at the madrassa.   So far, the discourse on the Islamic question has been chiefly contained in the West, conducted as it has been by the likes of Susan Okin (“Feminism and Multiculturalism: Some Tensions”), Ayaan Hirsi Ali (maker of  , belonging to the alt-right camp), Irshad Manji (founder of the Muslim refusenik movement), Ameena Wadud and “ex-Muslim” Sarah Haider. Barring Hasan Suroor’s important 2019 work, however, this is the first book coming out of India capturing this discourse as it plays out in this country. The last fact makes it all the more accessible to the lay reader.   The reader, for instance, may be aware that much of the problems of the moderate Indian Muslim stems from their religious obligation to follow the Muslim orthodoxy, the ulema. But did they know that, as a phenomenon, the overarching influence of the mullahs is fairly recent? It began only after the collapse of the Mughal empire, before which the influence of the Sufis who were championed by the emperor was more widespread. The predominant view about Sufism is that it exists outside Islam as a cult born out of the admixture of Hinduism with the Prophet’s faith. But this is self-serving propaganda spread by two sources, the prejudiced West which failed to reconcile the sophistication of Sufi writings with what, in its view, was a “desert religion”, and the Islamic orthodoxy itself. The origin of Sufism much predated its presence in India. Hazrat Rabia of Basra died in AD 801.     Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (AD 1058-1111) was the first scholar to lend theological heft to Sufi mysticism, marrying it with Sharia. While Golden Age (Abbasid) philosophers like Averroes and Avicenna were among the first Muslim rationalists, it was Ghazali who arguably laid the foundation of Islamic heterodoxy. He said that as long as one believed in Allah and Muhammad, Islam could be practised in different ways. Nevertheless, this ruled out the philosophy of atheism. Neither of the Abrahamic religions is known to accommodate it. Until a generation ago, there were two kinds of Muslims in India, the Communists and the conformists, Wahab says. The conformists were the regular moderate Muslims. If sceptic, they were careful to hide their worldview from the ulema. For them, the personal was not political. The Communists, on the other hand, identified as agnostic. They were, at best, cultural Muslims. While they had been drawn to this ideology because it resonated with the Islamic ideals of equality and justice, since they did not identify as true-blue Musalman, within their community, their voices went unheard. Nor did they themselves find it important to address the dogma and bigotry from within by, say, reforming the clergy. Thus Wahab illustrates the failure of Left politics to address the fundamental reality of identity as well as the Islamic problem.   Now, if Wahab is critical of Hindutva and Saudi preponderance on the clergy, she is equally irked by the Congress governments’ minority politics. Citing Wajahat Habibullah’s 2016 article, she mentions M.J. Akbar’s role in the passage of the Rajiv Gandhi government’s infamous 1986 Muslim women’s bill. It was Akbar who had prevailed on Rajiv Gandhi to contest the Shah Bano judgment, saying that if he did not, it would appear that the Prime Minister did not regard the Muslim community as his own. Akbar was subsequently seen expanding this point in a Doordarshan debate against Arif Mohammad Khan.   The Hadith is contextual, writes the author, as is the Quran. The custodians of the faith need to move with the times in order to prevent the religion from atrophying. But what if one differs from the holy book in one’s analysis of context? Is it not bowing to stereotype to regard the status of women as subhuman in tribal Arabia before the arrival of the Prophet? If so, what of the example of Khadija, the Prophet’s first wife? Should have the Prophet’s wives and honest, thereby more capable, women, rather than the already less powerful slave women, been robbed of their agency to operate in the cause of good via physical encumbrance only so as to distinguish one group from the other? Is covering up also either a moral or an ultimately effective way to combat sexist aggression? There are no easy answers. These are some areas that the book does not go into.   Elsewhere, the author does write that the opportunity for freethinking is limited when exercised from within the Islamic faith. Liberal Islam may indeed be an oxymoron, by that token. All the same, it is interesting to note how key definitions from other faiths sit perfectly inside it. The author’s own liberal rationalism is the Buddhist way of the instinct- and deed-driven mahayana, while the orthodoxy’s essentialism would be the intellect-driven hinayana way. Quite startlingly, the Hindu dichotomy of   (dual and singular manifestations of God) also exists within Islam because the Naqshbandiyah order of Sufism rejects the Chishti and other silsila on the ground that the identification of the self with Allah is subjective and does not produce any objective manifestation, hence leading to idolatry.   The author’s caveat is that the moderate Muslim even today has no voice or traction within the larger Muslim society. They are caught between the Hindu right wing that regards them as exceptional and thus invisibilises them and the Muslim right wing which disparages them for their apologism. She exhorts these people to give up their conformism and take responsibility for their beliefs. Simultaneously, she notes a rise of Muslim exceptionalism and reverse identity politics among community members in reaction to Hindutva, as evidenced in the   sloganeering during the 2019 CAA protests.   “Young working professionals are overnight discovering headscarves. The more one points to the headscarf as a symbol of Islamic patriarchy or women’s oppression, the more professional women turn up in one to register their protest.” (p. 367) Such an assertion of identity leads to the closedness of the mind in a way that runs contrary to freedom and modernism, she surmises. Clearly, a gap exists between expressions of Muslim identity and its spirit of fearless large-heartedness. It is this gap that the book strives to fill. And in so doing it perhaps becomes the vehicle through which the writer bears her own shahadah to her Muslim heritage.   By Ghazala Wahab Aleph, Rs 999", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/1c2e1c94a6acfdf3c4868602b120840eaf249bef-tc-img-columnists.jpg\" class=\"mugShotHome\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162659", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "21670", "source": "scrapy"},

Their stupendous performance in last year’s IPL earned them a ticket to Team India. Their inclusion has once accentuated the significance of playing well in the IPL. But unfortunately, the competition was so intense that neither of them could find a place in the playing X1 in the ODI team. Krunal Pandya replaced Suryakumar Yadav for the ODIs; in fact, the latter made his ODI debut against England last Tuesday and scored a record 26-ball 50. \r\nSimilarly, despite some good performances, K.L. Rahul is facing stiff competition from Rishab Pant as a wicket-keeping batsman.   And with the next edition of IPL set to happen next month, more new faces are likely to emerge, putting existing performers in trouble. Ishan and Suryakumar were among the 12 batsmen who scored 350-plus runs in last year’s IPL. Naturally, they were drafted into the National side for the recent T-20 series against England. Cricket administrator and former Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) for Kolkata Knight Riders Makarand Waingankar agrees that IPL has helped many cricketers to play for Team India. He adds that the format has given the players a great opportunity to play against international cricketers much before they make their international debut.   “Youngsters have become fearless because of their IPL stints. The situation is so dynamic that it has become challenging for players to retain their spots in the team,” points out Makarand, and adds that sometimes even top performers have to be dropped because of the competition. “Team India won matches in Australia even without Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, etc. But now if they come back, where do you slot them?” he asks. While former greats like Sachin Tendulkar, M.S. Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, etc., had the luxury of playing the game almost till their 40s, the situation for the current crop looks grim. At a time where even performers are being left out due to high competition, cricketers’ longevity on the field is in jeopardy.   Sports analyst and historian Sunil Yashkalra describes the current situation as a ‘problem of plenty’. Commenting that league tournaments are the germination points of talent, he feels having a long stint like Dhoni, Sachin and Yuvraj could be difficult these days. “Today, longevity depends on not just skill but on temperament and fitness,” shares Sunil. He feels intense fitness will be the key differentiator for longevity in the game. “Vihari has done so well, but just one injury, and he is out of the team. And with the IPL taking place next month, the competition is even more intense, it makes things even tougher. Hence it is significant that a player stays injury-free,” he stresses.   Former Indian cricketer and former coach of the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, Lalchand Rajput, reminisces that during his tenure, fitness was never a parameter. During the ’80s there wasn’t much emphasis on fitness, but only skill, he explains, adding that today, a player first needs to be an athlete to make the cut. Observers feel that while Team India may not soon see the likes of Sachin, Sehwag and Dhoni who played for several years, the BCCI should follow a strict rotation policy, where a mandatory rest is given to players after taking part in a certain number of matches.   Former cricketer and Chief selector M.S.K. Prasad says that before he took charge, there were only 20 players playing all three formats (Test, ODI and T-20). He had visualized developing sustainable bench strength over a period of time to nurture the team to where it is now. “Bench strength (competition) will certainly challenge senior players’ longevity. With youngsters chipping in, it will also push seniors to perform better, so eventually, it will help Team India,” explains Prasad, who points out that Indian won the test series against Australia despite not having its seven main players.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162659", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17213", "source": "scrapy"},

Authorities in March announced the establishment of 697 committees staffed by 1,960 inspectors, state media sources said, adding that the groups have tightened surveillance especially in and near villages on the border, demanding that travel documents be shown by Tibetans traveling in those areas. Large numbers of blue-uniformed security troops have now been deployed in Tibet’s Lhodrag (Chinese, Luozha) and Nyalam (Nielamu) counties, a Tibetan resident of the regional capital Lhasa told RFA’s Tibetan Service this week. “And any Tibetans traveling there from outside these regions have to show a document stamped with a travel permit,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “There has been a surge in crackdowns by Chinese authorities on villages in Tibet in recent years, though this used to happen more in the cities and towns before,” he said. “Following [Chinese President] Xi Jinping’s declaration that in administering the border regions, “'We must first of all stabilize Tibet,'” we have seen an intensified crackdown on Tibetans living inside Tibet,” a second source said, also declining to be named for reasons of security. Chinese authorities recently carried out a wave of arrests in Lhasa and along Tibet’s border with Nepal in the run-up to a month of politically sensitive anniversaries beginning in March, including the March 10 anniversary of a failed 1959 Tibetan national uprising against Chinese rule, sources said in earlier reports. Among those taken into custody were Tibetans suspected of sharing information on the deaths of Chinese soldiers killed in a border clash with India last June in the Galwan Valley of Ladakh, one source in Lhasa told RFA on March 1. Chinese authorities in Tibet maintain tight controls over information flows in the region, arresting Tibetans for sharing news and opinions on social media and for contacting relatives living in exile, sometimes with news of anti-China protests, according to rights groups and other experts. “Since Xi Jinping assumed power, the crackdown and policies aimed at destroying Tibetan culture and identity have intensified more than ever,” Tsering Tsomo, director of the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, told RFA. “We usually consider human rights to be an issue of an individual’s own rights and freedoms, but in the case of Tibet, this has come to involve the survival of the Tibetan people themselves,” Tsomo said, adding, “This is about protecting the human rights of an entire race.” A report released Wednesday by the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) says heavy surveillance and control risk turning the Tibetan Buddhist monastic community into “a tool of the Chinese Communist Party.” The report, “Party Above Buddhism: China’s Surveillance and Control of Tibetan Monasteries and Nunneries,” details a campaign of “direct oversight of monasteries and nunneries; stationing police and party cadres inside religious institutions; and pressuring monks and nuns to denounce the Dalai Lama.” The report notes that the United Front Work Department, the agency that has direct oversight of all religions, saw its budget for the Tibet Autonomous Region shoot up from from 23.9 million yuan in 2016 to 62 million yuan last year, and cites state media figures showing that in 2015 as many as 6,575 cadres from the party and government work in the 1,787 monasteries in the TAR. “Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism requires Tibetan Buddhist institutions, canon and the clergy to be subservient to the Communist Party’s leadership and its core values.

Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a military crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup.   The junta's violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar's myriad ethnic armed groups. The US State Department said it was ordering the departure of \"non-emergency US government employees and their family members\". The decision was taken to protect the safety and security of staff and their families, the State Department said. World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta cadres with sanctions. But the pressure has not swayed the generals. Saturday, the annual Armed Forces Day, saw the biggest loss of life so far, with at least 107 people killed.   The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar's 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions. Three of them -- the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army (AA) -- on Tuesday threatened to join protesters' fight unless the military reined in its crackdown. While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days.   A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible. The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes. Further strikes were launched on Tuesday, but Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU's head of foreign affairs, said the group would continue its position of \"strongly supporting people's movement against (the) military coup\". The KNU's Fifth Brigade put out a statement on Tuesday condemning the air strikes and warning it had no option but to \"confront these serious threats\" posed by the military.   Around 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes. The Thai foreign ministry said late Tuesday about 2,300 have returned to Myanmar, while about 550 remain in Thailand. Karen activists have accused the Thai authorities of pushing people back and accused them of blocking UN refugee officials from the area. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha insisted that there was \"no influx\" of refugees and that the kingdom's authorities had not \"scared them off with guns or sticks\".   Some Karen people injured in the weekend strikes sought medical treatment Tuesday on the Thai side of the border -- the most serious case was a 15-year-old with a collapsed lung and broken rib. Thai police said they had intercepted 10 parcels containing 112 grenades and 6,000 rounds of ammunition in northern Chiang Rai province that had been destined for Myanmar's notorious border town Tachileik. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Myanmar on Wednesday, requested by former colonial power Britain. The 15 members will meet behind closed doors, beginning with a briefing from the UN's special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162659", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18095", "source": "scrapy"},

Speaking to RFA, Khan urged everyone listening to her interview to lobby the Tower Hamlets Council to agree to the motion. A request to fly the banned Tibetan national flag at Borough offices on March 10, the anniversary of a failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, had earlier been turned down by the borough’s mayor, but Khan and fellow Borough Councilor Peter Gold then held up the Tibetan flag outside Borough offices themselves. \"I'm just very humbled that I can stand up for the people of Tibet, the Uyghur Muslims, and the people of Hong Kong, and all those who have been oppressed by the Chinese government. Not by the people of China, but by the Chinese Communist Party,\" Khan told RFA. “Tower Hamlets Borough is a significant political location, as the Chinese Embassy has been proposed to relocate there,” said Thinley Dhondup, Secretary of the Tibetan Community UK. “And ever since we Tibetans learned that Rabina Khan has proposed [the renaming of the streets], we Tibetans have felt it was important to urge the mayor to raise the Tibetan flag on Tibetan Uprising Day,” he said. Tower Hamlets Mayor John Biggs said that Khan's plans would have to go through the normal review process, but that the borough backed such expressions of solidarity with oppressed people. ‘’While we may welcome the Chinese embassy to our borough in the future, we will of course not refrain from expressing the views of the Council, on behalf of our community, or asserting our support for the freedom and diversity of our borough,\" he told RFA. \"We are home to a large number of Muslim residents and there is no doubt that the reported treatment of the Uyghurs represents everything our community is against. Tower Hamlets has a proud tradition of fighting racism and will always will be No Place for Hate.’’ Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and Tibet’s spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers later fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. In northwestern China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China has meanwhile interned over a million Uyghur Muslims accused of “religious extremism” in political reeducation camps, while in Hong Kong, a national security law imposed last year by Beijing has removed the Chinese Communist Party’s political opposition and stifled the freedoms promised under the terms of the city’s return to China by its former colonial ruler Britain.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"london-poster.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/embassy-03162021160246.html/london-poster.jpg/@@images/c9fb72c1-2a47-48f2-af7f-86b174e10a56.jpeg\" title=\"london-poster.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162659", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11811", "source": "scrapy"},

Amidst a national lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery.   On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American's lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US. Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31. He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.   The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country. No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday mid-night, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House will not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday.   Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban. I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today, Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden. The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work  and millions more desperate to make ends meet  now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources, he wrote.   In his letter, Hawley wrote that the unemployment rate remains at 6.2 per cent  with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis  and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions, he said. In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers.   I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programmes to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm, Hawley added.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162659", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17476", "source": "scrapy"},

Speaking on March 11 at a meeting of the Chinese People’s Consultative Conference, Panchen Gyaltsen (Chinese, Gyaincain) Norbu, a member of the CPCC Standing Committee, said that “Foreign anti-China forces have been hyping Tibet issues and religious issues in China, and transforming the topics into political bargaining chips.” “As long as a person has sanity and an objective stance, he would see the truth very clearly,’ Norbu said in remarks quoted by China’s official  , which noted that the U.S. State Department in a statement the day before had said that China “shouldn’t interfere with the succession process of [exiled Tibetan spiritual leader] the Dalai Lama.” The comments by the Panchen Gyaltsen Norbu, who is widely regarded by Tibetans as a puppet of Beijing, drew a sharp rebuke this week from Tenzin Tsetan, an analyst at the Dharamsala, India-based Tibet Policy Institute. “The Tibet Policy and Support Act signed into law by the U.S. government imposes sanctions on Chinese Communist Party officials if they interfere with the reincarnation process of Tibetan religious leaders,” Tsetan said, referring to legislation passed in the U.S. Congress in December and signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump. “I think the Chinese government is manipulating [this issue] by using their own appointed Panchen Lama to assert their [own] claims,” Tsetan added. The Tibet Policy and Support Act 2020 establishes as U.S. policy that the selection of Tibetan religious leaders, including future successors to exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, is a decision to be made only by Tibetans, free from Chinese government interference. Concerns over the advancing age of the Dalai Lama, now 85, have renewed uncertainties in recent years over his possible successor after he dies, with Beijing claiming the right to name his successor and the Dalai Lama himself saying that any future Dalai Lama will be born outside of China. In supporting China’s policies, Gyaltsen Norbu may be speaking under coercion, though, says London-based Tibet expert Robbie Barnett, formerly director of the Modern Tibetan Studies program at Columbia University. “We can’t really judge anyone, especially not a Tibetan in China, by what they say publicly. Chinese officials have always praised the Communist Party, and it’s difficult to know whether those words of appreciation are genuine or not,” Barnett said. “It may also be that these officials are being coerced into praising the Communist Party,” he said. “Since Chinese President Xi Jinping assumed power [in 2013], the crackdown and policies aimed at destroying Tibetan religion, culture, and identity have intensified more than ever,” said Karma Choeying—spokesperson for the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan government in exile, the Central Tibetan Administration. “Tibetans inside Tibet have and will continue to resist China’s widespread brutality, and Tibetans in exile must always remain vigilant and be aware of the [Chinese Communist Party’s] intentions,” Choeying said. Tibetans remain bitter about Chinese intervention in the selection 25 years ago of the current 11  Panchen Lama, whose predecessor died in 1989. The recognition in 1995 by exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama of six-year-old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the Panchen Lama angered Chinese authorities, who three days later took the boy and his family into custody and then installed Gyaltsen Norbu as their own candidate in his place. The Panchen Lama installed by Beijing remains unpopular with Tibetans both in exile and at home.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162659", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12325", "source": "scrapy"},

Only three new cases have been registered across China with no fresh fatalities. China’s National Health Commission claims that Wuhan now has zero new patients. “Thanks to the joint efforts of Wuhan and medical staff from around the country,” said Mi Feng, a spokesman for the commission. Out of the three new reported cases in the country on Sunday, two were imported infections, ie, they were transmitted or originated from outside China. The third was a case transmitted in the northeastern border town of Heilongjiang, which has recently witnessed a surge in cases in cases as people from Russia make their way back into the country. After months of lockdown in China, the country is reopening slowly. So far, over 82,000 cases have been recorded in the country, and over 4,633 people have died. However, authorities are fearful of a second wave. On Sunday, Beijing announced a slew of measures to promote “civilised behaviour”. As part of this, citizens have been advised not to sneeze and cough in public. Additionally, they have been asked not to eat in public and also to don a mask during sickness. Further, restaurants across the country have been instructed to provide utensils and to stop serving family style meals in favour of individual portions. All these provisions are expected to come into force starting June 1. In the last few weeks, China has faced mounting pressure and criticism globally for withholding information about the virus and for fudging numbers. Recently, the authorities increased the death toll of Wuhan by 50 per cent out of the blue. Given the nature of the virus, which sometimes manifests itself without any symptoms has raised fears of reinfection, as it spreads at a much faster rate than SARS but has a lower fatality rate than it. Those who have recovered and underwent 14 days of isolation are now required to be put under observation for an extra seven days, whereby they shall be barred from venturing outside. The city of Shenzhen now has 461 infections, and anybody entering the city through its ports is forced to undergo quarantine. Over the last month, everyone entering the city was put in 14 days of isolation. In the midst of this all, China is facing questions from the global community, who are wondering whether China could have averted a global crisis by reporting it early. Recently, many countries including Australia called for independent query into the virus’ origins. China threatened with consumer retaliation. US President Donald Trump has also repeatedly asserted plans to hold China accountable if any link is found between the authorities and the origin of the virus, and in case of any negligence shown. Recently, Trump administration stopped its funding of the World Health Organization (WHO) for its late response to the virus.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/04/27/138278-untitled-design-9.jpg?itok=FPDOL1EC\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162657", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22280", "source": "scrapy"},

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162704", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45260", "source": "scrapy"},

By stating he would no longer be head of the fourth-generation (4G) team of leaders in Government, Mr Heng has thrown the question of who will succeed PM Lee wide open yet again. Mr Heng, a career civil servant until he contested in the 2011 General Election (GE), had been chosen as the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) First Assistant Secretary-General in November 2018. In April 2019, he was appointed Singapore’s sole DPM, signifying that there had been a consensus among the 4G team that Mr Heng should lead them and the country. With these developments, Mr Heng, was in all senses, the PM-designate. He was even handed the task of Acting PM in the absence of PM Lee. When he brought his East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) to a slim victory after an 11th hour switch from his stronghold in Tampines GRC in GE2020, some were generous to say that he successfully held off a rout by the Workers’ Party. A second camp argued he had been wounded by his performance and wondered if the party might review his suitability as the nation’s next leader. They might think their instinct was right when Mr Heng said he was stepping aside for a new leader but he has also debunked this perceived link: “The results in the GE2020 performance, in particular, in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside,” he said at the media conference on Thursday. In response to DPM Heng’s announcement, the 4G leaders said in a statement on Thursday “this unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning”. Given that PM Lee also said he would be announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks’ time, the question arises: Why was it not possible to pair the announcements to give the assurance to citizens that there would be, nonetheless, forward momentum in the process of leadership renewal? Since PM Lee said there would be consequential shifts, would those whose political stocks rise – a second DPM, a new Minister for Finance or even a new Defence Minister, for instance, give indication of who the PAP might test as a replacement for Mr Heng. But whose choice would that be? While the two-week interregnum may cause the rumour mills to go into overdrive, can the matter of who the 4G leaders wish to select be settled quite so quickly? Should it? Having said that, if current Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is also Second Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP, were to be placed in the powerful Finance Minister role, it could be taken as a forgone conclusion that Mr Chan is next in line to succeed PM Lee. This would be the fastest way to resolve the succession question. Like Mr Heng, Mr Chan entered Government with the 2011 GE. He has held a few full ministerial portfolios but most unusually, has had a tour of duty outside of mainstream government as the country’s labour chief - Secretary-General at the National Trades Union Congress. He has also been developing his international exposure through a collaborative project between the Government and that of Chongqing province in the People’s Republic of China. His previous incarnation as a Major-General and Chief of Army in the Singapore Armed Forces will have afforded him defence networks in the region and also in the United States where he was the first foreign graduate to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award by the prestigious Army Command and General Staff College. In his current portfolio as Industry and Trade Minister during the pandemic, Minister Chan has worked overtime to secure multilateral trade arrangements and ensure that international trade lines remain open. However, at Thursday’s press conference on Mr Heng’s announcement, Mr Chan and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung - another 4G member touted to be a contender for the premiership - said that the 4G team will need time to consider afresh and “holistically” who might be most suited to be the “captain of the team” using Ong’s preferred metaphor.  In other words, the most obvious choice may not be the answer. What is at stake here? The deleterious public health and economic effects of COVID-19, Mr Heng, explained, would require several years to recede.  PM Lee has also previously acknowledged this while assuring Singaporeans that he will see Singapore through the current crisis and is “determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team”. If he only took over as premier then, Mr Heng would already be in his mid-60s. Sixty-five, we know, is the age when Singapore’s first PM Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to stand down and also two years older than when its second PM, Goh Chok Tong, transferred premiership to the current PM.  This would not have given Mr Heng a long enough runway to govern before the handover to the next leader is expected. This cycle of leadership succession would have started again all too soon. Precious time has been lost to the pandemic since the PM-in-waiting was also limited in his ability to travel overseas to strengthen his standing in the international community. From the disruptions that emanate from US-China relations and the domestic political instability within some of our Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncertainty about how ASEAN can continue to provide ballast for peace, stability and security in the region, which Singapore relies on, is something PM Lee’s successor must be prepared to address.  This person must have a certain level of exposure and experience in operating on that plane. In that regard, the two former Principal Private Secretaries to the current PM, Mr Ong and Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who are on the other hand 51 and 48 years old respectively, may also have some help to draw upon.  They can ride on the networks they have built from that role as well as the tutelage of the current PM - much like Mr Heng could, given that he played the same role to Singapore’s first PM. The advantage might go to Mr Wong, who has built a high and favourable public profile as co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 and clearly has the confidence of DPM Heng, serving as the latter’s Second Minister of Finance since August 2016. If on the other hand, the 4G privileges a leader’s standing domestically and more importantly, his or her ability to motivate to inspire peers and citizens, the people-oriented Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at 44 years of age may be given more time to prove himself. Ironically, this process of readying these individuals and testing the dynamics among the 4G leaders without Mr Heng in the picture will indeed take time. The next PAP Conference and GE may even be needed as barometers of support among cadres and citizens. With PM Lee to provide the firm and steady leadership through the severe and immediate COVID-19 challenge, the best way forward is to take a step back to watch how these candidates continue to interact with Singaporeans, their international counterparts and each other before a new successor is announced.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/10586236/bf96a54634b0637b0f830fbf41a3019f/gillian-koh-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Koh\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162704", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48791", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.amarujala.com", "section": "\n", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.amarujala.com/photo-gallery/entertainment/television/ex-bigg-boss-contestant-digangana-suryavanshi-attacked-by-peacock-video-goes-viral?src=top-lead", "title": null, "author": "\n", "author_link": "", "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162637", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The prime minister after consultations on Friday instructed the Ministry of Commerce and his economic team to immediately take steps to facilitate the relevant sectors, value added, apparel and sugar, by finding alternative cheap sources of import of the needed commodities, the Dawn newspaper quoted sources as saying.   Various proposals have been presented to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) which considers these suggestions from an economic and commercial point of view. After consideration by the ECC, its decisions are presented to the Cabinet for ratification and final approval, the report said. In the present case, a proposal was presented to the ECC to allow the import of cotton, cotton yarn and sugar from India keeping in view domestic requirements, it said. With regards to the ECC decision to allow import of sugar, cotton and cotton yarn from India, Khan held consultations with key members of his Cabinet on Friday and decided that Pakistan could not go ahead with any trade with India under the current circumstances, it said.   The ECC had decided on commercial grounds to recommend these imports for the Cabinet's consideration. While the decision was not on the formal agenda of the Cabinet meeting, the issue was brought up by Cabinet members and the prime minister instructed that the ECC's decision be deferred and immediately reviewed, the report said. The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Khan on Thursday rejected the proposal of the high-powered committee to import cotton from India, with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserting that there can be no normalisation of ties until New Delhi reverses its decision in 2019 to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.   Pakistan's U-turn on Thursday came a day after the ECC, under newly-appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, recommended importing cotton and sugar from India, lifting a nearly two-year-long ban on its import from the neighbouring country amidst tensions over the Kashmir issue. India has said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility, and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility. India has also told Pakistan that talks and terror cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.   The ECC's decision had raised hopes of a partial revival of Pakistan-India bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on the import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. India's move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162704", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17428", "source": "scrapy"},

For Hyderabad-based Sabista Khan, the name is synonymous with both dreams coming true and shoes. Her label ‘The Cinderella Story’ offers a wide variety of jutties not just to go with ethnic Indian clothes, but also quirky ones that go well with western outfits. Many Bollywood actresses, especially Kriti Sanon, Soha Ali Khan, Diana Penty, Manisha Koirala and Rhea Kapoor are quite often been seen sporting the brand. \r\nTalking about her initial days and how she entered the shoe business, Sabista says, “I had moved to Hyderabad from Mumbai in 2015 and was initially interested in designing clothes. But after doing some research I found that there are lots of fashion designers in Hyderabad. I next thought of bringing out belts and bags, before settling for shoes.” \r\nSabista says initially, they were curating and reselling footwear from across the country, bringing them under one label for various pop up exhibitions. “Soon we got a lot of requests for jutties. But we wanted to design our jutties instead of curating them. Reselling didn’t satisfy my creative urge; so then I started researching and travelling to learn about jutties,” she shares.   \r\nSabista was working in corporate communications and as a content writer till 2018, before diving into her business. “I ordered and studied about jutties to understand the issues. Fit was an issue, as some people have broad feet and jutties have a closed front. I wanted everyone to be comfortable wearing our jutties. Comfort first then style. So we treated the leather to not bite,” she explains. From February to April 2019, Sabista did a mock run and went live in April. “Lot of stylists took note of our work and included our footwear in celebrity styling and photo shoots. “Sobhita Dhulipala was the first celebrity to use one of my creations. It was for a teaser shoot of the Made in Heaven web series. I saw the teaser on my television, noticed the footwear and was completely ecstatic. The stylist had not shown me the shoot photos earlier. It was an amazing feeling,” reminiscences Sabista.   \r\nAll said and done, the two-year journey has been a roller coaster ride for Sabista.  The pandemic made 2020 a low period. “We were taking it slow post lockdown too, but social media helped us a lot in promoting our work,” she says. “There was immense personal growth; people took note of our work. It has been an amazing journey,” she adds. Sabista highlights the fact that technology helped her sail through the crisis. Sabista is now diversifying into sliders and mules, perfect for day-to-night look transitions. “The latest collection will have 13 pieces and will go live in May,” she announces.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162704", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16168", "source": "scrapy"},

It also comes as an opportunity for those seeking to make a shift toward healthier living. Well, why not start today! As per World Health Organisation (WHO), this year's  World Health Day theme is 'Building a fairer, healthier world'.  Stating that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the countries hard, WHO mentioned that ours is an unequal world where \"some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income...little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services.\" WHO urged leaders around the world to \"monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.\" And while people across the globe are still struggling to come to terms with how much life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a U.K.-based price comparison website Money.co.uk has come out with a list of the world’s healthiest countries in 2021. The publications release this list every year and this time too it has been published on World Health Day.  The publication mentioned that their mortgage experts rank the healthiest countries and cities in the world on the basis of \"good food, good company and good transport links\". Additionally, conditions like air quality, pollution levels, cost of living, life expectancy among other things are taken into consideration.  Below is the list of the top 5 world's healthiest countries. According to the report, Spain is the healthiest country in the world. It mentioned a few reasons such as their Mediterranean lifestyle, walking as a mode of transport, which helps to lower deaths caused by pollution, cost of living is moderate among other things why the country topped their list.  l: As per the report, Portugal bagged the second spot on the list of the world's healthiest countries. Their high-ranking healthcare system is the reason why the country has achieved good rankings in several health indices over the years, including this one.  Switzerland is home to one of the happiest populations. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum's 2013 Human Capital Report, Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world.  Home to the oldest living population in the world, Japan obviously has one of the highest life expectancies in the world! Other factors that contribute to Japan being in the top five are: their smaller portion sizes and protein-dense diet, their notoriously fast transportation, walking as the preferred mode of transportation and high cost of living matched with the price among other things.   Good healthcare system, healthy diet and clean water among other things such as low levels of smoking, makes Iceland one of the world's healthiest countries to live in. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162704", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34613", "source": "scrapy"},

Activists are determined to overshadow  , using the anniversary to step up their nearly four months of protests pushing for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability. Thousands marched through the streets of Hong Kong island on Tuesday afternoon, despite authorities rejecting an application to hold a rally there as police warned people \"to leave the scene as soon as possible\". Smaller crowds rallied in a number of other districts with clashes quickly breaking out. In Tsuen Wan, masked protesters used umbrellas and sticks to beat riot officers after they made a series of arrests. The officers retreated into a nearby town hall after they came under a barrage of projectiles. In Wong Tai Sin, police fired brief volleys of tear gas against protesters who had blocked nearby roads. The biggest march remained on Hong Kong island, a frequent battlefield between police and protesters where multiple malls and shops remained shuttered for the public holiday. \"Three months on and our five demands have yet to be achieved. We need to continue our fight,\" a protester, wearing a mask from the cult film and comic book \"V for Vendetta\", said. The protests came as lavish celebrations were taking place in Beijing, including a huge military parade through Tiananmen Square under the gaze of China's strongman President Xi Jinping. Among those watching the parade was Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who has historically low approval ratings at home as public anger boils over Beijing's increased control of the semi-autonomous city. Millions have hit the streets in record-breaking numbers while hardcore activists have repeatedly clashed with police, in the biggest challenge to China's rule since the city's 1997 handover by Britain. In a vivid illustration of the political insecurity now coursing through Hong Kong, city officials watched a morning harbourside flag-raising ceremony from the safety of the nearby convention centre. Since the 1997 handover, officials had always attended the ceremony outside, even during torrential downpours. But popular protests that erupted in June have made it increasingly risky for officials to appear in public. A flag-raising ceremony on July 1 -- the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover -- was also watched from indoors as protesters flooded the streets and later laid siege to the city's legislature. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung delivered an address in which he praised China's development over the last 70 years. But he said officials recognised they needed \"new thinking to try to address deep-rooted problems\" in Hong Kong. Throughout the morning police ramped up security checks and conducted frequent stop and searches while authorities announced the closure of a dozen subway stations. But the measures did little to halt crowds appearing in the afternoon. Rival pro-China rallies were also held. In the morning, a crowd of some 50 people waved flags and chanted \"Long live the motherland!\" \"We are Chinese and the whole nation is celebrating,\" Kitty Chan, 30, told AFP. Hong Kong's protests were initially sparked by a now scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland but have since snowballed into a much wider movement of popular anger against city leaders and Beijing.  Among the demands made by protesters is an inquiry into the police, an amnesty for the more than 1,500 people arrested and universal suffrage -- all of which have been rejected by Beijing and Lam.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/01/111854-untitled-design-7.jpg?itok=C87MYAci\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162704", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22154", "source": "scrapy"},

The law gives government ministers powers to order social media sites to put warnings next to posts authorities deem to be false, and in extreme cases get them taken down. Facebook, Twitter and Google - who have their Asian headquarters in Singapore - were given temporary exemptions from a handful of provisions in the act to give them time to adapt. If an action is judged to be malicious and damaging to Singapore's interests, companies could be hit with fines of up to $720,000, while individuals could face jail terms of up to 10 years. Authorities in the tightly controlled country - long criticised for restricting civil liberties - insist the measures are necessary to stop the circulation of falsehoods that could sow divisions in society and erode trust in institutions. But the laws have sparked outrage from rights groups, who fear they could stifle online discussion, tech companies and media organisations. Journalist and activist Kirsten Han, who is the Editor-in-Chief of independent media outlet New Naratif, said the legislation was \"extremely worrying\".  \"It’s such a broad law that it's hard to predict how it's going to be applied. What's of immediate concern is the chilling effect and the further entrenchment of self-censorship,\" she told AFP. After the law was passed in May, Google said it was concerned the legislation will \"hurt innovation and the growth of the digital information ecosystem\".

The move expands tightened restrictions put in place around the March 10 anniversary of a failed 1959 Tibetan uprising against rule by China, which marched into the formerly independent Himalayan country nine years before, a Tibetan living in exile told RFA. “The crackdown on individuals’ phones by the Chinese authorities has intensified recently,” said Golog Jigme, a former Tibetan political prisoner now living in Switzerland. “Anyone found with pictures of [exiled spiritual leader] the Dalai Lama or with documents related to events on March 10 or Tibetan issues generally is detained and punished,” Jigme added, citing information obtained from contacts inside Tibet. “My sources in Tibet do not feel free to share more detailed news though, or to identify anyone arrested by the Chinese or whose whereabouts are unknown,” Jigme said. Telecommunications offices set up in Tibetan villages now check on all conversations made over the phone, and police use the need to prevent the spread of COVID-19 as their excuse for stopping individuals for closer searches, Jigme said, adding, “That’s how Tibetans are scrutinized.” Chinese authorities in Tibet routinely maintain tight control over information flows in the region, arresting Tibetans for sharing news and opinions on social media and for contacting relatives living in exile, sometimes with news of anti-China protests, according to rights groups and other experts. Restrictions in Tibet’s regional capital Lhasa have meanwhile remained in place after the politically sensitive March 10 anniversary, a London-based Tibetan rights group says, with large numbers of Chinese police deployed around the Jokhang Temple and groups of more than three Tibetans barred from visiting the important pilgrimage site. “The Chinese government increased its oppressive security measures to avoid people marking their historical resistance to Chinese occupation. Now it appears to be making these restrictions permanent,” said John Jones, Campaigns and Advocacy Manager at Free Tibet, in a March 22 statement. “This constant escalation of constraints on the Tibetan way of life must result in foreign governments taking real action against the Chinese government,” Jones said. Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.

Go Sherab Gyatso, a 46-year-old monk at Kirti monastery in Sichuan’s Ngaba (in Chinese, Aba) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, was taken into custody by State Security agents on Oct. 26, 2020 in Sichuan’s capital Chengdu, a Tibetan living in exile with knowledge of the situation recently told RFA’s Tibetan Service, speaking on condition of anonymity. “My source in Tibet confirmed that Go Sherab Gyatso was arrested and his whereabouts are currently unknown,” the source in exile said. “The reason for his arrest is not clear and his family and friends are worried about him.” The source in exile said that Gyatso’s detention was unsurprising in that Chinese authorities “are constantly harassing Tibetans in Ngaba,” particularly those who have studied in India and returned home. “So many restrictions are in place when it comes to movement, as well as life in general,” he said. Chinese authorities exercise strict controls over phone and online communications in Tibetan areas, sources say, and news of Tibetan protests and arrests is often delayed, sometimes for years, from reaching outside contacts. Gyatso authored the book “We Need To Wake Up,” published in 2007 by Gansu Nationalities Press, and several articles detailing the restrictions on freedom of expression that Tibetans endure under Chinese rule. His book followed what reports have said was his four-year detention, beginning in 1998 during a “Patriotic Reeducation” campaign in Ngaba, for possessing a portrait of the Dalai Lama. Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama is widely reviled by Chinese leaders as a separatist intent on splitting Tibet, a formerly independent Himalayan country which was invaded and incorporated into China by force in 1950, from Beijing’s control. The Dalai Lama himself says only that he seeks a greater autonomy for Tibet as a part of China, though, with guaranteed protections for Tibet’s language, culture, and religion. Gyatso was also reportedly detained for a year in 2008 during a period of widespread unrest in Tibet, although the specific reasons for that detention were not immediately clear. RFA spoke with a Tibetan scholar in Tibet who called Gyatso “a very influential figure among the younger generation” of Tibetans. “He is considered a very open-minded person who speaks out about democracy and freedom, and believes that religion should not play any role in politics,” said the scholar, who also declined to be named, citing fear of reprisal.

Lobsang Sangay, a Harvard-trained scholar of law, has served two consecutive five-year terms as Sikyong, an office filled by candidates elected since 2011 by popular vote, and will leave that post when his present term expires in May. The Tibetan diaspora is estimated to include about 150,000 people living in 40 countries, mainly India, Nepal, North America, and in Europe. Penpa Tsering, a former speaker of Tibet’s exile parliament, and Aukatsang Kelsang Dorjee, a former representative of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama—frontrunners in the current race after prevailing in earlier voting—are pledging strengthened efforts to win greater freedom in Tibet, with plans for outreach to foreign governments and support groups worldwide. Tibet’s new Sikyong must continue to push for talks with China on greater autonomy for Tibet, “but I am not very hopeful that the Chinese government will initiate a dialogue with the Tibetan administration,” Aukatsang said, speaking to RFA’s Tibetan Service in a recent interview. “So we must work towards enhancing the Tibetan freedom struggle, and the Tibetan administration must focus more on that struggle than on the administration alone,” Aukatsang said. “Engaging and garnering support from the Indian government and its citizens is something I will work more towards.” Also speaking to RFA, Penpa Tsering promised to pursue “all possible ways to communicate with China, whether it’s directly or indirectly.” “But until Tibet’s issue is resolved, my primary focus of work will be to make sure that Tibetans inside Tibet are happy, and also to find ways to reject China’s assimilationist policies on Tibet’s language, culture, religion, and environment, along with the growing influx of Chinese [migrants] into Tibetan areas.” “These issues will remain the most important, and only after these will come the issue of looking after the welfare of the Tibetans living exile,” Tsering said. The May 14 election results will also seat 45 members of the exile Tibetan Parliament in its new, seventeenth session, with 10 candidates representing each of Tibet’s three traditional provinces—U-tsang, Kham, and Amdo—and two representatives from each of Tibet’s four major schools of Buddhism and the pre-Buddhist Bon religion. Two members will also be voted in to represent each of the exile Tibetan communities in North and South America and Europe, and one from Australia and Asia, excluding India, Nepal, and Bhutan. In interviews with RFA, Tibetan residents of India expressed different levels of familiarity with the candidates on offer, with some saying they were well informed, and others admitting to confusion. “I’ve thoroughly studied the background of all these candidates, because they will be representing six million Tibetans,” said Lobsang Lungtok, a resident of South India, including in that figure the number of Tibetans still estimated to be living in their traditional homeland. “I want honest and dedicated persons to be present [in parliament],” he said. “Because there are so many candidates running for parliament, I am very confused,” Tenzin Choekyi, another South India resident, said. “Therefore, I am relying on the news media and social media such as Facebook to help me make my decisions.” Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force 70 years ago, following which the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world. Divisions persist in the Tibetan exile community over how best to advance the rights and freedoms of Tibetans living in China, with some calling for a restoration of the independence lost when Chinese troops marched into Tibet in 1950. The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) and the Dalai Lama have instead adopted a policy approach called the Middle Way, which accepts Tibet’s status as a part of China but urges greater cultural and religious freedom, including strengthened language rights, for Tibetans living under Beijing’s rule. Both frontrunners in the current contest for Sikyong support the Middle Way. The outgoing Sikyong, Lobsang Sangay, has had some success in his two terms of office, winning an annual commitment from the United States of $9 million and a large grant from Congress to support the Tibetan exile community, two Western experts on Tibet wrote in a March 31 article in East Asia Forum. “But Sangay had no success in the exiles’ primary objective: persuading China to allow Tibet a ‘high degree of autonomy’ in return for the Dalai Lama accepting Chinese sovereignty over his former country,” said Robert Barnet, of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, and Cornell University’s Allen Carlson. The challenge facing Tibet’s exile leadership now will be to move away from media campaigns and appeals for legislative support to “detailed, pragmatic strategies demonstrating shared interests with [other] governments,” Barnett and Carlson wrote, adding that deepened relations with India’s leaders will be especially important. “But while India’s hospitality towards the exiles has been unwavering, its strategic interests generally converge with those of the exiles only when its relations with China sour,” they wrote. “A strategy needs to be developed that is seen by New Delhi as benefiting its interests in fair weather or foul,\" Barnet and Carlson said. Nine rounds of talks on greater autonomy in Tibetan areas of China were held between high-level Chinese officials and envoys of the Dalai Lama beginning in 2002, but stalled in 2010 and were never resumed.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162705", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12612", "source": "scrapy"},

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162705", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47703", "source": "scrapy"},

Raised earlier capital 2.5 years ago. Latest funds for Bombinate Technologies is led by a truly Indian investor 3one4 capital. Shunwei (single digit shareholder) which had invested in our Vokal journey will be exiting fully,\" Radhakrishna tweeted. The duo had launched online vernacular question and answer platform Vokal in 2017. That said, Koo's platform has a similar look and feel to Twitter, including the user interface. When it comes to the logo, Koo has a yellow bird as its mascot while Twitter has blue-coloured 'Larry' (inspired by popular basketball player, Larry Bird) representing the brand. A significant strength for Koo, however, is allowing users to post content in multiple Indian languages.   While ministers and government departments have been leveraging social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, there have been calls for homegrown platforms to emerge in this space, and apps like Koo could be likely beneficiaries. Minister of Railways, Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal on Tuesday tweeted that he was on Koo and asked people to connect with him. \"I am now on Koo. Connect with me on this Indian micro-blogging platform for real-time, exciting and exclusive updates. Let us exchange our thoughts and ideas on Koo,\" he had said. Goyal has already garnered over 91,800 followers on Koo. Later, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also tweeted about his presence on Koo. He now has over 33,000 followers.   IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad (over 5 lakh followers), Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya (over 23,000) and Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh (over 7,800 followers) are also present on Koo. The number of followers of these personalities has been soaring indicating the rising popularity of Koo. Besides, Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), MyGov, Digital India, India Post, National Informatics Centre (NIC), National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT), Common Services Centre, UMANG app, Digi Locker, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) and others have set up accounts on Koo. Anil Kumar Jain, CEO of NIXI (National Internet Exchange of India), also spoke of setting up presence on Koo.   \"It (Koo) appears to be a promising social media and I hope this will meet the objectives of both an individual and an enterprise. I am happy to inform that NIXI is present on Koo and would like to inform all our stakeholders including customers that you will continue to get latest information about NIXI on Koo platform,\" he said in a statement on Thursday.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162706", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17658", "source": "scrapy"},

Some moments and memories are so special that all it takes is a small sensory cue to take one to a different timeline of one's life. This is often captured by the expression 'madeleine de proust' one of the key passages in Marcel Proust book 'In search of lost time' when a particular sight, smell, food, a song, or an experience unexpectedly unlocks a past recollection. For instance, the smell of jasmine flowers reminds me of my grandmother and how fondly she used to place them near her pillow. It's not uncommon when a simple song triggers a plethora of past memories. No wonder when sometimes I miss my mother near me, I try to do or make something exactly the way she does to intentionally create a madeleine moment and then soak myself in the nostalgia and priceless feelings associated with childhood memories. The reverse is also true. There are events or moments of life thinking about which can make one feel awful. It could be related to anything in the past like the unexpected loss of a loved one, changing dynamics of cherished relationships, emotionally taxing incidents or the struggles in the present moment that instantly makes one negative. Sometimes when a negative situation stays for too long, it can leave one overwhelmed in a way that the person seems to be addicted to negativity or develops a habit of ruminating. For instance, acting as a caregiver where hopes are not high, clinging to a toxic relationship or sticking with the wrong job because of one's helpless condition perceived or real. Rumination is continuously getting lost in a thought loop where you eventually end up thinking about that same negative or sad thought or experience. Why is it that we end up remembering what we want to forget? Perhaps negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that even when an individual has made a conscious thought to not pay heed to it, it keeps coming back. One of the reasons people ruminate is owing to the belief that by ruminating they will probably get an insight into their life or problem. However, it doesn't work out because in a state of ruminating the person is focused more on the problems and consequences instead of solutions. The person may perceive it as natural coping mechanism to adapt with the pain, but one has to ponder whether it's helping one solve a problem or just trapping back in an unhealthy thought cycle. Dwelling on negative thoughts and engaging in self-blame has been associated with mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Research by Peter Kinderman professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they had experienced many negative events in their lives. The question is how to intentionally forget things that only serve to disturb us. Can we exercise influence on our memory? Perhaps the easiest way to forget something is not revisiting it in your mind. There are many theories related to the process of motivated forgetting that suggest that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. According to Freud, memories that are likely to induce guilt, embarrassment, shame or anxiety are actively, but unconsciously, pushed out of consciousness as a form of ego defence. Unconscious or repressed memories are exceedingly difficult to retrieve but remain available. People may resort to 'repression' in which they subconsciously push unpleasant thoughts and feelings into their unconscious as an automatic defensive mechanism. Thought 'suppression' is also a  type of motivated forgetting when an individual consciously attempts to stop thinking about a particular thought. Memories are also forgotten through distortion as perGestalt theory of forgetting. This is also called false memory syndrome in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by false memories, recollections that are factually incorrect but yet are strongly believed. Rehearsing negative memories by ruminating over them only serve to strengthen them, so it's important to forget certain things to live life peacefully. Apparently, we may never forget things completely but when we stop thinking about them, it often fades away as we remember fewer facts. If rumination is affecting your personal growth stop and take notice of the circumstances and triggers that lead you to ruminate. Eliminating the trigger may not be possible always but by practicing mindfulness one can consciously try to respond with an element of awareness breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. This may require consistent practice and conscious efforts but it's important to check yourself lest negativity pulls you into a trap again. Finding a distraction like going for a walk, playing a game, calling a friend, watching a movie or getting engaged in any activity that breaks the chain can also be helpful. If constant rumination is disabling you and you are unable to focus your attention on other important things of life, seeking therapy can be beneficial. Otherwise meditating can also reduce rumination because it helps in de cluttering the mind to arrive at an emotionally calm state. Life is fleeting and made up of a collection of moments. Clinging on to negative experiences will only make us miss out on the beauty of 'now'.Next time if your answer to this question 'Do you remember what you want to forget?' carries away your mind to unpleasant memories and events, change the question itself. Ask yourself - 'Do you forget what you want to remember?' Answering it will not only break the thought cycle and distract your mind but transport you to all the beautiful memories and the blessings in the present moment, that perhaps money can't buy but fills the heart with gratitude.

Nguyen Tuong Thuy, an independent journalist and former RFA Vietnamese Service blogger, was moved earlier this year from a Ho Chi Minh City Police detention center and sent to the Bo La prison in Binh Duong province, sources told RFA in an earlier report. Thuy, 71, is older than many of the other inmates held at Bo La, and is often last in line when the prison canteen is opened for purchases of food, the wife of a former fellow prisoner told RFA’s Vietnamese Service on Tuesday after speaking with her husband the week before by phone. “He is slower than the others and can’t catch up, and by the time he arrives there, nothing has been left for him to buy,” said Huynh Thi Kim Nga, the wife of Thuy’s former cellmate Ngo Van Dung. Transferred on March 29 from Bo La and sent to An Phuoc Prison, also in Binh Duong, Dung told his wife on April 1 that a painful injury to Thuy’s hand has left him unable to do anything for himself. “When my husband was there, he could help Thuy, but now he wonders if anyone is still there who will help,” Nga said, adding that Thuy and other prisoners held at Bo La on political charges are refused permission to receive family visits or to talk to relatives on the phone. Speaking to RFA on Tuesday, Thuy’s wife Nguyen Thi Lan expressed concern at the news of her husband’s health, saying that even though suffering high blood pressure at home, “he had never relied on others to serve him” and went himself to buy over-the-counter medications. “As for his injured hand, I believe that is the due to the wrench he received from the security officers on the day they arrested him and forced him to give them the code to open his mobile phone,” she said. “His hand was already hurting him before at the Phan Dang Luu detention center,” Lan said, adding, “I have bought medication to be sent in to him, but I don’t know if he’s receiving the right medication.” Lan, who lives in Hanoi, had tried to visit Thuy at Bo La near Ho Chi Minh City on March 25, but was turned away by prison guards citing COVID-19 concerns and instructions from city police, Lan told RFA in an earlier report. Even with concerns over COVID-19, the guards should have allowed her to see her husband at a distance or speak to him on the phone, Lan said. Repeated calls by RFA seeking comment from Bo La Prison have rung unanswered. Thuy, who had blogged on civil rights and freedom of speech issues for RFA’s Vietnamese Service for six years, was sentenced on Jan. 5 with two other bloggers—like Thuy members of the Vietnam Independent Journalists’ Association—who were handed lengthy jail terms at the same time. Arrested in May 2020, Thuy was indicted along with Pham Chi Dung and Le Huu Minh Tuan on Nov. 10 for “making, storing, and disseminating documents and materials for anti-state purposes” under Article 117 of Vietnam’s Penal Code. Sentenced with Thuy, Pham Chi Dung was given a 15-year prison term, while Le Huu Minh Tuan was jailed for 11 years. Thuy later refused to appeal his sentence, tearing up a petition form given to his after prison guards told him what to write on it, Thuy’s lawyer told RFA in an earlier report. A Vietnamese blogger held in a mental hospital while awaiting trial for criticizing Vietnam’s one-party communist state is meanwhile being given dangerously high doses of medication to treat his supposed mental illness, sources told RFA this week. Le Anh Hung, a member of the online Brotherhood of Democracy advocacy group who had blogged for Voice of America, was arrested on July 5, 2018 on a charge of “abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state” under Article 331 of Vietnam’s criminal code. He was later transferred in April 2019 from jail to Hanoi’s Central Mental Hospital No. 1 for “observation and treatment.” If convicted at trial, he could serve up to seven years in prison. Speaking to RFA on April 5, Hung’s mother Tran Thi Niem said that Hung had recently called her on a borrowed phone to say he is being forced to take much higher doses of medication than usual. “He spoke to me the day before yesterday and told me that the dose of medication he is being given has now been increased to 12 pills per day,” Niem said. “I said this was a potentially fatal dose, and asked one of Hung’s friends, Nguyen Van Binh, to put out an urgent call for intervention on the internet.” Writing on his Facebook page on April 4, Binh condemned the hospital’s treatment of his friend. “This morning I got the phone call from Niem, Hung’s mother. She told me that the hospital had increased his daily dose to 12 pills, and that if he resisted taking it, he was tied up and injected with sedatives,” he said. “This is so barbaric and wicked!” Binh said. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Vietnam 175 out of 180 in its 2020 World Press Freedom Index. About 25 journalists and bloggers are being held in Vietnam’s jails, “where mistreatment is common,” the Paris-based watchdog group said. Vietnam’s already low tolerance of dissent deteriorated sharply last year with a spate of arrests of independent journalists, publishers, and Facebook personalities as authorities continued to stifle critics in the run-up to the ruling Communist Party Congress in January.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162705", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13127", "source": "scrapy"},

Shultz liked to refer to him as “Buddha” because of his calm demeanor in the face of world crises. Shultz, who died on Feb. 6 at the age of 100, was perhaps best known for working with President Ronald Reagan to help end the Cold War. It’s not easy to sum up the career of a statesman who served for six and a half years as Secretary of State during a time of turmoil overseas. His was the longest tenure since that served by Dean Rusk. Rusk served for eight years, from early 1961 until January 20, 1969. Shultz held four different cabinet positions under Presidents Nixon and Reagan. Paul Wolfowitz, who served as an assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 1982 until 1986 does one of the best jobs of  briefly describing Shultz’s career and impact. In a commentary written for   on February 9 under the headline “Statesman of the Century,” Wolfowitz said that Shultz “was perhaps the 20  century’s most consequential secretary of state, a group that includes George Marshall, Dean Acheson, and Henry Kissinger.” Upon his appointment as Secretary of State, Shultz and President Ronald Reagan immediately agreed on continuing arms sales to Taiwan. This was in line with Reagan’s lifelong support for Taiwan. In 1982, Shultz also pushed for President Reagan to establish relations with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. This led to a thaw in the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Then between 1985 and 1989, with Shultz’s help, Reagan forged a relationship with Gorbachev that brought a peaceful end to the Cold War. Reagan held his first meeting with Gorbachev in Geneva on Nov. 19, 1985. They discussed the Cold War arms race and the possibility of reducing the number of nuclear weapons that their countries possessed. As noted by John Lewis Gaddis, a professor of military history at Yale University, foreign policy experts at the time worried that Reagan, whose roots lay in movies, television, and advertising, “viewed the world through dangerous simplicities.” But Gaddis argues that, like Franklin D. Roosevelt, Reagan was “an instinctive grand strategist, fully capable of operating without policy planners.” “He saw more clearly than his advisors the   of actions, together with the conditions of constituencies necessary to get him where he wanted to go, said Gaddis in his book about the diplomat George F. Kennan. Reagan, Gaddis said, “refused to let complications obscure destinations, or to make conventional wisdom a compass.” George Shultz was able to help Reagan find ways to deal with such complications What people might best remember about Reagan, of course, was his challenge to Gorbachev during a visit to Berlin on June 12, 1987 when he urged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. But Shultz and Reagan’s success in dealing with Gorbachev was based in part on Shultz’s early recognition that Gorbachev was a new type of Russian leader.  Reagan and Shultz used the issue of freedom for Soviet Jewry to test for Soviet intentions on nuclear disarmament. Eventually, as Gorbachev allowed more freedoms in Russia, the communist system dissolved without a shot being fired. My small claim to fame in Shultz’s history as Secretary of State involved something that I wrote about him as he assumed that role. I was working as the diplomatic correspondent for   at the time.  Shultz drew on my comments in his autobiography, where he noted that I wrote in   of July 15, 1982, that “George Shultz faces a world in turmoil, and the world will not wait.” “Rarely,” I wrote, “has a new secretary of state had to deal with so many upheavals occurring in so many places around the world.” “He was right,” said Shultz.  “As I headed for my confirmation hearings”, he said, “the world was in turmoil, and creative engagement from the United States of America was desperately needed.” Albert M. Haig Jr., Shultz’s predecessor as secretary of state, appeared to be eager to sell weapons to China as a signal to the Soviet Union that a Chinese-American alliance was moving a step closer. On June 18, 1981, I was among a group of reporters covering a trip by Haig to Asia a decade after the historic visit to China by President Richard Nixon. After a stop in Beijing, Haig spoke enthusiastically about a Reagan administration decision to allow the sale of arms to China. It was later revealed that in the summer of 1973 Michael Pillsbury of the RAND Corporation had already been conducting secret talks with Chinese military officers stationed under diplomatic cover at China’s United Nations mission in New York. This was the genesis of the idea of a “China Card” that the United States might use to gain a Cold War advantage over the Soviet Union. In 1986, President Reagan decided to arm the Afghan resistance to the Soviets with Stinger missiles, according to the Undersecretary-General who negotiated the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. But unlike his predecessor Al Haig, who was heavily focused on forming an alliance with China against the Soviet Union, George Shultz was looking for ways to talk with the Soviets. Haig was still fighting the Cold War. Shultz was about to help bring it to an end by arranging a meeting for President Reagan with the Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland. Reagan and Shultz used the issue of freedom for Soviet Jewry to test for Soviet intentions on nuclear disarmament. They came close to reaching an agreement with Gorbachev under which nuclear arms on both sides would be dismantled. We now know based on newly released documents obtained by     that that a “nuclear scare” occurred in 1983 when the Soviet Union put fighter-bombers loaded with nuclear bombs on 24-hour alert in East Germany. It was during this period that President Reagan referred to the Soviet Union as an “evil empire” and launched a Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to build a space-based missile defense. He believed that  the SDI would render nuclear weapons obsolete. In many of Reagan’s meetings with Gorbachev he would at the outset pull out a list of the names of Soviet Jews who had been refused visas or had been sent to prison because of their activities. According to a National Public Radio report summarizing these meetings, Reagan would say, “Well if you want to talk, first we have to discuss these names.” Gorbachev complied, easing immigration restraints so that Soviet Jews could leave Russia in large numbers.    Eventually, as Gorbachev allowed more freedoms in Russia, the communist system collapsed without a shot being fired. Shultz and Reagan’s success in dealing Gorbachev was based on Shultz’s early recognition that Gorbachev was a new type of Russian leader. From early on Reagan himself recognized that he needed to reach out to the Soviets either to pressure them on various issues or to achieve agreements. Meanwhile, Shultz and Reagan, also early on, agreed to continue arms sales to Taiwan. This was in line with Reagan’s lifelong support for Taiwan. Given his experience as an executive at the Bechtel Corporation, Shultz knew how to run a big organization, such as the State Department. He began by working to restore morale at the State, which had declined under Henry Kissinger’s leadership. As David Brown, a former State Department official who served both in Washington, D.C. after Shultz had departed, and in Asia, said, “there was a consensus in the Department when I served there (1990-96) that of all  the secretaries in memory, none cared more about the building and tending State as an institution than Shultz did.” “As compared, for example, with Kissinger, who built himself a replica of the National Security Council on the 7  Floor and pretty much ignored all the work going on below decks,” said Brown in an email exchange with this commentator. Shultz’s approach was to walk around the State Department building and drop in unannounced on working-level officials—and not those at the highest level—to ask, “How’s it going?” Phyllis Oakley, a now retired foreign-service official who served as spokesperson for the State Department when Shultz was there, recalls that the officials in one office asked Shultz, “Where are your people?” They wanted to know why Shultz wasn’t being trailed by the high-level officials who usually accompanied a Secretary of State when he moved around the building. Shultz responded, “You are my people.” After leaving the government, Shultz maintained an office at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution in California and continued to speak up on a variety of issues, including national security, the economy, and environmental issues.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162707", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "14349", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.financialexpress.com", "section": "Industry", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/partial-lockdown-measures-could-impact-movement-of-labour-goods-cii-survey/2230942/", "title": "Partial lockdown measures could impact movement of labour, goods: CII survey", "author": null, "author_link": "https://www.financialexpress.com/author/pti/", "published_date": "April 11, 2021 1:52 PM", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Covid curfew and micro containment strategies along with Covid-appropriate behaviour are effective to contain the spread of the second wave of infections, the survey by industry body CII suggested.", "text": "", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://images.financialexpress.com/2021/04/covid-19-lockdown.jpg\" alt=\"covid 19 lockdown\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162658", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "27369", "source": "scrapy"},

Hence, he decided to begin gardening on his terrace as well, to have a relatively cool roof. Up until 2008, the 58-year-old IT professional had been leading a hectic lifestyle. Once he retired, his aim has been to concentrate on his health. “I was working 18 hours and driving around five hours a day. My specially-abled wife and two daughters needed me. Hence, I quit to focus on my health and family,” he says. Hailing from a farming family in Parampalli in Udupi, he decided to go back to his roots, and pursue his love for gardening and nature. “I’d spent years of my childhood growing plants with my father. Even before I began pursuing engineering, I used to maintain the plants in our balcony,” he recalls. Banking on this previous experience, Nataraja began growing plants in rice bags and discarded containers. “I started by growing a few vegetables and medicinal plants. My home has a terrace of around 1,500 sq-ft, which opened the potential to grow bigger plants and trees. So by 2012, I started growing trees in recycled 55-litre drums,” he says. Over the past years, Nataraja’s consistent efforts have seen the growth of 300 varieties of plants, including 100 trees of 72 species, creepers, fruit trees, and vegetables. The terrace has a dense green cover, with trees including moringa, bamboo, drumstick, tamarind, and wild fig.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://images.thequint.com/thequint%2F2021-04%2F5ff6fa92-85be-45a2-a9da-e909160a1027%2FDrum.jpg?rect=24%2C0%2C780%2C439&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;fmt=webp&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Nataraja says, thanks to the jungle on the terrace he does not require a fan during the summer months in Bengaluru.&amp;nbsp;\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162658", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The global index rates 158 countries on their readiness for frontier technologies \r\nbased on five building blocks: information and communication technologies (ICT) deployment, skills, research and development (R&D), industry activity and \r\naccess to finance. Frontier technologies are those that take advantage of digitalisation and connectivity. They include artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things, big data, block chain, 5G, 3D printing, robotics, drones, gene editing, nanotechnology and solar photovoltaic.   The Unctad report finds that a few developing nations are exhibiting stronger capabilities to use, adopt and adapt frontier technologies than their per capita GDPs would suggest. \"The greatest over performer is India, whose actual index ranking was 43, while the estimated one based on per capita income was 108. Hence, India over performed by 65 ranking positions. It is followed by the Philippines, which over performed by 57 ranking positions,\" says the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Over-performance is measured as the difference between the actual index rankings and the estimated index rankings based on per capita income. Ukraine, Vietnam and China are also in the top five over-performers.   Outliers like India and China exceeded expectations by performing well for R&D. This reflects their abundant supplies of qualified and highly skilled human resources available at a comparatively low cost.

The Philippines has a high ranking for industry, reflecting high levels of foreign direct investment in high-technology manufacturing, particularly electronics. Multinational enterprises are attracted by the country's strong supply chains and solid base of parts manufacturing.

It would have acted as the counterweight to the Saudi-born fundamentalist Wahhabism. And it would have been, largely, an Indian contribution. This is the thesis of Ghazala Wahab’s timely book that is simultaneously a ready-reckoner for Islam as well as an appeal to moderate Muslims to reclaim their faith. Wahab’s urgent intervention pertains to the current moral crisis afflicting Muslims who number over 1.9 billion and form about 25 per cent of the globe. Written in crisp prose filtered through a lens of empathy and humour, her quest to examine Islam draws equally on scripture, memoir and reportage. She interviews the who’s who of Muslim India from politicians and bureaucrats to seminary heads and theologians. But she also has her ear to the ground, and is careful to catch every dilemma and strand of opinion of the common man and woman, be they a humble tradesman, the “new Muslim” or the successful professional, a dadi at Shaheen Bagh or a young student at the madrassa.   So far, the discourse on the Islamic question has been chiefly contained in the West, conducted as it has been by the likes of Susan Okin (“Feminism and Multiculturalism: Some Tensions”), Ayaan Hirsi Ali (maker of  , belonging to the alt-right camp), Irshad Manji (founder of the Muslim refusenik movement), Ameena Wadud and “ex-Muslim” Sarah Haider. Barring Hasan Suroor’s important 2019 work, however, this is the first book coming out of India capturing this discourse as it plays out in this country. The last fact makes it all the more accessible to the lay reader.   The reader, for instance, may be aware that much of the problems of the moderate Indian Muslim stems from their religious obligation to follow the Muslim orthodoxy, the ulema. But did they know that, as a phenomenon, the overarching influence of the mullahs is fairly recent? It began only after the collapse of the Mughal empire, before which the influence of the Sufis who were championed by the emperor was more widespread. The predominant view about Sufism is that it exists outside Islam as a cult born out of the admixture of Hinduism with the Prophet’s faith. But this is self-serving propaganda spread by two sources, the prejudiced West which failed to reconcile the sophistication of Sufi writings with what, in its view, was a “desert religion”, and the Islamic orthodoxy itself. The origin of Sufism much predated its presence in India. Hazrat Rabia of Basra died in AD 801.     Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (AD 1058-1111) was the first scholar to lend theological heft to Sufi mysticism, marrying it with Sharia. While Golden Age (Abbasid) philosophers like Averroes and Avicenna were among the first Muslim rationalists, it was Ghazali who arguably laid the foundation of Islamic heterodoxy. He said that as long as one believed in Allah and Muhammad, Islam could be practised in different ways. Nevertheless, this ruled out the philosophy of atheism. Neither of the Abrahamic religions is known to accommodate it. Until a generation ago, there were two kinds of Muslims in India, the Communists and the conformists, Wahab says. The conformists were the regular moderate Muslims. If sceptic, they were careful to hide their worldview from the ulema. For them, the personal was not political. The Communists, on the other hand, identified as agnostic. They were, at best, cultural Muslims. While they had been drawn to this ideology because it resonated with the Islamic ideals of equality and justice, since they did not identify as true-blue Musalman, within their community, their voices went unheard. Nor did they themselves find it important to address the dogma and bigotry from within by, say, reforming the clergy. Thus Wahab illustrates the failure of Left politics to address the fundamental reality of identity as well as the Islamic problem.   Now, if Wahab is critical of Hindutva and Saudi preponderance on the clergy, she is equally irked by the Congress governments’ minority politics. Citing Wajahat Habibullah’s 2016 article, she mentions M.J. Akbar’s role in the passage of the Rajiv Gandhi government’s infamous 1986 Muslim women’s bill. It was Akbar who had prevailed on Rajiv Gandhi to contest the Shah Bano judgment, saying that if he did not, it would appear that the Prime Minister did not regard the Muslim community as his own. Akbar was subsequently seen expanding this point in a Doordarshan debate against Arif Mohammad Khan.   The Hadith is contextual, writes the author, as is the Quran. The custodians of the faith need to move with the times in order to prevent the religion from atrophying. But what if one differs from the holy book in one’s analysis of context? Is it not bowing to stereotype to regard the status of women as subhuman in tribal Arabia before the arrival of the Prophet? If so, what of the example of Khadija, the Prophet’s first wife? Should have the Prophet’s wives and honest, thereby more capable, women, rather than the already less powerful slave women, been robbed of their agency to operate in the cause of good via physical encumbrance only so as to distinguish one group from the other? Is covering up also either a moral or an ultimately effective way to combat sexist aggression? There are no easy answers. These are some areas that the book does not go into.   Elsewhere, the author does write that the opportunity for freethinking is limited when exercised from within the Islamic faith. Liberal Islam may indeed be an oxymoron, by that token. All the same, it is interesting to note how key definitions from other faiths sit perfectly inside it. The author’s own liberal rationalism is the Buddhist way of the instinct- and deed-driven mahayana, while the orthodoxy’s essentialism would be the intellect-driven hinayana way. Quite startlingly, the Hindu dichotomy of   (dual and singular manifestations of God) also exists within Islam because the Naqshbandiyah order of Sufism rejects the Chishti and other silsila on the ground that the identification of the self with Allah is subjective and does not produce any objective manifestation, hence leading to idolatry.   The author’s caveat is that the moderate Muslim even today has no voice or traction within the larger Muslim society. They are caught between the Hindu right wing that regards them as exceptional and thus invisibilises them and the Muslim right wing which disparages them for their apologism. She exhorts these people to give up their conformism and take responsibility for their beliefs. Simultaneously, she notes a rise of Muslim exceptionalism and reverse identity politics among community members in reaction to Hindutva, as evidenced in the   sloganeering during the 2019 CAA protests.   “Young working professionals are overnight discovering headscarves. The more one points to the headscarf as a symbol of Islamic patriarchy or women’s oppression, the more professional women turn up in one to register their protest.” (p. 367) Such an assertion of identity leads to the closedness of the mind in a way that runs contrary to freedom and modernism, she surmises. Clearly, a gap exists between expressions of Muslim identity and its spirit of fearless large-heartedness. It is this gap that the book strives to fill. And in so doing it perhaps becomes the vehicle through which the writer bears her own shahadah to her Muslim heritage.   By Ghazala Wahab Aleph, Rs 999", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/1c2e1c94a6acfdf3c4868602b120840eaf249bef-tc-img-columnists.jpg\" class=\"mugShotHome\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162711", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "21670", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.asianage.com:443", "section": "india", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asianage.com:443/india/all-india/090421/focus-on-vaccine-festival-from-april-11-14-modi-to-cms.html", "title": null, "author": "VINEETA PANDEY WITH AGENCY INPUTS", "author_link": "/byline/vineeta-pandey-with-agency-inputs", "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Centre playing politics by giving more vaccines to BJP-ruled states and fewer to non-BJP governed states, says Maharashtra health minister", "text": "On a day India recorded about 1.32 lakh fresh cases of Covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conferred with the Chief Ministers of several states in virtual mode to discuss the surging Covid-19 infections and the vaccine strategy. He told the Chief Ministers to strengthen their efforts for the next 2-3 weeks to check the spread of the virus on a “war-footing” and to focus on vaccinations and testing and hold a special drive — ‘vaccine festival’— from April 11 to 14 to cover all eligible beneficiaries over 45. He also asked the states to prevent vaccine wastage.   He defended the eligibility criteria for vaccination amid demand by some states, ruled by Opposition parties, to open the vaccination for all above 18 years. India's criteria is no different from the most prosperous countries in the world, Modi said. States like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Haryana and Chhattisgarh have complained to the Centre regarding the shortage of oxygen, remdesivir and vaccine supply and said the vaccine drive will be severely impacted due to this.  Union health minister Harsh Vardhan dismissed these allegations, saying enough vaccines had been given to the states. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister took the second dose of Covaxin at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, meanwhile, tested positive for Covid-19. He had taken the first dose of the vaccine on March 3.   Addressing the meeting, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said his state has vaccine supply only till Friday, while several vaccine centres in Maharashtra had to be closed for the want of vaccines. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday attacked the Centre for playing politics during the pandemic by giving more vaccines to BJP-ruled states and fewer to non-BJP governed states.  He accused the Centre of giving Maharashtra only 7.5 lakh doses against its demand for 40 lakh vaccines. The minister said the state was aiming to vaccinate five to six lakh people daily to break the chain of transmission.  Tope also held meetings with the manufacturers of Covid-19 drug Remdesivir and asked them to double the production for the state. In order to increase beds for patients, the Pune administration has tied up with the Army Hospital to provide 40 ICU beds.   Health minister Harsh Vardhan said: “The hue and cry by certain states about partisanship by the Union government is just a farce, an attempt to hide their own incompetence. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are two of the top three states based on the allocation of Covid-19 vaccine doses. Both are non-BJP governed states. Let’s put an end to the fear-mongering now! Covid-19 vaccine doses: Total administered: 9 crore plus, in stock/nearing delivery to states: 4.3 crore plus. Where does the question of shortages arise? We’re continuously monitoring and enhancing supply.”  According to him, Maharashtra was given 1.06 crore vaccine doses, Gujarat 1.05 crore and Rajasthan 1.04 crore, while the country’s average distribution was 37.11 lakh.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162711", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17362", "source": "scrapy"},

Their stupendous performance in last year’s IPL earned them a ticket to Team India. Their inclusion has once accentuated the significance of playing well in the IPL. But unfortunately, the competition was so intense that neither of them could find a place in the playing X1 in the ODI team. Krunal Pandya replaced Suryakumar Yadav for the ODIs; in fact, the latter made his ODI debut against England last Tuesday and scored a record 26-ball 50. \r\nSimilarly, despite some good performances, K.L. Rahul is facing stiff competition from Rishab Pant as a wicket-keeping batsman.   And with the next edition of IPL set to happen next month, more new faces are likely to emerge, putting existing performers in trouble. Ishan and Suryakumar were among the 12 batsmen who scored 350-plus runs in last year’s IPL. Naturally, they were drafted into the National side for the recent T-20 series against England. Cricket administrator and former Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) for Kolkata Knight Riders Makarand Waingankar agrees that IPL has helped many cricketers to play for Team India. He adds that the format has given the players a great opportunity to play against international cricketers much before they make their international debut.   “Youngsters have become fearless because of their IPL stints. The situation is so dynamic that it has become challenging for players to retain their spots in the team,” points out Makarand, and adds that sometimes even top performers have to be dropped because of the competition. “Team India won matches in Australia even without Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, etc. But now if they come back, where do you slot them?” he asks. While former greats like Sachin Tendulkar, M.S. Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, etc., had the luxury of playing the game almost till their 40s, the situation for the current crop looks grim. At a time where even performers are being left out due to high competition, cricketers’ longevity on the field is in jeopardy.   Sports analyst and historian Sunil Yashkalra describes the current situation as a ‘problem of plenty’. Commenting that league tournaments are the germination points of talent, he feels having a long stint like Dhoni, Sachin and Yuvraj could be difficult these days. “Today, longevity depends on not just skill but on temperament and fitness,” shares Sunil. He feels intense fitness will be the key differentiator for longevity in the game. “Vihari has done so well, but just one injury, and he is out of the team. And with the IPL taking place next month, the competition is even more intense, it makes things even tougher. Hence it is significant that a player stays injury-free,” he stresses.   Former Indian cricketer and former coach of the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, Lalchand Rajput, reminisces that during his tenure, fitness was never a parameter. During the ’80s there wasn’t much emphasis on fitness, but only skill, he explains, adding that today, a player first needs to be an athlete to make the cut. Observers feel that while Team India may not soon see the likes of Sachin, Sehwag and Dhoni who played for several years, the BCCI should follow a strict rotation policy, where a mandatory rest is given to players after taking part in a certain number of matches.   Former cricketer and Chief selector M.S.K. Prasad says that before he took charge, there were only 20 players playing all three formats (Test, ODI and T-20). He had visualized developing sustainable bench strength over a period of time to nurture the team to where it is now. “Bench strength (competition) will certainly challenge senior players’ longevity. With youngsters chipping in, it will also push seniors to perform better, so eventually, it will help Team India,” explains Prasad, who points out that Indian won the test series against Australia despite not having its seven main players.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162711", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17213", "source": "scrapy"},

Amidst a national lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery.   On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American's lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US. Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31. He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.   The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country. No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday mid-night, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House will not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday.   Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban. I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today, Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden. The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work  and millions more desperate to make ends meet  now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources, he wrote.   In his letter, Hawley wrote that the unemployment rate remains at 6.2 per cent  with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis  and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions, he said. In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers.   I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programmes to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm, Hawley added.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162711", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17476", "source": "scrapy"},

China has struggled with power shortages since the start of the winter heating season due to unusually cold weather, which strained coal supplies. The crunch has been complicated by growing demand from economic recovery and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which slowed domestic coal production and transport to power plants. But the problems have not prevented China's government from pursuing a political agenda against Australia despite a free trade agreement between the two countries since 2015. Although it had experienced customs clearance delays at Chinese ports as far back as 2018, Australia remained China's leading foreign coal supplier until the ban was officially confirmed last year. In 2019, Australia accounted for some 57 percent of China's thermal coal imports and 40 percent of coking coal for steelmaking, the S    said. Despite electricity rationing in some areas, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) formalized its coal ban policy at a mid-December meeting with 10 power companies. At the meeting, the top planning agency authorized the companies \"to import coal without clearance restrictions, except for Australia,\" according to the Communist Party's tabloid  . Since then, Beijing has remained intent on punishing Australia for a long list of differences, ranging from its decision to bar Chinese telecom giants from developing its 5G networks to its support for investigating the origins of COVID-19. In November, China issued a list of 14 grievances against Australia including investment restrictions and \"siding with\" the United States, the Daily   said. The coal clash has been costly for Australia, which previously relied on China for about one-third of its foreign trade. On Feb. 8, Bloomberg News reported that 61 bulk carriers loaded with Australian coal have been anchored outside Chinese ports waiting to unload with crews stranded for months at a time. The standoff has also proved costly for China, but accounts differ as to how much. On Feb. 10,   reported that \"China's ban on Australian coal imports is intensifying a crisis in its coal market, which is battling surging prices, supply shortages, conflicting policy goals and a cold winter.\" \"China's coal war with Australia fuels shortage at home,\" the   headline read. But in an online column, China energy expert Philip Andrews-Speed argued that the exclusion of Australian coal is likely to be only a contributing factor in China's power problems. \"The issue of the embargo on Australian coal does not merit much attention in Chinese commentaries,\" said Andrews- Speed, a senior principal fellow at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute. \"This high quality coal accounts for just 3 percent of the coal used by Chinese power plants, though this share is higher in the richer coastal provinces,\" he said. \"The underlying problem is the unexpected soaring demand as China's economy has recovered, along with tighter environmental constraints,\" Andrews-Speed said by email. Whatever the reasons, thermal coal prices have climbed 84 percent since mid-2020, the   reported, raising the related but separate issue of affordability. \"The ban on Australian coal imports has exacerbated this problem. Prices would have risen anyway, but not as much,\" Andrews-Speed said. Singling out the Australian coal ban as a factor may come down to orders of magnitude. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal as well as the leading importer. While imports of nearly 304 million metric tons rose 1.3 percent last year, according to official figures, domestic production of 3.84 billion tons also increased 0.9 percent. The proportions of China's massive production make it a far greater factor in the country's supplies. It can be argued that any import curb may be influential in a supply crisis, but China's power strains seem to stem from transmission problems in a system with surplus generating capacity, making it less responsive to recovery- driven demand. Reports suggest that China has also been trying to offset the loss of Australian coal by turning to other suppliers including Indonesia, South Africa, and Colombia. The   has highlighted new shipments of both coal and iron ore from Sierra Leone, calling them \"a sign that does not bode well for Australia, as it shows how easily China could replace Australia with alternative import sources.\" But the substitutions have not spared China from repercussions. Higher prices, longer distances, and quality problems have raised costs for power companies and the steel industry. Impurities in South African coal and the logistics of Colombian supplies are seen as drawbacks for generators. \"That China has embraced thermal coal from both countries in recent months underscores just how unwilling it is to trade with one of its biggest coal suppliers: Australia,\" the   said. Alternate sources of coking coal are also more costly. \"The mills are therefore paying a lot more for generally lesser quality coal ... putting immense pressure on their margins and profitability,\"     said. China's choices on the embargo lead to questions that have yet to meet with obvious answers. Are the costs to the power and steel industries so high that they could outweigh the government's interest in imposing sanctions on Australia? Or, are the costs still seen as manageable in the two key industries that benefit from government subsidies? In November, China's Ministry of Commerce announced steep anti-dumping duties on Australian wine in a move that allowed it to easily offset the loss with imports from elsewhere. The wine ban added to unofficial curbs on imports of Australian barley, sugar, logs, lobster, copper, and other commodities, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said. But one possible answer to the question of affordability is that China's animus toward Australia has grown so strong that it will disrupt trade and investment ties regardless of cost. That interpretation may be beyond the scope of economics, but it may have implications for China's other trading partners that take exception to its policies, its narrative of the pandemic origins, or its human rights practices. Beijing may be willing to suffer the costs of continuing the embargo on Australian coal if it serves to warn other countries that their trade could be at risk if they differ over China's political concerns. Earlier this month, a Bloomberg News report briefly raised hopes for a break in the coal ban after sources said China would allow some of the stranded coal carrying vessels to unload at Chinese ports. But the report suggested that the move was aimed only at relieving some of the foreign crews after months on board. On Feb. 11, the   reported there was no indication that any of the Australian cargoes had received customs clearance. The mixed decisions have given China the chance to show its humanitarian side while maintaining the threat of its trade sanctions at the same time. As it stands, China appears prepared to continue its ban on Australian coal indefinitely, letting it serve as an affordable proxy for its political disputes with the West.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162711", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13113", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the first time that any animals have been added to the list in 32 years. Many of the new protected species are birds. Wolves were also added to the list for the first time. Under new rules, harming any one of the 980 species on the updated list would bring a hefty fine of 100,000 yuan, or U.S. $15,500. “The new list will be instrumental in guiding future research funding, much of which comes from the government,” said Zhang Jinshuo, vice director of the National Zoological Museum of China. The writer Li You said, “it took more than three decades, but Chinese environmental groups and advocates have finally gotten their wish: an updated protected wildlife animals list with more than 500 new species on it.” China’s decision in early February to ban the trade and consumption of wild animals appears to be in part a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Scientists suspect that COVID-19 originally came from bats located in China. They are said to have passed it on to animals, which then passed it on to humans. If well implemented, the ban could also help to combat the illegal trafficking of wild animals. But some experts say that the new list doesn’t go far enough. Debbie Banks at the London-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) said that the updated list of protected animals is long overdue and brings greater protection to species that were previously overlooked. But she said that exemptions still exist under which species with the highest levels of protection can still be subject to commercial exploitation. The exemptions allow for the trade in animals that are captive-bred or bred for “heritage conservation or other special purposes.” This, she said, “perpetuates the desirability of these parts and products, stimulating demand, not reducing it....” Under the exemptions, skins of captive-bred tigers can be processed into luxury home décor, and medicines containing leopard bone parts and pangolin scales can be manufactured and sold on the domestic market. Based on seizures of illegal cargo originating in Africa and intended for Asian markets, pangolins are the most trafficked animals in the world The largest of these markets include China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam. Illegal pangolin imports have increased tenfold since 2014, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Criminal gangs are involved in seizing and selling pangolins. Kyle Oberman, an environmental photographer and writer based in Chengdu, China, detects a loophole in the new list because the protection of many species was only limited to those in the wild. Oberman wrote on the subject for the website SupChina. As both he and Debbie Banks explain, legal domestic breeding programs often rely on illegally caught animals. They can make a profit by meeting Chinese middle class demands for animal parts that purportedly provide health benefits, despite any medical evidence that this is the case. But China has come a long way since the days of Mao Zedong. As described by Oberman, in 1955, Mao began to encourage people to eradicate four “pests.” These four were flies, mosquitoes, rats, and sparrows, all believed to be harmful to people and agriculture. Mao’s edict led to millions of sparrows being slaughtered. Posters and even Chinese children’s songs and books propagated the slogan “eliminate sparrows.” Mao’s goal was to “conquer nature.” At the time, a scientist researching birds at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Zoology Research Institute suspected that eradicating sparrows was damaging agricultural production. Zheng Zhuoxin found that as a result of the loss of the sparrows, crops were being devastated by insects. After studying the contents of sparrows’ stomachs, Zheng found that the majority of the content of their stomachs was made up of insects. There was no evidence that they had been living off agricultural crops. According to Oberman, Zheng’s research led Mao in 1960 to terminate the sparrow elimination campaign. This in turn led to a greater appreciation among many Chinese not only of sparrows but also of other bird species. When it comes to wolves, it has taken longer for many to appreciate that wolves play a positive role in controlling and eliminating animals that threaten the ecosystem. According to the writer Li You, wolves’ adaptability helped them to spread through China. But the sheer size of their range and their tendency to prey on livestock brought them into constant conflict with a growing population. Li You says that wolves may now be the biggest winners from the new list of protected species, “a potential indication that China is rethinking its human-centric approach to conservation” According to   magazine in its latest edition published on Feb. 27, a Chinese best-selling novel titled  , which was released in 2004, marked a turning point in popular attitudes toward wolves. The book is a semi-autobiographical story of a student who goes to live among ethnic Mongolian herders during the Cultural Revolution. He becomes fascinated by the wolves that prey on their livestock. He laments the destruction of Inner Mongolia’s grasslands by farmers from China’s ethnic Han majority and their failure to recognize the positive role played by wolves in preserving the region’s ecology. “Wolf Warrior,” a patriotic action movie released in 2015, embodies a China that is respected and self-confident. Wolf Warrior Diplomacy has meanwhile become a term used by both admirers and critics to describe the tactics of combative and aggressive Chinese ambassadors. John Gruetzner, vice chairman of Intercedent Limited, a Canada-based, Asian-focused investment advisory firm, thinks there should be a global ban on cross-border trade in all wildlife. But he acknowledges that when it comes to China, problems can result from the difficulty of enforcing new rules and from poverty prevailing in rural areas where profits can be made from capturing wild animals and selling them. Making things more difficult, criminal gangs in Vietnam and Africa are also involved in wild animal trafficking. Interpol, the international police organization based in Lyon, France, could have done more for a number of years to crack down on the trafficking, but its budget and operations appeared not to focus sufficiently on the wildlife trade. But all of that has now changed. Interpol now appears to be fully focused on the issues involved. One of its mandates is to share information on the criminal gangs behind most of the wildlife trafficking. “The profile of the wildlife criminal has evolved,” Interpol’s website says. “Today they are organized, innovative, well-connected, and run global syndicates that commission the mass slaughter and capture of protected species in all parts of the world.” “The gangs import and export endangered species via the same routes that they use to smuggle weapons, drugs, and other illicit goods,” Interpol says. Interpol says that it has now shifted its investigations from low-level poachers and traders to identifying the key individuals and actors behind the trade. John Gruetzner, a Canada-based expert, suggests that to curb exports and imports of captured wildlife for sale, trained dogs should be put back in all Chinese airports. And, he says, Americans should be encouraged to end “trophy hunting” for wild animals in places such as Africa, adding that U.S. citizens are also a major buying source for exotic pets.

Critics say   courts often work in favour of the rich and powerful while delivering swift and harsh sentences on ordinary people for minor offences.  But it is virtually unheard of for judges to criticise the system. Kanakorn Pianchana, a judge at Yala court in the heart of the insurgency-battered Thai south, was delivering the verdict for five Muslim suspects in a gun murder case on Friday afternoon. He acquitted the group, delivered a courtroom plea for a cleaner justice system, before pulling out a handgun and shooting himself in the chest.  \"You need clear and credible evidence to punish someone. So if you're not sure, don't punish them,\" the judge said addressing the court and broadcasting his words on his phone on Facebook live. \"I'm not saying that the five defendants didn't commit the crimes, they might have done so... But the judicial process needs to be transparent and credible... punishing wrong people makes them scapegoats.\" The Facebook feed then cut, but witnesses said Kanakorn recited a legal oath in front of the former Thai king's portrait, before shooting himself in the chest. \"He is being treated by the doctors and is out of danger,\" Suriyan Hongvilai, the spokesman of the Office of the Judiciary, told AFP on Saturday. \"He shot himself because of 'personal stress'. But the cause behind the stress is not clear and will be investigated,\" he said. ''No Thai judge has ever breached protocol by making similar statements on the wider justice system'', he added. A lawyer working with the suspects said Judge Kanakorn had ruled the prosecutor's evidence was insufficient to convict.  \"Right now the five are still being detained and are waiting to see if the state prosecutor appeals their acquittal,\" Abdulloh Hayee-abu, of the Muslim Attorney Centre in Yala told AFP.  Over 7,000 people have died in 15 years of conflict in the Malay-Muslim majority southern region.  Thousands of suspects have been jailed for acts linked to the insurgency, many under emergency laws imposed on the restive region. Advocacy groups in the Thai south have long accused security forces of trumping up charges against Muslim suspects and using emergency laws to drive cases through the courts.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/05/112412-untitled-design-6.jpg?itok=Flr62O30\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162706", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21397", "source": "scrapy"},

The prime minister after consultations on Friday instructed the Ministry of Commerce and his economic team to immediately take steps to facilitate the relevant sectors, value added, apparel and sugar, by finding alternative cheap sources of import of the needed commodities, the Dawn newspaper quoted sources as saying.   Various proposals have been presented to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) which considers these suggestions from an economic and commercial point of view. After consideration by the ECC, its decisions are presented to the Cabinet for ratification and final approval, the report said. In the present case, a proposal was presented to the ECC to allow the import of cotton, cotton yarn and sugar from India keeping in view domestic requirements, it said. With regards to the ECC decision to allow import of sugar, cotton and cotton yarn from India, Khan held consultations with key members of his Cabinet on Friday and decided that Pakistan could not go ahead with any trade with India under the current circumstances, it said.   The ECC had decided on commercial grounds to recommend these imports for the Cabinet's consideration. While the decision was not on the formal agenda of the Cabinet meeting, the issue was brought up by Cabinet members and the prime minister instructed that the ECC's decision be deferred and immediately reviewed, the report said. The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Khan on Thursday rejected the proposal of the high-powered committee to import cotton from India, with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserting that there can be no normalisation of ties until New Delhi reverses its decision in 2019 to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.   Pakistan's U-turn on Thursday came a day after the ECC, under newly-appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, recommended importing cotton and sugar from India, lifting a nearly two-year-long ban on its import from the neighbouring country amidst tensions over the Kashmir issue. India has said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility, and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility. India has also told Pakistan that talks and terror cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.   The ECC's decision had raised hopes of a partial revival of Pakistan-India bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on the import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. India's move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162711", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17428", "source": "scrapy"},

For Hyderabad-based Sabista Khan, the name is synonymous with both dreams coming true and shoes. Her label ‘The Cinderella Story’ offers a wide variety of jutties not just to go with ethnic Indian clothes, but also quirky ones that go well with western outfits. Many Bollywood actresses, especially Kriti Sanon, Soha Ali Khan, Diana Penty, Manisha Koirala and Rhea Kapoor are quite often been seen sporting the brand. \r\nTalking about her initial days and how she entered the shoe business, Sabista says, “I had moved to Hyderabad from Mumbai in 2015 and was initially interested in designing clothes. But after doing some research I found that there are lots of fashion designers in Hyderabad. I next thought of bringing out belts and bags, before settling for shoes.” \r\nSabista says initially, they were curating and reselling footwear from across the country, bringing them under one label for various pop up exhibitions. “Soon we got a lot of requests for jutties. But we wanted to design our jutties instead of curating them. Reselling didn’t satisfy my creative urge; so then I started researching and travelling to learn about jutties,” she shares.   \r\nSabista was working in corporate communications and as a content writer till 2018, before diving into her business. “I ordered and studied about jutties to understand the issues. Fit was an issue, as some people have broad feet and jutties have a closed front. I wanted everyone to be comfortable wearing our jutties. Comfort first then style. So we treated the leather to not bite,” she explains. From February to April 2019, Sabista did a mock run and went live in April. “Lot of stylists took note of our work and included our footwear in celebrity styling and photo shoots. “Sobhita Dhulipala was the first celebrity to use one of my creations. It was for a teaser shoot of the Made in Heaven web series. I saw the teaser on my television, noticed the footwear and was completely ecstatic. The stylist had not shown me the shoot photos earlier. It was an amazing feeling,” reminiscences Sabista.   \r\nAll said and done, the two-year journey has been a roller coaster ride for Sabista.  The pandemic made 2020 a low period. “We were taking it slow post lockdown too, but social media helped us a lot in promoting our work,” she says. “There was immense personal growth; people took note of our work. It has been an amazing journey,” she adds. Sabista highlights the fact that technology helped her sail through the crisis. Sabista is now diversifying into sliders and mules, perfect for day-to-night look transitions. “The latest collection will have 13 pieces and will go live in May,” she announces.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162716", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16169", "source": "scrapy"},

Ordinarily, many millions of migrant workers make the long trek from China's production centers to their family homes in rural areas for the 40-day stretch around the Lunar New Year and Spring Festival, giving themselves and the country's factories a needed rest. Not this year. After weeks of indecision over sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks in several provinces in January, the authorities clamped down on migrant movements with a bewildering barrage of quarantine, isolation and testing rules for trans-provincial travel. The rules were published on Feb. 3, nine days before the Lunar New Year when migrant workers would normally be celebrating at home. While the requirements made many trips and family visits impossible, the authorities took pains to avoid the appearance of a sweeping second-wave lockdown, a year after the COVID-19 epidemic spread from Wuhan. \"Staying put is a recommendation rather than a mandate, with the final decision left to individuals,\" the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Feb. 10. \"However, it is a test of the government's effectiveness as it seeks to strike a delicate balance between ensuring overall safety and facilitating family reunions,\" it said. The commentary appealed to patriotism, self-sacrifice and the common good. \"By sacrificing the family reunions of some, the country is striving to protect the life, health and freedom of many more,\" Xinhua said. The campaign to curb travel appears to have worked on several levels, although verification may prove difficult. Over 77 percent of China's 280 million migrant workers were expected to forgo travel during the holidays, the South China Morning Post reported, citing a survey conducted by the Chinese Association of Labor Science, the Counselors' Office of the cabinet-level State Council and Xinhua. On Feb. 9, health authorities were able to report that the number of \"locally transmitted\" and confirmed COVID cases had dropped to zero for three days in a row. Officially recorded cases in the locally transmitted category have been minimal since then, while reports of \"imported\" cases have continued as before. In what may be another controversial outcome, China also claimed success on the economic front with a surge in consumer activity, thanks to the \"staycation\" that reportedly kept over 200 million workers away from their homes and close to their jobs. State media have promoted the feel-good story for the economy with data on traffic and travel. During the holiday week, the rails, roads and airlines carried 98.4 million passenger trips, down 34.8 percent from the comparable 2020 period and nearly 77 percent below that of 2019, the State Council said. But rail freight volume of nearly 73 million metric tons rose 23.7 percent in a sign of stronger economic recovery this year, Xinhua reported, citing China State Railway Group figures. Major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin saw surges in retail sales during the holiday period with some increases over 60 percent from the comparable period a year before. In Beijing, 100 major retailers, caterers and online platforms recorded 43-percent sales growth, the municipal commerce bureau said. The official English-language China Daily said that cinema box office receipts set a record of 7 billion yuan (U.S. $1 billion) during the new year holiday week. The Ministry of Commerce (MOC) also reported combined sales of \"key retail and catering enterprises\" from Feb. 11 through Feb. 17 climbed 28.7 percent from a year earlier to 821 billion yuan (U.S. $127 billion). In a further sign of recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, this year's take at the selected enterprises also topped 2019 sales from the same period by 4.9 percent, the MOC said. China Daily cited analysts as saying that the holiday shopping spree \"heralded a stronger year of consumer confidence and domestic market expansion in 2021,\" following a 3.9-percent slump in retail sales of consumer goods last year. So far, weak demand has been the missing link in China's official recovery narrative, although consumer spending accounted for 54.3 percent of China's gross domestic product last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). But there are reasons to doubt the conclusion that China's economy has been given a boost by the misfortunes of migrant workers who missed their once-a-year chance to visit their homes and families. While some were given incentives and shopping coupons as compensation, the Morning Post reported that workers were wary about spending after losing income last year. Some employers had shut down production rather than pay higher holiday wages, the paper said. Any gains from increased spending in production centers and cities seemed likely to be offset by reduced holiday spending in rural areas from the skipped visits this year. Year-to-year comparisons of travel data and sales growth during the Spring Holiday are unlikely to provide a valid measure of economic strength, since the spread of the epidemic last year prevented many migrants from returning to their jobs for weeks or months after their scheduled time off. The reports of improved sales have been distorted by both unprecedented population shifts and the historic downturn during the lockdown last year. In the first quarter of 2020, retail sales of consumer goods plunged 19 percent, according to MOC data. But China's official media appear to be intent on finding a positive economic outcome from the massive disruptions caused by the pandemic, said Derek Scissors, an Asia economist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \"This year, the cancellation of the Spring Festival is said to be positive for sales, demand and the economy. And next year, the return of the Spring Festival will be said to be positive for sales, demand and the economy,\" Scissors said. Even before the extraordinary dislocations affecting the migrant workforce for the second year in a row, the official statistics on retail sales and demand were seen as unreliable. \"Long before COVID, these results were all manipulated. They identify peak demand from the current year and deliberately do not compare it to peak demand from the previous year,\" said Scissors. Last year's weakness in sales, consumption and demand has cast doubt on the NBS estimate that China's gross domestic product rose 2.3 percent in 2020. Scissors suspects that GDP in the first quarter of 2020 fell even further than the record 6.8 percent that the NBS reported last year. \"Regardless, the first quarter of 2021 is going to show strong economic performance across the board, including consumption. The main question is will they compare to true first-quarter 2020 data or the fake data that they published,\" he said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162711", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12996", "source": "scrapy"},

On Feb. 26, China's minister of human resources and social security, Zhang Jinan, said the government had paid all of its old-age pensions \"on time and in full\" last year with increases for 120 million retirees despite concerns about deficits and contribution cuts, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Public concerns have been rising since a 2019 report by the ministry and the Chinese Academy for Social Sciences (CASS) warned that the pension fund for urban workers would start running deficits in 2028 and become insolvent by 2035, largely due to demographic trends. China's over-60 population is projected to rise from 254 million in 2019 to 300 million in 2025, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, while a declining number of younger workers will be paying into the social security funds. The forecasts have become a potential source of social instability because younger workers bear the financial burden of supporting the pension funds, as well as the risk that the funds will run out before they retire. On Feb. 26, President Xi Jinping cited the need to improve the social security system at a Politburo study session of the Communist Party Central Committee, Xinhua said. \"Social security is the most imminent and realistic issue the people care about,\" said Xi, raising expectations of major changes in the 2021-2025 period of the 14th Five-Year Plan. \"Although China has basically established a fully functional social security system ..., the country still needs to ... make practical improvements on the weak links of the system, as the principal contradiction in Chinese society has evolved,\" Xi said. In its outline of the five-year plan, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) promised to \"increase social security efforts.\" \"We will refine the national unified platform for social insurance public services, bring basic old-age insurance funds under national unified management, and develop a multi- tiered, multi-pillar old-age insurance system,\" the government's top planning agency said. Earlier this week, Bloomberg News reported that banking regulators are considering a plan that could form one of the pillars. The plan calls for creating a national pension company with state-owned banks and insurers as shareholders, Bloomberg said, but details have yet to be worked out. The pressures on pension funding from China's discredited one-child policy are expected to play out over the next decade. \"From now up till 2030, people aged above 55 will increase by 124 million ... (while) people aged below 35 will decline by 46 million as a result of population aging,\" said Robin Xing, Morgan Stanley chief China economist, in a report by China Global Television Network (CGTN). The retirement age for men is 60. Women in the blue-collar workforce retire at 50, or 55 for white-collar workers, Xinhua said. China's main pension fund has already been running an annual deficit of 730 billion yuan (U.S. $113 billion), according to the CGTN report. The strain on the system comes despite a government decision in 2017 to pump up reserves by ordering China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to transfer 10 percent of their shares to the national pension fund. In January, the Ministry of Finance said the transfers from the centrally-administered SOEs had been completed. The value of the shares in the 93 big companies was estimated at 1.68 trillion (U.S. 260 billion), the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) said. But the transfers may be little more than a paper shuffle. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, has described the assets as \"clearly not liquid\" and unlikely to generate cash to pay benefits. The government has added strains to the system by allowing enterprises to reduce their contributions to social security funds since 2019 as part of its plan to ease \"corporate burdens,\" boost profits and stimulate the economy. The plan predated the COVID-19 crisis, which dealt a further blow to social security contributions. As part of its campaign to rescue the economy by easing corporate costs, the government raised its tax and fee cuts from 2 trillion yuan (U.S. $308 billion) in 2019 to 2.6 trillion yuan (U.S. $400 billion) last year. Based on the numbers cited by Zhang at his press conference last month, the reduction in employers' social insurance contributions accounted for nearly 60 percent of the government's tax and fee cuts last year. Over half of the cuts came from reduced payments to old- age pension funds. The reported balance of 4.7 trillion yuan (U.S. $723 billion) in the pension fund appears to have fallen by 6 percent in less than two years. The condition of the fund could be considerably worse if the SOE shares have been overvalued. One implication of the share transfers is that the pension fund will be a major stakeholder in SOEs, but with no influence over their activities. \"The transfer does not change (the) state firms' management as the pension fund will be a long-term financial investor, only enjoying stock dividend and not interfering in operations,\" Du Tianjia, a SASAC research official, told CGTN. The government is working on plans to reduce underfunding, but all appear to face problems. One clear task is to unify the country's pension funds into a comprehensive national system by 2025 as announced by the Central Committee last year, the official English- language China Daily reported. Merging the funds from lower levels of government would allow financial support to flow from regions with younger populations to older ones that have relied on government bailouts, the paper said. Unification at the provincial level from funds run by cities and lower-level authorities has already been \"widely achieved,\" said Lu Quan, secretary-general of the China Association of Social Security. But the unification plan has been resisted by younger work forces in coastal regions with concerns about greater financial burdens and higher corporate contribution rates. \"They have become the biggest opposition force to a unified system,\" China Daily quoted Lu as saying. An even tougher solution may be to raise the retirement thresholds. The government has been laying the groundwork for the difficult decision, which has met with public outcries every time it comes up. At the social security press conference on Feb. 26, You Jun, vice-minister for human resources, said the government is working on a detailed plan to raise the retirement age limits \"in a gradual manner\" for the 14th Five-Year Plan period. You's comments echoed a government announcement of the gradual changes in November, citing targets for 2035, Reuters reported. Officials have argued to no avail that China's longstanding benchmarks are lower than those for other countries including South Korea and Japan, while average life expectancy in China has risen to 77.3 years as of 2019. The average lifespan is expected to increase by one year during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, Premier Li Keqiang said in his government work report. You said the plan to raise the retirement ages \"will both draw on international experiences and practices and fully consider China's own condition, traditions and history,\" Xinhua reported. The announcement of retirement changes in November drew complaints on social media, according to Reuters. \"Delaying retirement means we have to postpone our pension,\" one user wrote on Weibo. Another user said the decision \"has no rationality or necessity,\" Reuters reported. In an email message, Hufbauer said that solutions to the underfunding problems are bound to be difficult, noting that the social security system in the United States is also facing pressure. Last year, the Social Security Administration projected that its trust fund could be depleted by 2035, forcing it to reduce benefits unless remedial measures are taken. \"I think the ultimate solution for China, as for the U.S., will be to tap general funds. But in the meantime, there could be small fixes, like increasing the retirement age a little bit, raising taxes a little bit, etc.,\" said Hufbauer. \"Solutions will be painful, but I don't expect either China or the U.S. to cut pension benefits,\" he said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162717", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13467", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.dnaindia.com", "section": "advertise", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-centre-bans-exports-of-anti-viral-drug-remdesivir-till-covid19-situation-in-india-improves-2885866", "title": "COVID-19: Centre bans exports of anti-viral drug Remdesivir till situation in India improves", "author": null, "author_link": "/authors/sameer-dixit", "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "India's sudden spike in COVID-19 cases has led to an increase in the demand for Remdesivir injection.", "text": "The Centre on Sunday prohibited exports of injection Remdesivir and Remdesivir Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) till the Covid-19 situation in the country improves.

Considering the importance of the examination in admitting post-graduates in their respective subjects for further training, it is in the best interest of candidates to continue to hold this examination on the announced date. Therefore, it has been decided to add further protective measures for the candidates, towards the safe conduct of this examination.\" Candidates are advised to refrain from attending the examination if they are unwell and have COVID-like symptoms or are proven COVID-19 for their own well-being and for the safety of others.It will be mandatory for all candidates to adhere to these instructions as part of COVID Appropriate Behaviour. Same State Centre: In the wake of the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, NBE has increased the number of test centres and testing seats across the country such that candidates who had chosen the option “OTHERS” have been allotted test centres within the state of their correspondence address, thus avoiding any inter-state travel. COVID e-pass: Admit cards being issued to the candidates will bear a COVID e-pass for perusal of police & administrative authorities to facilitate the movement of the candidates in case of any travel-related restrictions. All state departments have been informed regarding the same. Staggered entry of candidates at test centres: To avoid crowding at the test venue entry, there will be staggered time slots for candidates to report. Candidates are required to respect the allotted time slots as communicated individually through emails and SMS. Isolation labs: All candidates will be checked at the entry point for recording of temperature using thermo guns. Candidates detected with above normal temperature or displaying any symptoms of COVID-19 infection will be allowed to take the examination in a separate isolation lab created for this purpose. Compulsory use of face mask: Candidates will not be permitted entry at test centres without an appropriate protective face mask. Candidates will not be allowed to carry any articles with them (such as water bottles, gloves etc) other than the admit card and entry-related documents required for verification purposes.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three children were among those killed after midnight Friday in the village of Bala in the jihadist-run Idlib region. \"A man, his wife, and their two little girls were among those killed,\" said the head of the Britain-based monitoring group, Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent at a hospital in the area saw the bodies of two of the children wrapped up in thick winter blankets. The strike created a massive crater of rubble near a two-storey home flanked by an empty outdoor swimming pool, the correspondent said. A rescue worker found a stuffed toy cockerel inside the building. Another first responder retrieved two slain rabbits.  The Observatory, which relies on sources inside Syria for its information, says it determines who carried out airstrikes according to flight patterns as well as aircraft and ammunition involved. The Idlib region has witnessed an uptick in violence this week, as the Syrian government presses a deadly offensive despite a ceasefire arranged by its Russian ally and rebel-backer Turkey. Home to three million people, the jihadist-run bastion is made up of a large part of the Idlib province, as well as slivers of the neighbouring Aleppo and Latakia provinces. Idlib is run by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group dominated by Syria's former Al-Qaeda affiliate. Fighting there since Wednesday has killed 28 civilians including eight children, according to the Observatory. It also took the lives of 58 pro-regime fighters and 67 fighters most of them jihadists, it added. Violence in recent weeks has prompted hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee their homes, exposing them to a harsh winter. On Thursday, Russia denied launching any combat operations in the region since the start of a ceasefire it said went into effect on January 9. According to Turkey, the truce started on Sunday. On Saturday, the Russian army deplored attacks led by HTS, describing them as \"deliberate acts\" designed to \"undermine the ceasefire\", according to Russian news agencies. Turkey's President   has said he would discuss the latest attacks in northwestern Syria on Sunday with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

The building belongs to the French government and is considered French territory, within the premises of which Marcon was filmed admonishing security personnel for trying to follow him into the Church. Officers were accused by Macron for violating rules that prevented them from entering the Crusader-era Church of Saint Anne. \"I don't like what you did in front of me. Go outside, please,\" he warned them in English.  \"Nobody has to provoke. Please respect the rules, they are [in place] for centuries. They will not change with me, I can tell you,\" Macron added during the dispute. A spokeswoman for the Elysée Palace told CNN that the President had intervened after an exchange between Israeli and French security. \"St. Anne belongs to France in Jerusalem. It is up to France to protect these places in this city. The Israeli security forces wanted to enter while security was being provided by French security services. The president reacted to an altercation between the Israeli and French security forces at the time of entering Saint Anne to end it, and to remind everyone of the rules that apply,\" the spokeswoman said.

US Vice President Mike Pence, Britain's Prince Charles, President Vladimir Putin and other dignitaries will be in attendance. Macron is one of many world leaders who are attending the fifth World Holocaust Forum in Jerusalem and dignitaries such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, US Vice President Mike Pence and British Royal Prince Charles are in attendance. Israeli officials state that the visit went according to plan, despite the \"discussion\" between French and Israeli security personnel. \"Based on the terms agreed upon ahead of time, an Israel Security Agency (ISA) guard and a policeman escorted the French president and his delegation inside,\" the joint police and ISA stated. An apology was also issued by the French President once the delegation had concluded its visit to the church, they added; though spokespersons travelling with Macron declined to confirm or deny that statement. Israeli sovereignty over the Old City is not recognized by France as it lies in the eastern part of Jerusalem which the European nation of France regards as occupied territory. Though most of the world shares that characterization, it is disputed by Israel, which considers all of Jerusalem to be its sovereign territory. Many have stated that the incident was reminiscent of one involving the late French President Jacques Chirac in 1996 when he was filmed in heated dialogue with Israeli security officials during a visit to the same Church.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/01/23/125518-untitled-design-39.jpg?itok=tAsglouS\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162717", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21974", "source": "scrapy"},

The structure will span the Brahmaputra River before the waterway leaves the Himalayas and flows into India, straddling the world's longest and deepest canyon at an altitude of more than 1,500m. The project in Tibet's Medog County is expected to dwarf the record-breaking Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in central China, and is billed as able to produce 300 billion kilowatts of electricity each year. It is mentioned in China's strategic 14th Five-Year Plan, unveiled in March at an annual rubber-stamp congress of the country's top lawmakers. But the plan was short on details, a timeframe or budget. The river, known as the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibetan, is also home to two other projects far upstream, while six others are in the pipeline or under construction. The \"super-dam\" however is in a league of its own. Last October, the Tibet local government signed a \"strategic cooperation agreement\" with PowerChina, a public construction company specialising in hydroelectric projects. A month later the head of PowerChina, Yan Zhiyong, partially unveiled the project to the Communist Youth League, the youth wing of China's ruling party. Enthusiastic about \"the world's richest region in terms of hydroelectric resources\", Yan explained that the dam would draw its power from the huge drop of the river at this particular section. Beijing may justify the massive project as an environmentally-friendly alternative to fossil fuels, but it risks provoking strong opposition from environmentalists in the same way as the Three Gorges Dam, built between 1994 and 2012. The Three Gorges created a reservoir and displaced 1.4 million inhabitants upstream. \"Building a dam the size of the super-dam is likely a really bad idea for many reasons,\" said Brian Eyler, energy, water and sustainability program director at the Stimson Center, a US think tank. Besides being known for seismic activity, the area also contains a unique biodiversity. The dam would block the migration of fish as well as sediment flow that enriches the soil during seasonal floods downstream, said Eyler. There are both ecological and political risks, noted Tempa Gyaltsen Zamlha, an environmental policy specialist at the Tibet Policy Institute, a think tank linked to the Tibetan government-in-exile based in Dharamshala, India. \"We have a very rich Tibetan cultural heritage in those areas, and any dam construction would cause ecological destruction, submergence of parts of that region,\" he told AFP. \"Many local residents would be forced to leave their ancestral homes,\" he said, adding that the project will encourage migration of Han Chinese workers that \"gradually becomes a permanent settlement\". New Delhi is also worried by the project. The Chinese Communist Party is effectively in a position to control the origins of much of South Asia's water supply, analysts say. \"Water wars are a key component of such warfare because they allow China to leverage its upstream Tibet-centred power over the most essential natural resource,\" wrote political scientist Brahma Chellaney last month in the Times of India. The risks of seismic activity would also make it a \"ticking water bomb\" for residents downstream, he warned. In reaction to the dam idea, the Indian government has floated the prospect of building another dam on the Brahmaputra to shore up its own water reserves. \"There is still much time to negotiate with China about the future of the super-dam and its impacts,\" said Eyler. \"A poor outcome would see India build a dam downstream.\"", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162717", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45624", "source": "scrapy"},

Analysts voiced disappointment with the economic and emissions targets for 2021 and the five-year period ending in 2025 after they were unveiled by Premier Li Keqiang in his work report to the National People's Congress on March 5. Energy experts and climate activists say the annual target-setting exercise has outlined less than ambitious and loose goals, leaving it unclear how President Xi Jinping will make good on his promise last September to reach peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Environmental advocates had expected to see signs of major policy changes affecting emissions in the 14th Five-Year Plan, which begins this year. Instead, the government appears to have pushed off the tough tasks of cutting coal use and accelerating efficiency until the future five-year period starting in 2026. The U.K.-based Sunday Times called the targets \"a great leap backwards on cutting emissions\" that leaves China free to keep burning more coal. \"Higher emissions in 2021 and the next years will lift up the bar for China to achieve an emissions peak before 2030, requiring more strict measures to be implemented later on,\" said Yan Qin, carbon analyst at Refinitiv Carbon, as quoted by Bloomberg News. The government's current plan calls for an 18-percent reduction in emissions per unit of gross domestic product, the same amount that was set for the previous five-year period. Per-unit energy use is targeted to improve by 13.5 percent, which is less than the 15-percent savings in the 13th Five-Year Plan. \"This is modest considering that China needs to speed up its action on climate to deliver carbon neutrality,\" Li Shuo, senior global policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia, told the South China Morning Post. The government has also cut itself plenty of slack in setting a loose goal of \"over 6 percent\" for economic growth this year, allowing it to claim success for its central planning policies while committing only to \"an appropriate range\" for growth in the 2021-2025 period. The leeway leaves the government free to maneuver over the annual efficiency performance and carbon emission ratios. An analysis by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES) cautioned that China had outperformed its previous targets for carbon intensity reductions and that tougher restrictions may yet emerge in sectoral plans. But it concluded that the plan \"seeks to balance ambition and political reality. And to an extent, it was short on ambition and big on political reality.\" \"Since the draft does not include a carbon emissions cap and continues to set energy intensity and carbon intensity targets per unit of GDP, with continued economic growth through 2025, carbon emissions will still rise every year,\" OIES said. China omitted a GDP target for last year, citing the uncertainty of the COVID-19 crisis. Economic growth fell to 2.3 percent from 6 percent in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The International Monetary Fund has projected recovery- driven growth of 8.1 percent this year, suggesting that the government will keep its commitments low. In its outline of the 14th Five-Year Plan, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) addressed the climate challenges only in general terms. \"We will make solid progress toward reaching peak carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality,\" said the top planning agency. The NDRC pledged to \"formulate a medium- and long-term energy development plan,\" without disclosing specifics of timing or content. The agency's major commitment on coal was to \"improve the distribution\" and \"ensure the supply.\" After the country's record production of over 1 billion metric tons of steel last year, it is unclear whether the government will impose any significant constraints on high- polluting industries in order to meet climate targets, if it means sacrificing economic growth. In November, Xi told the Communist Party's Central Committee that it was \"completely possible ... to double the total economic volume or per capita income by 2035,\" the official Xinhua news agency reported, raising the prospect of an economic growth race in the same time frame as the carbon emission goals. Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior principal fellow at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Energy Studies Institute, noted that the climate consequences are still subject to the NDRC's five-year energy plan and the sectoral plans for industries, which could be released later this year or in 2022. \"The pressure to keep GDP and employment growing may be in tension with the carbon neutrality goal unless the structure of the economy is radically transformed,\" Andrews-Speed said by email. \"It is possible that these tensions will be neatly resolved by the upcoming Five-Year Plans, ... but past practice suggests this will not be the case,\" Andrews-Speed said in an NUS webinar on Feb. 24. The calculations surrounding economic and energy targets and their effect on emissions illustrate the shortcomings of per-unit-of-GDP goals. While the proportional reductions allow the government to claim progress, the absolute volume of carbon emissions has continued to climb with GDP growth. Official data suggest that China's emissions have increased with government efforts to boost economic expansion, especially when restraints have been eased after five-year targets have been achieved. Last year, for example, China's energy efficiency index for 2020 improved by a minuscule 0.1 percent after five-year goals were met early. The government has set this year's target at 3 percent. Similarly, carbon intensity fell by just 0.8 percent last year as the five-year reduction topped the target with savings of 18.8 percent. But the backsliding on efficiency has effectively stalled efforts to reach the 2030 and 2060 climate goals. In a report for the U.K.-based climate group Carbon Brief, analyst Lauri Myllyvirta of the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air said that China's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions jumped more than 4 percent in the second half of 2020, overcoming a first-half decline of 3 percent and pushing the increase for the full year to 1.5 percent over the pre-pandemic pace of 2019. In December alone, China's CO2 emissions soared 7 percent from a year earlier, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said. At the heart of China's emission problem is the failure to curb coal consumption, which continues to rise in volume terms although its share of total energy use has declined. Last year, coal consumption rose 0.6 percent, the NBS reported without giving a tonnage figure. The China National Coal Association has estimated that consumption will be capped at 4.2 billion tons in the five-year period, allowing coal use to grow 6 percent by 2025. So far, China's energy plans leave room for the added volume of coal despite the goal of increasing the non-fossil share of energy to 20 percent under the 14th Five-Year Plan, up from 15.9 percent last year. The non-fossil category includes nuclear power as well as renewable sources like wind and solar. The government has signaled a new drive for nuclear projects with a reference in this year's work report, according to the Communist Party tabloid Global Times. \"While promoting the clean and efficient use of coal, we will make a major push to develop new energy sources, and take active and well-ordered steps to develop nuclear energy on the basis of ensuring its safe use,\" Li's report said. But the report made no mention of ending the construction of new coal-fired power plants, a hot-button issue for environmental groups and climate change. Last year, China added 38 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power, the equivalent of about one new plant per week, according to Myllyvirta and Carbon Brief, while 73 GW of new projects were announced. Advocates argue that the new capacity will lock in a role for coal in the years and decades to come, slowing reductions in carbon emissions. \"Clearly, there's no preparedness to put a stop to coal expansion,\" Myllyvirta told Climate Home News. The foot-dragging on carbon cuts in the current five-year period means that reductions will have to be accelerated even further in 2026-2030 to meet Xi's peak emissions goal. But by then, dozens of new coal plants will be operating with years of useful life remaining, making decommissioning more costly and politically difficult.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162717", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "14238", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.jagran.com", "section": "\n", "sub_section": ["/topics/kbc"], "article_url": "https://www.jagran.com/entertainment/tv-watch-kaun-banega-crorepati-12-nilesh-girkar-quit-game-on-50-lakh-question-related-to-football-do-you-know-the-answer-21296710.html", "title": null, "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "सोनी टीवी का मोस्ट फेमस और पसंदीदा शो ‘कौन बनेगा करोड़पति 12’ आज अपना आखिर सफर तय करेगा। 22 जनवरी यानी आज केबीसी का आखिरी एपिसोड टेलीकास्ट किया जाएगा। शो खत्म होने से पहले 21 जनवरी को दो कंटेस्टेंट अमिताभ बच्चन के सामने हॉट सीट पर बैठने में कामयाब रहे। गुरुवार को खेल की शुरुआत हुई निलेश गिरकर से, जो कि रोलओवर कंटेस्टेंट थे। निलेश अपना आधे से ज्यादा खेल बुधवार को खेलक 6 लाख 40 हज़ार रुपए जीत चुके थे। 22 जनवरी को उन्होंने 12 लाख 50 हज़ार के सवाल से अपने खेल की शुरुआत की और जीतते-जीतते 25 लाख जीत गए। निलेश के सामने 50 लाख का सवाल भी रखा गया था जिसका उत्तर उन्हें नहीं आता था इसलिए उन्होंने खेल को क्विट कर दिया। कंटेस्टेंट के सामने जो 50 लाख का सवाल रखा गया था वो फुटबॉल से जुड़ा था, जिसका जवाब निलेश तो नहीं दे पाए पर क्या आपको पता है जवाब? इस सवाल का सही जवाब था : अपनी पर्सनल लाइफ के बारे में निलेश ने बताया कि एक कोऑपरेटिव बैंक के स्कैम में उनकी लाइफ की पूरी सेविंग चली गई। इस वजह से उन्हें पैसों के बहुत नुकसान उठाना पड़ा। चार साल पहले उनकी शादी होने वाली थी, लेकिन इन्हीं कारणों के चलते चार साल से उनकी शादी भी रुकी हुई है। नीलेश के बताया कि बैंक से उन्हें पूरे पैसे वापस नहीं मिलेंगे क्योंकि बैंक के नियम के हिसाब से अगर कोई बैंक बंद हो जाता है तो सिर्फ 1 लाख रुपए ही वापस मिलेंगे चाहें कितने ही लाख रुपए क्यों न अटके हों। नीलेश अपने कम्पेनियन के रूप में अपनी मंगेतकर को ही साथ लाए थे। \n \n", "image_url": "<img id=\"jagran_image_id\" src=\"//www.jagranimages.com/images/newimg/22012021/22_01_2021-kbc12_nilesh_21296710.jpg\" alt=\"Photo Credit - Sony Tv Instagram Account Photo\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162717", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "80249", "source": "scrapy"},

The Duchess of Sussex has been advised by her physician not to travel. So the duke will be attending,\" a royal spokesman said at a press briefing, using Harry’s other title. Buckingham Palace announced on Friday (April 9) that Philip, the longtime husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died \"peacefully\" at Windsor Castle at the age of 99, just two months short of his 100th birthday.

He was the longest-serving British consort over his 73-year marriage to the queen.  Gun salutes were fired earlier on Saturday across the UK, in Gibraltar and at sea in memory of the duke, who was a senior figure in the navy before his marriage to Queen Elizabeth.  (With ANI inputs)", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162717", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34041", "source": "scrapy"},

The announcement came after the two countries' defence secretaries held a phone call to discuss the drills, the situation in the South China Sea and recent regional security developments. Unlike previous exercises, however, this year's Balikatan (\"shoulder-to-shoulder\") drills to test the readiness of their militaries to respond to threats such as natural disasters and militant extremist attacks, will be scaled down. Only 1,700 troops - 700 from the United States and 1,000 from the Philippines - will participate, unlike previous exercises which involved as many as 7,600 soldiers, said Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana. \"There will be physical contact but it is minimal,\" he said. The Philippines has protested against the   inside its 200 nautical mile (370km) exclusive economic zone at Whitsun Reef in the strategic waterway, repeatedly asking China to move the vessels away. Chinese diplomats, however, have said the fishing boats were just sheltering from rough seas and that no militia were aboard. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, China and Vietnam have competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. In the phone call on Sunday between Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Austin also reiterated the importance of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) between the two countries, according to a statement issued by Lorenzana's department. Lorenzana committed to discussing the matter with President Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte last year unilaterally cancelled the two-decade-old VFA in an angry response after an ally was denied a US visa. The agreement provides the legal framework under which US troops can operate on a rotational basis in the Philippines. The VFA withdrawal period, however, has been twice extended, creating what Philippine officials say is a window for better terms to be agreed. Relations between Washington and its former Asian colony have been complicated since 2016, when Duterte, who has criticised US foreign policy while befriending China, rose to power. Duterte has said Washington must pay more if it wants to maintain the VFA. Lorenzana also sought the assistance of Austin in speeding up the delivery of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by US pharmaceutical and biotechnology company Moderna that the Philippines has ordered. Austin \"would look into the issue and bring it to the attention of the office concerned\", the statement said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162717", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "44972", "source": "scrapy"},

Elizabeth Becker, who reported on the war in Cambodia in the early 1970s, has written a new book that sets the record straight. In her book titled  Becker focuses on two female war correspondents and a female photographer. I should state early on that I knew both of the war reporters as well as the author, whom I consider a friend. I only wish that I’d had a chance to meet the photographer, a French citizen named Catherine Leroy who loved nothing better than to be taking photos of U.S. Marines in the middle of a firefight. Frances FitzGerald, the second of the three, wrote for   and other magazines. She has written several books, most notably  , which deals with the Vietnamese and the Americans involved in the Vietnam War. While most American reporters were focused on covering the American military forces, FitzGerald focused on getting to know the Vietnamese from both sides. She arrived in Vietnam in February 1966. And then there was Kate Webb, who went on to become perhaps the most famous of the three after she arrived in Vietnam and began working for United Press International (UPI), which was my employer at the time. Some of the most powerful passages in Elizabeth Becker’s book deal with the challenges that Kate Webb faced in a male-dominated world as well as with her achievements. Kate arrived in Saigon in 1967 at age 23 on a one-way ticket from Australia, where she had resigned from a job as a junior copy editor. Kate went to UPI looking for a job. Bryce Miller, the UPI bureau chief at the time, asked “What the hell would I want a girl for?” Bryce’s attitude was typical of an era when women war reporters were rare. But he gave Kate some trial assignments and quickly came to respect her. When I first arrived in Vietnam in early 1966, UPI sent me out to cover combat operations, including stints with the 1  Cavalry Division and U.S. Marines operating in the northern part of South Vietnam. Then I got a huge break. Gene Risher, who had replaced Bryce Miller as the UPI bureau chief, encouraged me to do analytic pieces, or “think pieces,” as we called them. Partly because I could speak French, which was still useful then, Gene assigned me to cover Vietnamese politics as well as the non-military aspects of the war, including war victims, refugees, and the “pacification” program. I had been complaining that we weren’t covering the South Vietnamese aside from some of the biggest military clashes that they engaged in. Now thanks to Gene, I had a chance to cover the country, not just the war. It opened up a whole new world of uncovered stories. At one point, I took a break on my own dime to study Vietnamese with a Vietnamese tutor. After Kate Webb arrived in Saigon in 1967 her first job was to work as my assistant on the “political staff,” as she called it. But that staff was just the two of us with UPI in Saigon out of a total of 10 reporters and four or five photographers. Kate went on to cover all aspects of the war for six years for UPI, including a stint in Cambodia in 1971 when she was captured by the Viet Cong and held prisoner for 23 days.  While in captivity Kate developed a bad case of malaria before being released. During her ordeal in captivity, Kate was given up for dead.     published her obituary. At that point, Kate Webb became truly famous. What I remember most about Kate was her ability to get to know people wherever she went. As Kate described it in a book written by women war reporters, she tended to find her friends among the Vietnamese “from MPs, journalists, priests and students to soldiers, bar girls, and street kids.” In that book titled  , Kate said that in later years when her thoughts returned to Vietnam, it was often to Captain Truong of the South Vietnamese Army’s 1  Infantry Division. The division was often ranked as the Vietnamese Army’s best along with the marines and paratroopers. The captain’s soldiers were, unlike the American GIs, in it for the duration. His company operated at night without helicopter support. The men carried their wounded out on foot. In her book, Elizabeth Becker says that I sent Kate Webb out on high-danger night patrols. I don’t remember doing that. But I do remember Kate telling me about Capt. Truong and her desire to go on a patrol with him. I said okay, but you must pull back if you sense any danger. Kate was there on a patrol when Capt. Truong was wounded. When his number two man was hit, Kate helped to carry him on a stretcher back to headquarters, where his arm was amputated. I should add that I went out on a patrol with a U.S. Marine squad at the end of January 1966, which may have been one of the stupidest things that I ever did during the war. The Marines had lost their squad leader to a sniper on the same trail just the day before that. So I didn’t serve as a great role model for anyone. I was inspired by the stories in Elizabeth Becker’s book to recall that aside from Kate Webb several outstanding women reporters based in Saigon for United Press International also worked frequently in the field.   They took the same risks as their male counterparts. Betsy Halstead, one of the best of them, wore South Vietnamese soldiers’ combat fatigues when she went on operations with them. Bob Kaylor, a reporter who worked for UPI mostly in the northern part of South Vietnam, told me recently that Betsy was respected everywhere she went, Bob said that he’ll never forgot going to Saigon’s Tan Son Nhut airport once with Betsy when the two of them were getting on flights to go to different destinations in the field. Several American soldiers waiting for flights saw Betsy dressed in her fatigues. They asked Bob, “Who is she?” They were amazed when they learned that Betsy was heading into the field while her husband, the photographer Dirk Halstead, who was with her and wearing civilian clothes was staying behind. UPI’s Helen Gibson went through the South Vietnamese Army Airborne Division’s jump school at Tan Son Nhut and “got her wings,” as they used to say. Helen’s husband was assigned as a reporter in Vietnam in early 1968, and she joined him shortly thereafter. They left in early 1970 after serving in Vietnam for two years. I recently contacted Helen, who now lives in southern France, and asked her whether she felt that she got less recognition for her work in Vietnam than her male counterparts. “I think that women did fine,” she said. “If they did a good job, they were recognized for it. I can’t remember anyone saying otherwise.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"becker2.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/vietnam-war-women-03222021085657.html/becker2.jpg/@@images/c93b9b87-5038-4036-9675-fe71f02b4f5b.jpeg\" title=\"becker2.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162718", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "14010", "source": "scrapy"},

It is important to survive as financial issues are now more critical. There is a lot of hope on the vaccine and people believe that once they take the vaccine they will be safe.

How will they learn them online? It is not possible for us to teach these children. There has to be some method to bring them back to school and also keep them safe.\" Art, craft and sports are as good as passé for children in the 5 to 10 years age-group. These fringe segments find themselves at the receiving end of the disaster and their few numbers are not represented as they deal with the most vulnerable segment.   Dr Mothukuri Ramchander, a counselling psychologist, said, \"Stress of jobs, continuing family life and finding space in homes is a challenge for many.

Of these, 20 who had successfully completed all modules were selected to move on to Stage 3, based on the results of an online test and the votes received for their recipes. They were required to make a business pitch to a jury comprising top people from the food and hospitality industry. The best 10 contestants were given financial support of `5 Lakh to launch their business with brand development support from Maggi India. Shreya was a winner under the ‘Food Delivery Business’ category.   \r\nShreya says, “I was browsing through Instagram when I saw the advertisement about the competition in January, I immediately signed up with my recipe and food business model. After three weeks I got a call saying I was on the shortlist of 250.  For Stage 2, I had to create a recipe using their product and made it to the top 20  with my ‘Mexican Theplas’. For Stage 3, I had to prepare a 5-minute video business pitch for the jury in just two weeks.

But as my family is pure vegetarian, they were not happy about me cooking non-vegetarian food at the school. So I studied law, as my entire family is into the profession. It is like two sides of the same coin — law and food — I love both,” shares Shreya. \r\nShe says that though she has been a food blogger on Instagram, it was only when she saw her friends coming up with unique business ideas during the lockdown that she was inspired to start her home kitchen in July 2020. “My family has been very supportive, the entire joint family comes together to help me out — from packing to delivery,” says the advocate-chef.   \r\nShreya is planning to set up a double-decker food truck offering fixed menu breakfast and lunch by next year with her prize money and brand promotion support.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162717", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16058", "source": "scrapy"},

It would have acted as the counterweight to the Saudi-born fundamentalist Wahhabism. And it would have been, largely, an Indian contribution. This is the thesis of Ghazala Wahab’s timely book that is simultaneously a ready-reckoner for Islam as well as an appeal to moderate Muslims to reclaim their faith. Wahab’s urgent intervention pertains to the current moral crisis afflicting Muslims who number over 1.9 billion and form about 25 per cent of the globe. Written in crisp prose filtered through a lens of empathy and humour, her quest to examine Islam draws equally on scripture, memoir and reportage. She interviews the who’s who of Muslim India from politicians and bureaucrats to seminary heads and theologians. But she also has her ear to the ground, and is careful to catch every dilemma and strand of opinion of the common man and woman, be they a humble tradesman, the “new Muslim” or the successful professional, a dadi at Shaheen Bagh or a young student at the madrassa.   So far, the discourse on the Islamic question has been chiefly contained in the West, conducted as it has been by the likes of Susan Okin (“Feminism and Multiculturalism: Some Tensions”), Ayaan Hirsi Ali (maker of  , belonging to the alt-right camp), Irshad Manji (founder of the Muslim refusenik movement), Ameena Wadud and “ex-Muslim” Sarah Haider. Barring Hasan Suroor’s important 2019 work, however, this is the first book coming out of India capturing this discourse as it plays out in this country. The last fact makes it all the more accessible to the lay reader.   The reader, for instance, may be aware that much of the problems of the moderate Indian Muslim stems from their religious obligation to follow the Muslim orthodoxy, the ulema. But did they know that, as a phenomenon, the overarching influence of the mullahs is fairly recent? It began only after the collapse of the Mughal empire, before which the influence of the Sufis who were championed by the emperor was more widespread. The predominant view about Sufism is that it exists outside Islam as a cult born out of the admixture of Hinduism with the Prophet’s faith. But this is self-serving propaganda spread by two sources, the prejudiced West which failed to reconcile the sophistication of Sufi writings with what, in its view, was a “desert religion”, and the Islamic orthodoxy itself. The origin of Sufism much predated its presence in India. Hazrat Rabia of Basra died in AD 801.     Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (AD 1058-1111) was the first scholar to lend theological heft to Sufi mysticism, marrying it with Sharia. While Golden Age (Abbasid) philosophers like Averroes and Avicenna were among the first Muslim rationalists, it was Ghazali who arguably laid the foundation of Islamic heterodoxy. He said that as long as one believed in Allah and Muhammad, Islam could be practised in different ways. Nevertheless, this ruled out the philosophy of atheism. Neither of the Abrahamic religions is known to accommodate it. Until a generation ago, there were two kinds of Muslims in India, the Communists and the conformists, Wahab says. The conformists were the regular moderate Muslims. If sceptic, they were careful to hide their worldview from the ulema. For them, the personal was not political. The Communists, on the other hand, identified as agnostic. They were, at best, cultural Muslims. While they had been drawn to this ideology because it resonated with the Islamic ideals of equality and justice, since they did not identify as true-blue Musalman, within their community, their voices went unheard. Nor did they themselves find it important to address the dogma and bigotry from within by, say, reforming the clergy. Thus Wahab illustrates the failure of Left politics to address the fundamental reality of identity as well as the Islamic problem.   Now, if Wahab is critical of Hindutva and Saudi preponderance on the clergy, she is equally irked by the Congress governments’ minority politics. Citing Wajahat Habibullah’s 2016 article, she mentions M.J. Akbar’s role in the passage of the Rajiv Gandhi government’s infamous 1986 Muslim women’s bill. It was Akbar who had prevailed on Rajiv Gandhi to contest the Shah Bano judgment, saying that if he did not, it would appear that the Prime Minister did not regard the Muslim community as his own. Akbar was subsequently seen expanding this point in a Doordarshan debate against Arif Mohammad Khan.   The Hadith is contextual, writes the author, as is the Quran. The custodians of the faith need to move with the times in order to prevent the religion from atrophying. But what if one differs from the holy book in one’s analysis of context? Is it not bowing to stereotype to regard the status of women as subhuman in tribal Arabia before the arrival of the Prophet? If so, what of the example of Khadija, the Prophet’s first wife? Should have the Prophet’s wives and honest, thereby more capable, women, rather than the already less powerful slave women, been robbed of their agency to operate in the cause of good via physical encumbrance only so as to distinguish one group from the other? Is covering up also either a moral or an ultimately effective way to combat sexist aggression? There are no easy answers. These are some areas that the book does not go into.   Elsewhere, the author does write that the opportunity for freethinking is limited when exercised from within the Islamic faith. Liberal Islam may indeed be an oxymoron, by that token. All the same, it is interesting to note how key definitions from other faiths sit perfectly inside it. The author’s own liberal rationalism is the Buddhist way of the instinct- and deed-driven mahayana, while the orthodoxy’s essentialism would be the intellect-driven hinayana way. Quite startlingly, the Hindu dichotomy of   (dual and singular manifestations of God) also exists within Islam because the Naqshbandiyah order of Sufism rejects the Chishti and other silsila on the ground that the identification of the self with Allah is subjective and does not produce any objective manifestation, hence leading to idolatry.   The author’s caveat is that the moderate Muslim even today has no voice or traction within the larger Muslim society. They are caught between the Hindu right wing that regards them as exceptional and thus invisibilises them and the Muslim right wing which disparages them for their apologism. She exhorts these people to give up their conformism and take responsibility for their beliefs. Simultaneously, she notes a rise of Muslim exceptionalism and reverse identity politics among community members in reaction to Hindutva, as evidenced in the   sloganeering during the 2019 CAA protests.   “Young working professionals are overnight discovering headscarves. The more one points to the headscarf as a symbol of Islamic patriarchy or women’s oppression, the more professional women turn up in one to register their protest.” (p. 367) Such an assertion of identity leads to the closedness of the mind in a way that runs contrary to freedom and modernism, she surmises. Clearly, a gap exists between expressions of Muslim identity and its spirit of fearless large-heartedness. It is this gap that the book strives to fill. And in so doing it perhaps becomes the vehicle through which the writer bears her own shahadah to her Muslim heritage.   By Ghazala Wahab Aleph, Rs 999", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/1c2e1c94a6acfdf3c4868602b120840eaf249bef-tc-img-columnists.jpg\" class=\"mugShotHome\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162718", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "21670", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.wionews.com", "section": "WORLD", "sub_section": "Central Asia", "article_url": "https://www.wionews.com/world/car-bombing-kills-7-in-syrias-rebel-held-azaz-monitor-276730", "title": "Car bombing kills 7 in Syria's rebel-held Azaz: Monitor", "author": "AFP", "author_link": "", "published_date": "    Azaz \n    ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "The Britain-based monitor said the car bomb targeted a bustling area located near several restaurants, leading to severe material damage.", "text": "At least seven people were killed Sunday in a car bomb that hit a rebel-held city in northwestern Syria, a war monitor said.

The plan attaches nearly impossible conditions for granting the Palestinians their hoped-for state that sides with Israel on borders, the status of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements. \r\n  \r\nIt's being proclaimed as the deal of the century. Many Presidents before Donald Trump have tried and all of them have failed to bring peace between Israel and Palestine. \r\n  \r\nSo how is Donald Trump's deal different from the earlier ones. For starters, Israel supports the deal. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed gratitude to Trump and said this was an opportunity of the century. \r\n  \r\nNetanyahu's gratitude towards Trump is because the deal is stacked largely in Israel's favour. There will be a 4-year freeze on Israeli settlements which means a halt in the expansion of Israel's construction activities in the West Bank. \r\n  \r\nThe deal promises to double the area under the control of the Palestinian authorities. But a major portion of the West Bank settlements will be recognised under Israeli sovereignty. \r\n  \r\nTrump has vowed to grant statehood to Palestine if it demilitarises and stops funding terror groups. As expected the deal does advocate the 2-state solution. According to the President, an undivided Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel. \r\n  \r\nIn the same breath, Trump also said he would proudly open a US embassy in a Palestinian capital in eastern Jerusalem. It's still unclear as to how such an arrangement could work. The contentious Jordan valley has been recognised as part of Israel due to national security reasons. And on the economic front, Palestine has been promised $50 billion in investment with more than a million jobs to be created. \r\n  \r\nThe deal continues to draw on many aspects from the Oslo accords, including the region's map. The architect of the plan, Jared Kushner has said that the different parts of Palestine will be linked using tunnels, overbridges and huge highways. \r\n  \r\nBoth Kushner and Trump called this deal the last chance for peace in the region.The major stakeholder in the deal, Palestine have outrightly rejected the deal. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called it the slap of the century. \r\n  \r\nBut according to Jared Kushner, the Palestinians look like fools for rejecting the deal.

A senior doctor of a private hospital, on condition of anonymity, said, they had had 10 such patients. “In three of these cases, the patient’s lungs turned out to be fully white, which means they were filled with virus. This is worrisome,\" the doctor said. Similar cases are being reported from other hospitals too.   There is suspicion that this could be hospital-acquired Covid-19. This is because patients, especially in-patients, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 that is in the hospital for more than two hours, according to a study carried out by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB). While both government and private hospitals have separate pathways for Covid-19 patients, it is worrisome that other patients end up contracting the virus. A senior infection control specialist, who chose to remain anonymous, said, \"These cases are being noted despite our infection control protocols, as the virus movement in the hospital air is high. The other alternative could be that the number of asymptomatic carriers in the public is very high. Contacts of healthcare workers, patient caregivers and family members interact with society, leading to transmission and movement of virus. As immune-compromised are susceptible to virus, they are acquiring it.\"   Hospitals are finding it difficult to explain this challenge to patients who pick up the infection post surgery. Elective surgeries are finalised on various parameters, including when mere medication is no more effective. Patients have no option but opt for surgery. \"Separate pathways in hospitals require extensive care and extremely strong protocols, which healthcare workers have to follow. In the second Coronavirus wave, it is estimated that every fourth person is a carrier of virus. We are approaching a peak. During this time, it is better that patients put off their surgery in case it is not required urgently,\" a senior doctor said.   Similarly, senior citizens and other immune-compromised patients must not be called to hospitals for counselling for fear of them contracting virus in the air. They must be provided online consultation for some time to come. Dr Mustufa Afzal, senior infectious disease specialist at Care Hospitals, said, \"In the second wave, those with comorbid conditions are getting serious within 12 to 24 hours. The spike of virus within the body is immediate, and double mutant is a cause for concern.\" Dr Ashih Chauhan, senior general physician, said, \"Many patients are insisting on hospital admissions when it is not necessary. Trusting your family physician and opting for online consultation is the best way to protect oneself from variants of the virus. Patients panicking only aggravate their situation, as their basic parameters of blood pressures and sugars heighten in such circumstances.\"  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162718", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17079", "source": "scrapy"},

Finding her allegations “completely false, provocative and intemperate” statements, the EC said Ms Banerjee’s attacks and “attempts to berate and vilify the Central paramilitary forces during the electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation among the rank and file of these forces, who have been rendering yeoman’s service since the late 1980s in election after election….”   It also noted that the two-time CM “has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central paramilitary forces… Far more discouraging is the fact that Ms Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other. In fact, Ms Banerjee is sparing no efforts to ensure that a deep wedge and drift is created amongst them which is bound to have serious consequential damage even after the process of elections is over.”   Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in the city on Friday for the poll campaign, tore into the TMC chief over her all-out criticism of the Central forces and the accusations against him. Rejecting her claims, he observed that he had never heard of “a CM of a state or the head of a political party making attacking comments on the Central forces like Ms Banerjee.” Mr Shah urged the TMC chief to apply her “common sense”, reminding her of the “control” of the EC, instead of his ministry, on the Central forces during the polls. He also argued that Ms Banerjee has been “frustrated”, realising that she was facing defeat in the polls, which is reflected in her comments. “She should reply to the notice from the EC to her,” the Union home minister said.   The TMC chief, however, remained defiant despite the massive pressure that is mounting on her since this was the second notice in a gap of 24 hours to her from the EC over her violations of the MCC.  “I will keep talking against the CRPF and BSF as long as they are with the BJP. Otherwise, I will salute them. I respect and salute the jawans of our country. However, I would not do the same to those who are working on the instructions of Mr Shah.

The DA for the central government employees will be put on hold till June 2021. While announcing the decision, the Centre said that they will continue to announce DA on time but it won't get added to central government employee's salary till June 2021. However, the three installments of DAs - January to June 2020, July to December 2020 and January to June 2021 - will be restored and they will be added to CGS' salary and it will further increase the monthly PF contribution or PF balance in the long term. How? Monthly Provident Fund (PF) contribution is calculated on the basis of a central government's basic salary plus DA. The DA hike will lead to rise in one's monthly PF contribution. As per the AICPI (All India Consumer Price Index) latest data, a 4 percent DA hike for January to June 2021, 3 percent DA for January to June 2020, and 4 percent DA for July to December 2020 can be expected to get added in central government employees' existing DA, which is currently at 17 percent. If the DA is not delayed anymore, then it can go up to 28 percent from 17 percent. The rise in DA from 17 percent to 28 percent will further increase the PF contribution and it will also make changes in the employees' monthly salary as monthly PF contribution is decided on the basis of one's basic salary plus DA. The 52 lakh central government employees along with 58 lakh retired central government employees or pensioners will also get Dearness Relief (DR) benefit restoration as the Centre has frozen both DA and DR till June 2021.

This implies that kids remain active carriers of coronavirus even if their symptoms have subsided or even if they're simply asymptomatic. The study was published in Nature Medicine on March 13 and further reaffirmed the need to shut down schools globally in order to limit the contact of infected children with others. In the United States, local school districts have suspended all classroom activity. This has been replaced by the online model of schooling. According to this study, shutting down schools is in the best interests of the society for there's no clarity on whether children could pass the virus to others in the community. The study was led by Huimin Xia, of Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, in Guangzhou, China. All 745 subjects were babies and children. The age-range stood between two months to 15 years, and the children were selected based on their \"close contact with diagnosed [COVID-19] patients or were members of families with reported familial outbreaks\". \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nOut of the 745, only 10 tested positive for the virus and were admitted to a treatment facility, simply with the aim to protect others around them. It's imperative to note here that none of them showed any significant illness. Additionally, none of the ten kids showed any severe symptoms. Even in the seven cases that developed fever, nobody exhibited a temperature of over 29 degrees Celsius. \"There were some instances of coughing, sore throat and nasal congestion,\" the journal news release noted, but \"none of the other symptoms commonly seen in adult patients, such as muscle ache and headache.\"  Further tests like x-rays displayed no signs of pneumonia among the children. However, children with mild symptoms or no symptoms may still be able to transfer the virus to vulnerable adults. The worst part is that the kids may sustain the virus for way longer than expected, which makes them a harmful carrier group, especially towards the susceptible groups of populations.   This was ascertained by the researchers based on the swab results of the kids, which had come out negative. However, their stool still tested positive for the virus, suggesting that a minimal amount of virus might be able to sustain itself for longer inside children. A peculiar case involved a child's stool testing positive 13 days after they were discharged from the hospital. The kid had tested negative for throat/nose swabs twice. This brings into question the protocols in place for isolation. Most institutions suggest 14 days of the quarantine period.  \r\n \r\n\"Quarantine timings are currently assessed through the use of nose or throat swabs; however, these results suggest that gastrointestinal-tract testing may help to provide more accurate assessments of treatment effectiveness and recovery\", the news release said.   \"It's important to understand that viral shedding [in stool samples] seen in this small study does not equate with the transmission,\" Glatter said. \"While children may still shed virus in their stool, we don't know whether they may still be infectious and serve as a reservoir of ongoing transmission.\" Still, \"the report suggests that rectal swab testing may be a more sensitive indicator compared to nasal sampling regarding the effectiveness of treatment and when to end quarantine,\" Glatter added.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/17/133396-untitled-design-3.jpg?itok=PA8bJRPj\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162718", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22396", "source": "scrapy"},

Recalling the incident, Mika stated, \"My biggest weak point is my language, I am not someone who can speak fluent English but at an award function I tried to speak in English, and I messed up. What I wanted to say was 'I would love to work with  Sir', but I ended up saying 'Rahman Sir would love to work with me'. It was an awkward and embarrassing moment for me, but I guess Rahman Sir understood me, and hence, he gave me the song ' ' and together we created a chart-breaking version of an emotional song.\" Meanwhile, talking about his walkout from the stage, Rahman clarified to Bollywood Hungama, \"What happened is, we are doing a three language launch. Hindi is already launched and we are coming to Tamil Nadu. So there are certain kinds of protocol on the stage. We are talking to Tamil audiences who are already saying that Ehan Bhat is very fair. So I told her (the anchor) to speak in Tamil and follow the protocol.\" The Mozart of Madras added, \"I think she wanted to be kind to Ehan and he understands Hindi better and so she talked in Hindi. So I said, ‘Hindi?’ and I had to leave the stage. After that other people had to come on stage. So people put this one and one-two and that I got angry. It was a joke. It was not meant to be serious. I think it saved us a lot of money by becoming viral, spreading Ehan’s and my face.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162720", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "33540", "source": "scrapy"},

Their stupendous performance in last year’s IPL earned them a ticket to Team India. Their inclusion has once accentuated the significance of playing well in the IPL. But unfortunately, the competition was so intense that neither of them could find a place in the playing X1 in the ODI team. Krunal Pandya replaced Suryakumar Yadav for the ODIs; in fact, the latter made his ODI debut against England last Tuesday and scored a record 26-ball 50. \r\nSimilarly, despite some good performances, K.L. Rahul is facing stiff competition from Rishab Pant as a wicket-keeping batsman.   And with the next edition of IPL set to happen next month, more new faces are likely to emerge, putting existing performers in trouble. Ishan and Suryakumar were among the 12 batsmen who scored 350-plus runs in last year’s IPL. Naturally, they were drafted into the National side for the recent T-20 series against England. Cricket administrator and former Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) for Kolkata Knight Riders Makarand Waingankar agrees that IPL has helped many cricketers to play for Team India. He adds that the format has given the players a great opportunity to play against international cricketers much before they make their international debut.   “Youngsters have become fearless because of their IPL stints. The situation is so dynamic that it has become challenging for players to retain their spots in the team,” points out Makarand, and adds that sometimes even top performers have to be dropped because of the competition. “Team India won matches in Australia even without Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, etc. But now if they come back, where do you slot them?” he asks. While former greats like Sachin Tendulkar, M.S. Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, etc., had the luxury of playing the game almost till their 40s, the situation for the current crop looks grim. At a time where even performers are being left out due to high competition, cricketers’ longevity on the field is in jeopardy.   Sports analyst and historian Sunil Yashkalra describes the current situation as a ‘problem of plenty’. Commenting that league tournaments are the germination points of talent, he feels having a long stint like Dhoni, Sachin and Yuvraj could be difficult these days. “Today, longevity depends on not just skill but on temperament and fitness,” shares Sunil. He feels intense fitness will be the key differentiator for longevity in the game. “Vihari has done so well, but just one injury, and he is out of the team. And with the IPL taking place next month, the competition is even more intense, it makes things even tougher. Hence it is significant that a player stays injury-free,” he stresses.   Former Indian cricketer and former coach of the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, Lalchand Rajput, reminisces that during his tenure, fitness was never a parameter. During the ’80s there wasn’t much emphasis on fitness, but only skill, he explains, adding that today, a player first needs to be an athlete to make the cut. Observers feel that while Team India may not soon see the likes of Sachin, Sehwag and Dhoni who played for several years, the BCCI should follow a strict rotation policy, where a mandatory rest is given to players after taking part in a certain number of matches.   Former cricketer and Chief selector M.S.K. Prasad says that before he took charge, there were only 20 players playing all three formats (Test, ODI and T-20). He had visualized developing sustainable bench strength over a period of time to nurture the team to where it is now. “Bench strength (competition) will certainly challenge senior players’ longevity. With youngsters chipping in, it will also push seniors to perform better, so eventually, it will help Team India,” explains Prasad, who points out that Indian won the test series against Australia despite not having its seven main players.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162723", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17213", "source": "scrapy"},

The jawan of 210 CoBRA battalion who was abducted by Maoists after the April 3 Naxal ambush on security forces in Terram on Sukma-Bijapur border in Chhattisgarh’s south Bastar region was handed over to a four-member emissary team, constituted by the Chhattisgarh government to negotiate his release, at an undisclosed location.   The jawan, with his hands tied, was produced before a \"jan adalat\" or kangaroo court of Maoists in the presence of scores of armed rebels, local villagers and mediapersons before being set free at 4 pm.   “The jawan has been released by Maoists. He has reached Basaguda camp (of CRPF),” Bijapur district superintendent of police Kamal Lochan Kashyap said. He was scheduled to be flown to Raipur after his medical checkup, police said. “As soon as we learnt that the jawan was held hostage by Maoists, we contacted eminent people in the region, social activists and mediapersons to secure his release from Maoist custody,” Mr Kashyap said.   Earlier in the morning, the four-member interlocutor team headed by Padma Shri Dharam Pal Jain left for an undisclosed location in the forest on Sukma-Bijapur border to negotiate the release of the jawan with the Maoists. “I was contacted by the government to become an interlocutor to negotiate release of the jawan. I left for the appointed place in the morning along with other members of the team and some media persons to secure release of the jawan. I am happy that Naxals kept their promise to release the jawan if approached by government-appointed emissaries,” Mr Jain said. The other members of the emissary team were local tribal community leader Telam Boraiya, retired teacher Rudra Kere and sarpanch of Surkunda panchayat in Bijapur district, Rukmni Ekka.   With relief writ large on his face, the jawan after his release told reporters, “They (Naxals) treated me well when I was in their custody”. As soon as he was handed over to the emissaries Mr Manhas contacted his family members in Jammu through the cell phone of a journalist present and informed them that he had been set free and was coming home very soon, a journalist who accompanied the delegation told this newspaper from the spot. Sources disclosed to this newspaper that the jawan was spotted by local villagers after the April 3 encounter who handed him to the Maoists. “Maoists had grilled him to extract information on the strength of the security forces deployed in the region and the kinds of weapons they use,” sources said.   Maoist guerillas led by commander of PLGA’s battalion number one Madvi Hidma ambushed a search party of security personnel in Terram area on April 3 killing 22 jawans and injuring 31 others.", "image_url": "<img src=\"/images/logo.jpg\" alt=\"The Asian Age\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162723", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17026", "source": "scrapy"},

The prime minister after consultations on Friday instructed the Ministry of Commerce and his economic team to immediately take steps to facilitate the relevant sectors, value added, apparel and sugar, by finding alternative cheap sources of import of the needed commodities, the Dawn newspaper quoted sources as saying.   Various proposals have been presented to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) which considers these suggestions from an economic and commercial point of view. After consideration by the ECC, its decisions are presented to the Cabinet for ratification and final approval, the report said. In the present case, a proposal was presented to the ECC to allow the import of cotton, cotton yarn and sugar from India keeping in view domestic requirements, it said. With regards to the ECC decision to allow import of sugar, cotton and cotton yarn from India, Khan held consultations with key members of his Cabinet on Friday and decided that Pakistan could not go ahead with any trade with India under the current circumstances, it said.   The ECC had decided on commercial grounds to recommend these imports for the Cabinet's consideration. While the decision was not on the formal agenda of the Cabinet meeting, the issue was brought up by Cabinet members and the prime minister instructed that the ECC's decision be deferred and immediately reviewed, the report said. The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Khan on Thursday rejected the proposal of the high-powered committee to import cotton from India, with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserting that there can be no normalisation of ties until New Delhi reverses its decision in 2019 to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.   Pakistan's U-turn on Thursday came a day after the ECC, under newly-appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, recommended importing cotton and sugar from India, lifting a nearly two-year-long ban on its import from the neighbouring country amidst tensions over the Kashmir issue. India has said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility, and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility. India has also told Pakistan that talks and terror cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.   The ECC's decision had raised hopes of a partial revival of Pakistan-India bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on the import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. India's move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162723", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17428", "source": "scrapy"},

For Hyderabad-based Sabista Khan, the name is synonymous with both dreams coming true and shoes. Her label ‘The Cinderella Story’ offers a wide variety of jutties not just to go with ethnic Indian clothes, but also quirky ones that go well with western outfits. Many Bollywood actresses, especially Kriti Sanon, Soha Ali Khan, Diana Penty, Manisha Koirala and Rhea Kapoor are quite often been seen sporting the brand. \r\nTalking about her initial days and how she entered the shoe business, Sabista says, “I had moved to Hyderabad from Mumbai in 2015 and was initially interested in designing clothes. But after doing some research I found that there are lots of fashion designers in Hyderabad. I next thought of bringing out belts and bags, before settling for shoes.” \r\nSabista says initially, they were curating and reselling footwear from across the country, bringing them under one label for various pop up exhibitions. “Soon we got a lot of requests for jutties. But we wanted to design our jutties instead of curating them. Reselling didn’t satisfy my creative urge; so then I started researching and travelling to learn about jutties,” she shares.   \r\nSabista was working in corporate communications and as a content writer till 2018, before diving into her business. “I ordered and studied about jutties to understand the issues. Fit was an issue, as some people have broad feet and jutties have a closed front. I wanted everyone to be comfortable wearing our jutties. Comfort first then style. So we treated the leather to not bite,” she explains. From February to April 2019, Sabista did a mock run and went live in April. “Lot of stylists took note of our work and included our footwear in celebrity styling and photo shoots. “Sobhita Dhulipala was the first celebrity to use one of my creations. It was for a teaser shoot of the Made in Heaven web series. I saw the teaser on my television, noticed the footwear and was completely ecstatic. The stylist had not shown me the shoot photos earlier. It was an amazing feeling,” reminiscences Sabista.   \r\nAll said and done, the two-year journey has been a roller coaster ride for Sabista.  The pandemic made 2020 a low period. “We were taking it slow post lockdown too, but social media helped us a lot in promoting our work,” she says. “There was immense personal growth; people took note of our work. It has been an amazing journey,” she adds. Sabista highlights the fact that technology helped her sail through the crisis.

Eight of the 29 workers who were at the scene have been rescued from the mine, according to preliminary reports. Rescuers have located the miners, with 12 on one platform, eight on a second platform, and the last worker in an escape route where water had entered, broadcaster CCTV reported. \"The working platform with 12 people is 1,200m from ground level and the underground terrain is complex, making rescue difficult,\" CCTV said. Rescuers were also trying to pump water from the flooded shaft and have been piping air into the mine. Pumping equipment was being installed. Mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record and regulations are often weakly enforced. In January, 22 workers were trapped in a mine in east China's Shandong province after an explosion damaged the entrance, leaving workers  .

Authorities have to \"consider ways to solve the issue that efficacy rates of existing vaccines are not high\", Chinese media outlet The Paper reported, citing Gao Fu, the head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. His comments mark the first time a top Chinese expert has publicly alluded to the relatively low efficacy of the country's vaccines, as China forges ahead in its mass vaccination campaign and exports its jabs around the world. China has administered about 161 million doses since vaccinations began last year - most people will require two shots - and aims to fully inoculate 40 per cent of its 1.4 billion population by June. But many have been slow to sign up for jabs, with life largely back to normal within China's borders and domestic outbreaks under control. Gao has previously stressed the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is vaccination, and said in a recent state media interview that China aims to vaccinate 70 per cent to 80 per cent of its population between the end of this year and mid-2022. At the conference in Chengdu on Saturday (Apr 10), Gao added that an option to overcome the efficacy problem is to alternate the use of vaccine doses that tap different technologies. This is an option that health experts outside China are studying as well. Gao said experts should not ignore mRNA vaccines just because there are already several coronavirus jabs in the country, urging for further development, The Paper reported. Currently, none of China's jabs conditionally approved for the market are mRNA vaccines, but products that use the technology include those by US pharma giant Pfizer and German start-up BioNTech, as well as by Moderna. China has four conditionally approved vaccines, whose published efficacy rates remain behind rival jabs by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have 95 per cent and 94 per cent rates respectively. China's Sinovac previously said trials in Brazil showed about 50 per cent efficacy in preventing infection and 80 per cent efficacy in preventing cases requiring medical intervention. Sinopharm's vaccines have efficacy rates of 79.34 per cent and 72.51 per cent respectively, while the overall efficacy for CanSino's stands at 65.28 per cent after 28 days.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162718", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "44377", "source": "scrapy"},

Many of them are facing mental health problems and sleeplessness. With depleting income, their prospects are getting diminished. It is to escape this ordeal that they venture out.   Dr Preeti Swaroop, a senior psychiatrist, explained, “Fear of the virus exists but the bigger challenge is livelihood and survival. It is important to survive as financial issues are now more critical. There is a lot of hope on the vaccine and people believe that once they take the vaccine they will be safe. The government has to explain that in addition to vaccination, they all must also follow safety protocols, failing which they will be susceptible to the disease.\" The worst-hit sections are those whose jobs cannot be done from home.   A school teacher, on condition of anonymity, said “Children in pre-primary levels learn languages, improve listening skills and develop motor skills. How will they learn them online? It is not possible for us to teach these children. There has to be some method to bring them back to school and also keep them safe.\" Art, craft and sports are as good as passé for children in the 5 to 10 years age-group. These fringe segments find themselves at the receiving end of the disaster and their few numbers are not represented as they deal with the most vulnerable segment.   Dr Mothukuri Ramchander, a counselling psychologist, said, \"Stress of jobs, continuing family life and finding space in homes is a challenge for many. There is no scope for meeting friends, going out together or watching a movie. These challenges are leading to arguments, family feuds and inability to concentrate.

Her love of food made Hyderabad-based Shreya Mundra, an advocate by profession, stand out in an initiative by Maggi India to empower women from all across the country with the skills and knowledge to start their own food businesses. \r\nFrom 8000+ entries in Stage 1, 250 participants were selected and given a month-long training and mentorship by industry experts to launch a food business. Of these, 20 who had successfully completed all modules were selected to move on to Stage 3, based on the results of an online test and the votes received for their recipes. They were required to make a business pitch to a jury comprising top people from the food and hospitality industry. The best 10 contestants were given financial support of `5 Lakh to launch their business with brand development support from Maggi India. Shreya was a winner under the ‘Food Delivery Business’ category.   \r\nShreya says, “I was browsing through Instagram when I saw the advertisement about the competition in January, I immediately signed up with my recipe and food business model. After three weeks I got a call saying I was on the shortlist of 250.  For Stage 2, I had to create a recipe using their product and made it to the top 20  with my ‘Mexican Theplas’. For Stage 3, I had to prepare a 5-minute video business pitch for the jury in just two weeks. I am really happy to have been selected as one of the top 10.”   \r\nCooking has been a passion since childhood for this 26-year-old and she runs a home kitchen named ‘The Apron Tales’ with support from her mother and sister. “From childhood I loved cooking and I wanted to join a culinary school to make it my career.

It would have acted as the counterweight to the Saudi-born fundamentalist Wahhabism. And it would have been, largely, an Indian contribution. This is the thesis of Ghazala Wahab’s timely book that is simultaneously a ready-reckoner for Islam as well as an appeal to moderate Muslims to reclaim their faith. Wahab’s urgent intervention pertains to the current moral crisis afflicting Muslims who number over 1.9 billion and form about 25 per cent of the globe. Written in crisp prose filtered through a lens of empathy and humour, her quest to examine Islam draws equally on scripture, memoir and reportage. She interviews the who’s who of Muslim India from politicians and bureaucrats to seminary heads and theologians. But she also has her ear to the ground, and is careful to catch every dilemma and strand of opinion of the common man and woman, be they a humble tradesman, the “new Muslim” or the successful professional, a dadi at Shaheen Bagh or a young student at the madrassa.   So far, the discourse on the Islamic question has been chiefly contained in the West, conducted as it has been by the likes of Susan Okin (“Feminism and Multiculturalism: Some Tensions”), Ayaan Hirsi Ali (maker of  , belonging to the alt-right camp), Irshad Manji (founder of the Muslim refusenik movement), Ameena Wadud and “ex-Muslim” Sarah Haider. Barring Hasan Suroor’s important 2019 work, however, this is the first book coming out of India capturing this discourse as it plays out in this country. The last fact makes it all the more accessible to the lay reader.   The reader, for instance, may be aware that much of the problems of the moderate Indian Muslim stems from their religious obligation to follow the Muslim orthodoxy, the ulema. But did they know that, as a phenomenon, the overarching influence of the mullahs is fairly recent? It began only after the collapse of the Mughal empire, before which the influence of the Sufis who were championed by the emperor was more widespread. The predominant view about Sufism is that it exists outside Islam as a cult born out of the admixture of Hinduism with the Prophet’s faith. But this is self-serving propaganda spread by two sources, the prejudiced West which failed to reconcile the sophistication of Sufi writings with what, in its view, was a “desert religion”, and the Islamic orthodoxy itself. The origin of Sufism much predated its presence in India. Hazrat Rabia of Basra died in AD 801.     Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (AD 1058-1111) was the first scholar to lend theological heft to Sufi mysticism, marrying it with Sharia. While Golden Age (Abbasid) philosophers like Averroes and Avicenna were among the first Muslim rationalists, it was Ghazali who arguably laid the foundation of Islamic heterodoxy. He said that as long as one believed in Allah and Muhammad, Islam could be practised in different ways. Nevertheless, this ruled out the philosophy of atheism. Neither of the Abrahamic religions is known to accommodate it. Until a generation ago, there were two kinds of Muslims in India, the Communists and the conformists, Wahab says. The conformists were the regular moderate Muslims. If sceptic, they were careful to hide their worldview from the ulema. For them, the personal was not political. The Communists, on the other hand, identified as agnostic. They were, at best, cultural Muslims. While they had been drawn to this ideology because it resonated with the Islamic ideals of equality and justice, since they did not identify as true-blue Musalman, within their community, their voices went unheard. Nor did they themselves find it important to address the dogma and bigotry from within by, say, reforming the clergy. Thus Wahab illustrates the failure of Left politics to address the fundamental reality of identity as well as the Islamic problem.   Now, if Wahab is critical of Hindutva and Saudi preponderance on the clergy, she is equally irked by the Congress governments’ minority politics. Citing Wajahat Habibullah’s 2016 article, she mentions M.J. Akbar’s role in the passage of the Rajiv Gandhi government’s infamous 1986 Muslim women’s bill. It was Akbar who had prevailed on Rajiv Gandhi to contest the Shah Bano judgment, saying that if he did not, it would appear that the Prime Minister did not regard the Muslim community as his own. Akbar was subsequently seen expanding this point in a Doordarshan debate against Arif Mohammad Khan.   The Hadith is contextual, writes the author, as is the Quran. The custodians of the faith need to move with the times in order to prevent the religion from atrophying. But what if one differs from the holy book in one’s analysis of context? Is it not bowing to stereotype to regard the status of women as subhuman in tribal Arabia before the arrival of the Prophet? If so, what of the example of Khadija, the Prophet’s first wife? Should have the Prophet’s wives and honest, thereby more capable, women, rather than the already less powerful slave women, been robbed of their agency to operate in the cause of good via physical encumbrance only so as to distinguish one group from the other? Is covering up also either a moral or an ultimately effective way to combat sexist aggression? There are no easy answers. These are some areas that the book does not go into.   Elsewhere, the author does write that the opportunity for freethinking is limited when exercised from within the Islamic faith. Liberal Islam may indeed be an oxymoron, by that token. All the same, it is interesting to note how key definitions from other faiths sit perfectly inside it. The author’s own liberal rationalism is the Buddhist way of the instinct- and deed-driven mahayana, while the orthodoxy’s essentialism would be the intellect-driven hinayana way. Quite startlingly, the Hindu dichotomy of   (dual and singular manifestations of God) also exists within Islam because the Naqshbandiyah order of Sufism rejects the Chishti and other silsila on the ground that the identification of the self with Allah is subjective and does not produce any objective manifestation, hence leading to idolatry.   The author’s caveat is that the moderate Muslim even today has no voice or traction within the larger Muslim society. They are caught between the Hindu right wing that regards them as exceptional and thus invisibilises them and the Muslim right wing which disparages them for their apologism. She exhorts these people to give up their conformism and take responsibility for their beliefs. Simultaneously, she notes a rise of Muslim exceptionalism and reverse identity politics among community members in reaction to Hindutva, as evidenced in the   sloganeering during the 2019 CAA protests.   “Young working professionals are overnight discovering headscarves. The more one points to the headscarf as a symbol of Islamic patriarchy or women’s oppression, the more professional women turn up in one to register their protest.” (p. 367) Such an assertion of identity leads to the closedness of the mind in a way that runs contrary to freedom and modernism, she surmises. Clearly, a gap exists between expressions of Muslim identity and its spirit of fearless large-heartedness. It is this gap that the book strives to fill. And in so doing it perhaps becomes the vehicle through which the writer bears her own shahadah to her Muslim heritage.   By Ghazala Wahab Aleph, Rs 999", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/1c2e1c94a6acfdf3c4868602b120840eaf249bef-tc-img-columnists.jpg\" class=\"mugShotHome\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162727", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "21670", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.rfa.org", "section": "commentaries", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/ticks-03232021153402.html", "title": "Petulant Pyongyang Ticks Off Putrajaya", "author": null, "author_link": "", "published_date": "2021-03-23", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "The Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea announced last week through state media that it was severing diplomatic relations with Malaysia. The next day, Malaysia followed suit by giving North Korean diplomats and their dependents   to leave the Southeast Asian country.  At the center of the tiff with the DPRK was the fate of Mun Chol Myong, a North Korean businessman who Malaysia had arrested in May 2019, at the request of the United States, for allegedly evading U.N. sanctions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. Mun, who had lived in Malaysia since 2008, was charged with multiple counts of money laundering and attempted money laundering. After exhausting his   in the Malaysian courts earlier this month, Mun on March 17 was quietly deported to the United States, where he will become the   to stand trial after being extradited stateside. Through agreeing to send him to the U.S., Malaysia had committed an “unpardonable crime,” Pyongyang said. The North Koreans had demanded that the Malaysian government intercede in the courts to have Mun freed and returned to North Korea. They argued he was engaged in lawful trade and that the United States was bullying Malaysia into handing him over. It was a self-defeating move by North Korea, which has few friends. The communist state, which is led today by Kim Jong Un, has formal diplomatic ties with more than 160 countries but mostly on paper. Only 24 countries have embassies in Pyongyang, while North Korea has a few dozen diplomatic missions abroad. Beyond serving basic functions of diplomacy, Pyongyang’s embassies have an essential function of procuring hard currency, evading sanctions, and procuring technology and luxury goods for the regime, as well documented by reports. They are essential sources of funding – largely illicit – for the cash-strapped and constantly sanctioned government in Pyongyang. They have functioned as vehicles for the laundering of Pyongyang’s famed “super notes,” high-quality forgeries of U.S. $100 bills, as well as illegal narcotics. The embassy in Malaysia was no exception. It was long suspected for both illicit business activity and money laundering. The embassy assisted in the marketing of North Korean military communications equipment, among other activities. But most important, the embassy was tied to the procurement of communications and computer equipment for Pyongyang. Mun’s extradition to the U.S. was “very important” because the businessman was “part of Kim Jong Un’s illicit activities network,” as David Maxwell, an expert with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Radio Free Asia, a BenarNews sister entity. And, according to an indictment unsealed in a U.S. federal court on March 22, “Mun was affiliated with the DPRK’s primary intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, which is the subject of U.S. and U.N. sanctions.” Malaysia’s shuttering of the embassy was long overdue. In 2017, North Korean agents hired two women, Vietnamese and Indonesian nationals, to take part in assassinating  , the North Korean dictator’s half-brother, with VX, a nerve agent, at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Using an internationally banned weapons-grade nerve agent on foreign soil is an act of war. While several North Korean agents quickly slipped out of the country, the Malaysian government could not take more aggressive action against the embassy staff, including suspects in Kim’s murder, because Pyongyang was effectively holding Malaysian diplomats and their dependents there hostage. Ultimately, all nine North Korean suspects were able to leave Malaysia. Only the two women were ever arrested and tried, though in both cases the government eventually   against them. Though both countries withdrew their ambassadors,   were largely papered over. So why has Pyongyang escalated the situation today? The over-reaction to the extradition is telling. The best answer is that it demonstrates just how important money laundering is to the regime. Mun is an experienced operative with nearly 20 years of experience in money laundering, procuring luxury items, and technology that is essential to keeping the Kim family in power. On an individual level, should Mun negotiate a plea bargain with U.S. prosecutors, he could fill in important details in the American government’s understanding of how North Korea funds itself, procures high technology, and evades sanctions. But Mun’s extradition is emblematic of a larger concern for Pyongyang. North Korea is a criminal state, not just in terms of its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but the fact that it survives through crime. In the past few years, North Korean   have stolen some $670 million in currencies and virtual currencies, including $81 million from Bangladesh’s central bank. But no cyber fraud is too small. And the economy has been hard hit. In a speech last October, Kim Jong Un broke down in tears and acknowledged a significant economic slowdown, “grave challenges,” and “unprecedented disasters.” Which makes the evasion of sanctions and the import of luxury goods so important to Kim: it is how he buys loyalty to the regime.  The new administration in Washington will need to ratchet up sanctions if it hopes to force North Korea back to the negotiating table. Once formidable, with broad international support, international enforcement of the sanctions quickly ebbed after President Trump’s June 2018 summit with Kim in Singapore. After the collapse of the Hanoi summit in February 2019, the sanctions regime was never fully reinstated, with countries like Malaysia all too willing to continue low levels of trade and allow North Korea to conduct commercial activities. The United States and China, meanwhile, have a host of contentions issues, as was played out in last week’s testy bilateral meeting in Alaska. The rival superpowers desperately need to find issues upon which they can cooperate. North Korea, however, is not one of them. Beijing has too much to lose should Pyongyang collapse. Which means the United States under the Biden administration has no choice but to target North Korean operations in the 45 other countries where their diplomats are laundering money, peddling drugs, and skirting sanctions. Expect North Korea to retaliate in the way it knows how: through provocations. North Korea has tested nuclear weapons six times since 2006, including four during Kim Jung Un’s tenure. We are likely to see a resumption of   by North Korea, which were scaled back in 2020. North Korea has been a challenge for every U.S. president, and things are unlikely to change for the Biden administration in stepping up sanctions on Pyongyang. Countries like Malaysia, where North Koreans have operated with relative impunity, will be key to sanctions enforcement.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162723", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "14428", "source": "scrapy"},

After more than a decade of rising reliance on imported oil and gas, China's government has been reluctant to acknowledge the country's energy security risks. In a report to the National People's Congress (NPC) last May, the government's top planning agency pledged to \"ensure energy security\" for the first time. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) promised to \"improve our contingency plans in response to major changes in supply and demand at home and abroad.\" In its 2021 version of the plan delivered to the NPC on March 5, the NDRC upgraded the terms of its response incrementally. \"We will promote the development of energy transportation routes. strengthen our energy reserve capacity, and improve transportation services. We will refine energy contingency plans, improve our risk and emergency response capabilities, and strengthen energy security and resilience,\" the NDRC said. The agency promised to \"boost oil and gas exploration and development\" and \"systematically increase our ability to ensure the supply of coal.\" Behind the broad language is a growing concern over China's vulnerability and \"the need for higher oil and gas output as security risks rise along essential maritime trade routes,\" the South China Morning Post said. The paper cited stronger terms in the draft 14th Five-Year Plan for 2021-2025. \"The core demand for oil and gas should rely on self sufficiency. We should maintain the stable production of crude oil and natural gas and increase output,\" it said. But given China's domestic resources and difficult geology, self-sufficiency in oil and gas is likely to prove unattainable. Edward Chow, senior fellow for energy security and climate change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the new plan is unlikely to lessen China's over-dependence on foreign energy any more than the previous plan did. \"Unless there is a breakthrough in domestic production of oil and gas on the scale of the American shale revolution, domestic supply will not keep pace even with modest growth in demand,\" said Chow. While China's oil imports climbed 7.3 percent last year, domestic production edged up only 1.6 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported. China's dependence on foreign oil reached 50 percent for the first time in 2008. By last year, it had grown to over 73 percent. Domestic gas production did somewhat better last year as output rose 9.8 percent while imports increased 5.3 percent. But as China's demand for cleaner fuels has grown along with the economy over the past decade, its reliance on foreign gas has followed much the same path as oil, reaching over 42 percent last year. China's energy security concerns appear to be driven more by political tensions than import proportions. The geopolitical landscape has made energy security a \"more worrying and urgent problem,\" said Ma Jun, director of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing, as quoted by the Morning Post. \"Perhaps the government is more alarmed as it sees a more hostile external environment,\" Chow said. Two days of high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska did little to lessen bilateral tensions or Beijing's concerns. After the close of talks on March 19, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said that \"we certainly know and knew going in that there are a number of areas where we are fundamentally at odds, ... And it's no surprise that when we raised those issues clearly and directly, we got a defensive response.\" At his press conference on Thursday, President Joseph R. Biden was asked about U.S. relations with China and possible responses to trade conflicts and rights abuses. Biden said he had made clear to President Xi Jinping \"that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.\" The United States is consulting with allies on a range of differences with China, Biden said. \"And so we're going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable ... whether it relates to the South China Sea ... or their agreement made on Taiwan, or a whole range of other things,\" he said. \"China has an overall goal ... to become the leading country in the world,\" said Biden. \"That's not going to happen on my watch,\" he said. China's fears of international pressure could have troubling consequences for energy security and global warming as the country raises reliance on its most plentiful domestic energy resource by burning more coal. Coal consumption rose 0.6 percent last year to 4.04 billion metric tons, Reuters reported, even though coal's share of China's total energy supply fell to 56.8 percent. Coal production increased 0.9 percent last year after jumping 4.2 percent in 2019, according to NBS data. The China National Coal Association (CNCA) said the stage is set for another rise in consumption this year. \"Central government has said it will continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy, and meanwhile offer the necessary supports for economic recovery ... That would push up coal demand in 2021,\" CNCA said in a statement. The government has broken with past practice by omitting a five-year target for gross domestic product in its latest plan. It has also set no cap on energy consumption, leaving it free to steer economic recovery without constraints on energy use. The CNCA said that \"annual coal consumption will be kept to around 4.2 billion tons at the end of 2025,\" the official Xinhua News agency reported. Some reports interpreted the statement as forecasting consumption growth of 6 percent during the five-year plan period. \"But Beijing's push to secure coal, oil and natural gas supplies will be hard to square with its aggressive climate targets,\" the Morning Post said. In the days after the annual legislative sessions, Xi called for incorporating his 2030 target for peak carbon emissions and net-zero neutrality by 2060 into \"the overall layout of building an ecological civilization,\" Xinhua reported. Addressing a meeting of the Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs, Xi urged \"perseverance in achieving the goals,\" Xinhua said. One day later, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced a series of measures to improve energy efficiency and upgrade the industrial sector with new electrical equipment. But it remains unclear how the calls for reform will be reconciled with the projections of higher energy use and coal consumption over the next five years. On balance, China's plans have set a course for increases in carbon emissions when it should be cutting. \"Without the energy consumption control target, there's even less in this five-year plan to constrain emissions growth than in the previous ones,\" wrote lead analyst Lauri Myllyvirta in a posting at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air. \"As a result, there's no guarantee that emissions growth will slow down, let alone stop, by 2025,\" said Myllyvirta. \"Overall, the picture is one of very gradual progress in aligning China's energy and emissions trends with the target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060,\" he said. In the six months since Xi's announcement of climate goals, China has yet to clear a path toward achieving them. Instead, the new five-year plan and its heightened concern with energy security has highlighted opposing forces at work. \"The long-term solution does not lie in subsidizing uneconomic domestic oil and gas production or prolonging the use of polluting domestic coal, but by investing in energy transition away from fossil fuels,\" Chow said. \"The scale of Chinese efforts in this regard is impressive. However, this will take time to achieve meaningful results, just as it does for the rest of the world,\" said Chow. \"In the short to medium term, China's energy import vulnerability will remain a major concern for its government,\" he said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162727", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13441", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.wionews.com", "section": "WORLD", "sub_section": "Central Asia", "article_url": "https://www.wionews.com/world/home-quarantine-no-option-for-thousands-in-philippines-288048", "title": "Home quarantine no option for thousands in Philippines", "author": "Reuters", "author_link": "", "published_date": "    Manila\n    ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Tents have since last week been set up at one shelter in a Manila gymnasium", "text": "While millions in the Philippines are finding tight restrictions a little difficult, home quarantine would be luxury for the thousands of urban street dwellers who have no homes to go to.

Workers have been instructed to return to factories, businesses are attempting to reboot, and most travel bans have been lifted. Even though China claims that Wuhan has returned to normal, the country has kept mum about what happened in the city during the two-month long lockdown. Multiple reports and videos clearly showed Chinese authorities dragging citizens out of their homes for testing and containment. Additionally, there has been no acknowledgment of the intense control exercised by China over what information is shared with the world.

Zeng is a prominent Chinese activist who has ardently recorded Beijing’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. With a state-initiated crackdown on independent reporting, China wants to display to the world their medical prowess. Just last week, China expelled American reporters based in the country.

Taking a giant step for diversity, the Biden-Harris Administration seeks to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. On Friday the administration submitted US President Joe Biden's priorities for 2022 discretionary spending to Congress. \"This goal aligns with President Biden's commitment to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all,\" said acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk.  While the first cadre of astronauts for the Artemis program was announced in December, the first two crew members for Artemis III in 2024 have yet to be announced. The initial group of 18 represents a diverse team of astronauts, including those new to NASA and veterans of spaceflight. The Artemis astronauts also include Indian American Raja Chari. \"These are historic moments in advancing equity for all of mankind,\" said Bhavya Lal, acting NASA chief of staff. She added that the announcement is personally \"very meaningful\" to her. Lal came to the US at 18 years old, carrying two suitcases full of books and never imagining she would work at NASA in the future. \"If you can see it, you can believe it,\" she said in a tweet. Returning astronauts to the moon will act as a proving ground before sending them on to Mars, a long-term goal of the Artemis program.  When astronauts explore the lunar south pole, which has never been visited by humans before, they will build on the legacy and science gained during the Apollo program and carry it into a new century.In a statement released by , the proposed spending also calls for an increase of more than 6 percent than the previous year.  \"This USD 24.7 billion funding request demonstrates the Biden Administration's commitment to NASA and its partners who have worked so hard this past year under difficult circumstances and achieved unprecedented success,\" Jurczyk said.  \"The President's discretionary request Strengthens NASA's ability to better understand Earth and how it works as an integrated system, from our oceans to our atmosphere, how it all impacts our daily lives, and how it all is impacted by climate change,\" he added. In addition to aiding the Artemis program and studying climate change, the President's request would also help further the agency's robotic exploration of space, provide a boost to aviation technology and provide new funding for NASA's efforts to engage in STEM outreach for underserved students, according to the agency. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162727", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "33743", "source": "scrapy"},

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162724", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45260", "source": "scrapy"},

By stating he would no longer be head of the fourth-generation (4G) team of leaders in Government, Mr Heng has thrown the question of who will succeed PM Lee wide open yet again. Mr Heng, a career civil servant until he contested in the 2011 General Election (GE), had been chosen as the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) First Assistant Secretary-General in November 2018. In April 2019, he was appointed Singapore’s sole DPM, signifying that there had been a consensus among the 4G team that Mr Heng should lead them and the country. With these developments, Mr Heng, was in all senses, the PM-designate. He was even handed the task of Acting PM in the absence of PM Lee. When he brought his East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) to a slim victory after an 11th hour switch from his stronghold in Tampines GRC in GE2020, some were generous to say that he successfully held off a rout by the Workers’ Party. A second camp argued he had been wounded by his performance and wondered if the party might review his suitability as the nation’s next leader. They might think their instinct was right when Mr Heng said he was stepping aside for a new leader but he has also debunked this perceived link: “The results in the GE2020 performance, in particular, in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside,” he said at the media conference on Thursday. In response to DPM Heng’s announcement, the 4G leaders said in a statement on Thursday “this unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning”. Given that PM Lee also said he would be announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks’ time, the question arises: Why was it not possible to pair the announcements to give the assurance to citizens that there would be, nonetheless, forward momentum in the process of leadership renewal? Since PM Lee said there would be consequential shifts, would those whose political stocks rise – a second DPM, a new Minister for Finance or even a new Defence Minister, for instance, give indication of who the PAP might test as a replacement for Mr Heng. But whose choice would that be? While the two-week interregnum may cause the rumour mills to go into overdrive, can the matter of who the 4G leaders wish to select be settled quite so quickly? Should it? Having said that, if current Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is also Second Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP, were to be placed in the powerful Finance Minister role, it could be taken as a forgone conclusion that Mr Chan is next in line to succeed PM Lee. This would be the fastest way to resolve the succession question. Like Mr Heng, Mr Chan entered Government with the 2011 GE. He has held a few full ministerial portfolios but most unusually, has had a tour of duty outside of mainstream government as the country’s labour chief - Secretary-General at the National Trades Union Congress. He has also been developing his international exposure through a collaborative project between the Government and that of Chongqing province in the People’s Republic of China. His previous incarnation as a Major-General and Chief of Army in the Singapore Armed Forces will have afforded him defence networks in the region and also in the United States where he was the first foreign graduate to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award by the prestigious Army Command and General Staff College. In his current portfolio as Industry and Trade Minister during the pandemic, Minister Chan has worked overtime to secure multilateral trade arrangements and ensure that international trade lines remain open. However, at Thursday’s press conference on Mr Heng’s announcement, Mr Chan and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung - another 4G member touted to be a contender for the premiership - said that the 4G team will need time to consider afresh and “holistically” who might be most suited to be the “captain of the team” using Ong’s preferred metaphor.  In other words, the most obvious choice may not be the answer. What is at stake here? The deleterious public health and economic effects of COVID-19, Mr Heng, explained, would require several years to recede.  PM Lee has also previously acknowledged this while assuring Singaporeans that he will see Singapore through the current crisis and is “determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team”. If he only took over as premier then, Mr Heng would already be in his mid-60s. Sixty-five, we know, is the age when Singapore’s first PM Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to stand down and also two years older than when its second PM, Goh Chok Tong, transferred premiership to the current PM.  This would not have given Mr Heng a long enough runway to govern before the handover to the next leader is expected. This cycle of leadership succession would have started again all too soon. Precious time has been lost to the pandemic since the PM-in-waiting was also limited in his ability to travel overseas to strengthen his standing in the international community. From the disruptions that emanate from US-China relations and the domestic political instability within some of our Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncertainty about how ASEAN can continue to provide ballast for peace, stability and security in the region, which Singapore relies on, is something PM Lee’s successor must be prepared to address.  This person must have a certain level of exposure and experience in operating on that plane. In that regard, the two former Principal Private Secretaries to the current PM, Mr Ong and Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who are on the other hand 51 and 48 years old respectively, may also have some help to draw upon.  They can ride on the networks they have built from that role as well as the tutelage of the current PM - much like Mr Heng could, given that he played the same role to Singapore’s first PM. The advantage might go to Mr Wong, who has built a high and favourable public profile as co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 and clearly has the confidence of DPM Heng, serving as the latter’s Second Minister of Finance since August 2016. If on the other hand, the 4G privileges a leader’s standing domestically and more importantly, his or her ability to motivate to inspire peers and citizens, the people-oriented Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at 44 years of age may be given more time to prove himself. Ironically, this process of readying these individuals and testing the dynamics among the 4G leaders without Mr Heng in the picture will indeed take time. The next PAP Conference and GE may even be needed as barometers of support among cadres and citizens. With PM Lee to provide the firm and steady leadership through the severe and immediate COVID-19 challenge, the best way forward is to take a step back to watch how these candidates continue to interact with Singaporeans, their international counterparts and each other before a new successor is announced.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/10586236/bf96a54634b0637b0f830fbf41a3019f/gillian-koh-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Koh\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48791", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.dnaindia.com", "section": "entertainment", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-pfizer-biontech-seek-covid19-vaccine-authorisation-for-12-to-15-year-olds-in-united-states-2885641", "title": "US: Pfizer, BioNTech seek vaccine authorisation for 12 to 15-year olds", "author": null, "author_link": "/authors/dna-web-team", "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Pfizer and BioNTech cited research unveiled last month that found its vaccine is 100 percent effective in children ages 12 to 15.", "text": "Pfizer and BioNTech requested the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday for an amendment to its emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine, to expand its use for children ages 12 to 15 in the United States.

Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47703", "source": "scrapy"},

However, it coincides with one of the biggest pandemics our societies have witnessed: the novel coronavirus COVID-19. As of figures from today, more than 380,000 cases have been registered worldwide. Additionally, over 16,500 have died. The global tally of the recovered patients so far stands at 100,000. Will the rise in temperatures across the globe mean a dip in the number of infected cases? Many Chinese experts claim that high temperature and humidity can significantly reduce the transmission of the virus. The research was undertaken at Beihang and Tsinghua University in China.   The focus of the study was 100 Chinese cities. The scientists realised that the transmission rate varied across cities with different weather conditions. They realised that as the weather became warmer and humid, the rate of transmission fell. For every degree of rise in temperatures (in Celsius), the rate of transmission fell by 0.0383 points. Similarly, for every one per cent increase in relative humidity, the transmission rate fell by 0.0224 points. Even though an important development, the rise in temperature is simply not enough to slow down the spread of the virus. As it turns out, heat weakens all kinds of viruses. The COVID-19 is capable of living on surfaces for many days.  During its initial period, countries that experience lower temperatures and humidity witnessed severe outbreaks. These include South Korea, Japan, and Iran. On the other hand, warmer countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand were able to contain it much quickly. Another study conducted at the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland took a different approach. The researchers mapped the outbreak in different regions and discovered that the most severe outbreaks happened in countries where the temperature ranged between five and 11 degree Celsius. The virus was found to be clustered in a narrow band of consistently similar weather conditions across the northern hemisphere. This zone included countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, Iran , Italy, France and the US Pacific Northwest. The study has also indicated that the coronavirus could be a seasonal respiratory virus. Both studies point out to the same verdict: the forthcoming summers could bring relief, but would it completely stop the virus? The answer remains no! Many doctors have warned of the virus resurfacing during autumn, and reiterate the importance of maintaining personal hygiene and practicing social distancing.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/02/12/128544-untitled-design-15.jpg?itok=ezHHXif8\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21824", "source": "scrapy"},

The reason behind this all: the coronavirus pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China. Many researchers and analysts have reiterated that China has displayed grave negligence in handling the virus. Recently, a faction within the Chinese Communist Party has displayed dissatisfaction over Xi Jinping’s response of the virus.   Based on a message circulated on the popular Chinese platform “WeChat”, the bloc was ready for a revolt! The open letter in question calls for a meeting of the politburo to assess Jinping’s performance. The politburo comprises 25 individuals that run the Communist Party. This faction against the Chinese president wants to reflect on \"Xi's wrongs\", and evaluate whether he should carry on as the leader of China. However, challenging his authority is not that simple, for besides being the President of China, he serves as the Chief of the Communist Party. He additionally enjoys support among the political elite in China. The man, who is referred to as the most powerful leader of China since Mao is facing backlash from within his party. Over the last few weeks, China has worked hard to retain its image both globally and at home. Earlier this month, Wuhan’s top party official came up with the idea of a “gratitude education programme”, centred around thanking Xi Jinping and The Communist Party for the efforts they have made to fight the coronavirus. “We must through various channels carry out gratitude education among the citizens of the whole city as well as cadres”, the official had told a local newspaper. The rationale behind this was to extend gratitude to Jinping and to the Communist Party. However, the public reaction to the idea was not very nice. People immediately slammed the idea of this programme, with a local journalist asking the party official to first “educate himself”. To avoid collateral damage, the Chinese authorities covered up the criticism and dropped the idea of the programme itself.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2018/09/11/15469-gettyimages-493919954-20161214052142.jpg?itok=18flu-N7\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21696", "source": "scrapy"},

In today’s post-COVID-19 world, the visitor figures are about 60 per cent of monthly capacity. Some things have not changed, however; for instance, a number of people think it is acceptable not to shower before entering the pool, the programme   finds out in a series of vox pops. Others may even pee in the pool, thinking that chlorine is used to disinfect the water. The problem, however, is that urine and sweat contain ammonia, which reduces the effect that chlorine has on the water. So what is being done to keep the pools sufficiently clean to protect swimmers from bacteria and viruses, which can enter the water? And what is the principal reason why one should shower before swimming? Marchwood Laboratory Services technical manager Tan Thuan Piang, who has sampled Singapore’s pool waters with his team for over 15 years, noted that ammonia in pools, though mainly from sweat and urine, also comes from sunscreen lotion and cosmetics. While the amount of ammonia in Singapore’s pools is usually “minute” — low enough to escape detection — a possible reason for this is that ammonia “reacts very fast” with chlorine in the water to form the by-product chloramine, he said. When there is a “heavy chlorine smell”, it is usually tri-chloramine, a type of chloramine formed as the ammonia level rises and “not the chlorine we really want”, cited Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute executive director Shane Snyder. “It’s a nuisance,” said the professor, who has studied water quality and safety for more than 20 years. “As the chlorine forms chloramine, there’s less chlorine there. So we have to … add more chlorine to keep the level safe. “If we don’t practise good hygiene, the amount of chlorine in a swimming pool will drop quickly and make it less safe … The more hygiene we have, the less ammonia there’ll be and the cleaner the pools stay.” This is why he “always” advocates showering before entering the pool — to minimise the amount of chemicals it needs. Chloramine can also have a more direct effect on swimmers. National Skin Centre consultant dermatologist Lucinda Tan, who handles two to three patients a month for swimming-related conditions, said chloramines can “irritate and dry the skin” by stripping away the skin’s natural protective oil. “This allows dust, bacteria (and) allergens to enter and cause irritation. A normal person with normal skin … may get away with that,” she said. “You break a lot of the skin barrier, and you allow a lot of germs to enter, and then you can get bad infections,\" she added. “If your immune system is compromised … and (you have) a small cut and whatnot, you can still pick up an infection that can potentially worsen with time.” She noted that all exposed parts of the body, including the hair and eyes, can be affected. People may also end up with a dry and itchy throat if they swallow “a little bit more” pool water. And some children may be more susceptible to dry, irritating skin than adults. To maintain safety, there are national standards for the chlorine level in Singapore’s swimming pools: It must be between one to three parts per million. “Too little chlorine (and) it’d encourage algae to form. Too much chlorine (and) you’d feel the itch and discomfort on (your) skin,” said Jonas Su, operations director of pool maintenance company Anwill. Normally, at the end of a servicing, his team adds chlorine even if the pool passes muster, as the reading would drop. “By adding a little bit more, probably it’ll shoot up … still within the ideal range,” he said. “It’ll last for a few days before we come again.” Other parameters for testing pool cleanliness include the pH value, colour and turbidity (cloudiness) of the water. By regulation, the pH value — which shows the level of acidity or alkalinity — should be between 7.2 and 7.8. But when Talking Point submitted samples from 10 public pools — in Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Bishan, Clementi, Jalan Besar, Jurong East, Kallang Basin, Queenstown, Tampines and Yishun — to Marchwood for testing, half of them were not within this range. “It’s not a concern,” said Marchwood’s Tan, who described the readings of 8.1 to 8.3 as “slightly higher”. “But any pH that’s above nine will cause some skin irritation.” Marchwood also tested the samples for faecal bacteria, namely E. coli and the coliform count. By the National Environment Agency’s standards, there should not be more than 200 bacteria per millilitre of water. And all the samples met this standard as well as the other test parameters. Besides adding chlorine to pools, the cleaning process includes scooping up debris and vacuuming the bottom of the pools. This can be a laborious task. What swimmers can do for personal hygiene on their part is relatively simple, however, like having a quick rinse before entering the pool to get rid of dirt, as well as applying moisturiser and sunblock if needed. Although moisturisers would contribute to the formation of chloramine, Tan the dermatologist said their use would help buffer the effects of chlorine or chloramine on skin. There are “two broad groups” of moisturisers: One has the “building blocks” of skin to repair the skin; the other acts as a protective barrier. “So it depends on a patient’s preference and the skin conditions,” she said. “Generally, you’d want something slightly oilier because you want the moisturiser to last for the duration of the swim … The ones that are more water-resistant would help as well.\" She also recommended having a rinse immediately after leaving the pool to “get rid of all the chlorine”. She added: “If possible, use a gentle cleanser (for) a more complete removal.” For extra assurance, swimmers can even get a test strip online that shows the pH and chlorine levels of the water on the spot.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "47538", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54751", "source": "scrapy"},

On March 11, Premier Li Keqiang defended the government's decision to set a relatively low bar for the economy after delivering his annual work report to the National People's Congress (NPC) with a growth goal of \"over 6 percent.\" At a press conference, Li pushed back at the notion that the government had deliberately low-balled the recovery from the pandemic following gross domestic product growth of 2.3 percent in 2020, the slowest rate in 44 years. \"A growth target of over 6 percent is not low considering the size of the Chinese economy, and the target is set to guide expectations to consolidate economic recovery foundation and pursue high-quality development,\" state media quoted Li as saying. While the official rates reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) are open to question, China is thought to be the only major economy to show any growth at all in 2020, with expansion taking hold only in the second half. The government's forecast for this year is unusual on several counts. First, it is considerably lower than the International Monetary Fund's revised outlook in January, which called for GDP growth of 8.1 percent. China's official results for 2020 exceeded the IMF's growth forecast of 1.9 percent last October. The IMF is expected to update its forecasts at its spring meeting in the coming week. In prior years. the government targets and IMF forecasts have routinely served as a floor for the GDP growth figures reported by the NBS, giving the Communist Party the opportunity to sing the praises of its centrally-planned economic policies. Expectations for China's economy this year have been flying high. In January, the World Bank pegged this year's growth rate at 7.9 percent. Last month, Fitch Ratings Inc. raised its forecast from 8 percent to 8.4 percent, citing strong export growth and global demand. But the government has kept its target at the lower level, raising questions about whether it has full confidence in the recovery. It has also broken with tradition by deciding not to set any growth goal for the 2021-2025 period of the 14th Five- Year Plan. At last year's delayed NPC session in May, the government omitted a growth target for 2021, citing the uncertainty of the pandemic. The absence of growth goals has left local governments without the customary guidance from central authorities on what the pace should be for 2022 and the rest of the five- year plan. The IMF has forecast 5.6-percent growth for 2022, suggesting that expansion will slow after this year's rate is magnified by the base effect of the 2020 slump. In their reports of recent economic data, the NBS and state media have gone out of their way to include comparisons not only to year-earlier performance but also to pre-pandemic results from 2019, helping to avoid the implication that the recovery would lead to runaway growth. In reporting results for the January-February period, for example, the official Xinhua news agency said that retail sales of consumer goods jumped 33.8 percent from a year earlier to over 6.97 trillion yuan (U.S. $1.07 trillion). But Xinhua added that the figure rose only 6.4 percent over the comparable 2019 period, producing an average annual growth rate of only 3.2 percent over two years. Economists have been urging China to abandon the charade of announcing annual GDP growth goals for well over a decade. But the gaps in this relic of central planning may now leave the direction of policy adrift. The departures from traditional target-setting are a reflection of the continuing uncertainties of the economic damage caused by the COVID crisis, raising questions about how long the economy will need to recover from its recovery. The official target for this year and the IMF forecast for 2022 may be taken as signs that China will return to its pre- pandemic course of gradually declining growth rates in time. Li's explanations have tried to dispel the notion that the government has deliberately set the bar low so that it can jump over it more easily. This year's goal is \"not set in stone\" and actual growth may be faster, said Li, according to Xinhua. Li acknowledged that the economy is growing from an \"incomparable base\" of the 2020 plunge, while the pace of global recovery remains to be seen. Li also voiced caution about preventing \"wild swings in economic performance\" and efforts to keep expectations \"stable.\" \"A growth too fast will not be a steady one. You need a steady pace to sustain China's development for the long run,\" he said. In a video address to the China Development Forum on March 22, Li repeated his insistence that the growth goal was \"not low,\" suggesting that the target has been the subject of continuing controversy. In apparent support for the government's position, a report by China Economist, published by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, forecast that first-quarter growth would reach 8 percent, but would settle back to \"about 6 percent\" for the year. Industrial interests that habitually push for faster growth policies may be able to point to the IMF and other high growth forecasts to argue that Li's goals are too restrained. Derek Scissors, an Asia economist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said the government is trying to head off another bout of binge borrowing to finance excessive growth, and is not concerned about coming up short of the IMF forecast. \"They're not anticipating anything seriously negative, and they don't care about the IMF,\" Scissors said by e-mail. \"They want to check risk in the financial system -- not necessarily reduce it, but limit it. Six percent instead of 8 percent is to discourage expansive provincial borrowing,\" he said. The government is anxious to avoid the frenzy of previous growth spurts, when annual targets announced by the central government served as a go-signal for provincial and local officials to overshoot with double-digit production and infrastructure projects aimed at advancing their careers. Signs of concern have already started to show in the banking sector as yuan-denominated loans in February jumped nearly 50 percent from a year earlier to 1.36 trillion yuan (U.S. $208.6 billion), Xinhua said. The government is also likely to be wary of touching off another energy and environmental splurge at a time of limited domestic resources, rising concern about import dependence and pressure over climate change policy. During the past winter months, much of the country struggled with electricity shortages, higher coal costs, fluctuating natural gas prices and air quality problems. The government also faces pressure over President Xi Jinping's deadlines for reaching a peak in carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving \"net-zero\" carbon neutrality before 2060. \"It will be like walking a tightrope to balance emission reductions with ever-increasing demand for energy,\" said a report last month by Caixin Global.  \"We need to seek a balance between, growth, income and employment, and we cannot pursue economic growth based on high energy consumption and heavy pollution,\" Li said in his remarks to the development forum on March 22.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13700", "source": "scrapy"},

The video of DeSantis’ roundtable discussion last month at the state Capitol in Tallahassee was removed on Wednesday because it violated the social media platform’s standards, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said. It had been embedded in a Tampa-area   and it's removal was flagged by the  , a \"free market\" think tank based in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. “YouTube has clear  to support the health and safety of our users,” Hernandez said in a statement. “We removed AIER’s video because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19.” Hernandez said YouTube only allows videos “that otherwise   to remain on the platform if they contain sufficient educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context.” “Our policies apply to everyone and focus on content regardless of the speaker or channel,” Hernandez said. DeSantis's press secretary Cody McCloud called YouTube's move \"another blatant example of Big Tech attempting to silence those who disagree with their woke corporate agenda.\" \"YouTube claimed they removed the video because 'it contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities,' yet this roundtable was led by world-renowned doctors and epidemiologists from Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard, all of whom are eminently qualified to speak on the global health crisis,\" McCloud said. \"Good public health policy should include a variety of scientific and technical expertise, and YouTube’s decision to remove this video suppresses productive dialogue of these complex issues.\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, one of the scientists on the panel, said this \"was a policy forum, in which it is appropriate to consider both the benefits and costs of a policy (child masking) when making judgments and recommendations.\" \"YouTube’s censorship of our discussion is contrary to American democratic norms of free expression,\" the professor said in an email. \"It is also a violation of basic standards of scientific conduct, which stand in opposition to unreasoned silencing of contrary views and require the free exchange of ideas.\" Earlier, AIER editorial director Jeffrey A. Tucker insisted  Wednesday on the think tank’s website that YouTube censored DeSantis and the scientists and called it “the latest attack on public health information.” Many public health experts, however, have accused Bhattacharya and the other scientists on the panel with DeSantis — former Trump White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Scott Atlas; epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta; and Dr. Martin Kulldorff — of spreading public health misinformation. NBC News has also reached out to Tucker, Atlas, Gupta and Kulldorff for comment. NBC News did not see the video before it was removed. Tucker first reported its removal. But based on a transcript provided by YouTube, it appears the participants ran afoul of the platform’s standards when DeSantis asked whether children in school should be wearing masks and Kulldorff replied, “Uh, children should not wear face masks, no. They don’t need it for their own protection, and they don’t need it for protecting other people either.” Less than a minute later, Bhattacharya chimed-in, saying that mask-wearing “is developmentally inappropriate and it just doesn’t help on the disease spread.” “There’s no scientific rationale or logic to have children wear masks in school,” Atlas said six minutes later. That language also appears in the   with his article. Those claims run counter to the recommendations of the federal  , which advises that “people age 2 and older should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household.” The  recommendations are a bit looser for younger children, but kids age 12 and over “should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults.” All the scientists in the video but Atlas are signatories to  , which was   and which opposed lockdowns and argued that society would build herd immunity against Covid-19 if all but people over age 70 “resume life as normal.” Atlas, who is  , was especially  to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Many of the world’s leading scientists denounced The Great Barrington Declaration as a “ unsupported by scientific evidence.” And later, then-President Donald Trump’s CDC chief, Dr. Robert Redfield, was overhead by NBC saying of Atlas, “Everything he says is false.” The Trump administration  , as did DeSantis, who was criticized by public health experts for being   and for reopening the state too soon. Most of the Covid-19 deaths and cases were recorded in Florida after DeSantis visited Trump in the White House last April and prematurely, as it turned out, declared  . As of Friday, Florida had reported more than 2 million Covid-19 infections and nearly 35,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to  . It also has the tenth highest Covid-19 infection rate in the country, according to  . DeSantis in the AIER transcript agreed with his panelists that lockdowns were ineffective at stopping the pandemic, saying \"there’s really not a lot of positive to balance it out when you compare the severe lockdown states to other states which weren’t locked down or other countries like Sweden, which had adopted a different approach.\" Sweden   but began imposing restrictions about six months ago after the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths soared,  .", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3463503/210409-ron-desantis-ew-140p_3a4ec2798dd5ef0c3f054116eb5caf60.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Holds News Conference In Miami\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162635", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "44525", "source": "scrapy"},

Their stupendous performance in last year’s IPL earned them a ticket to Team India. Their inclusion has once accentuated the significance of playing well in the IPL. But unfortunately, the competition was so intense that neither of them could find a place in the playing X1 in the ODI team. Krunal Pandya replaced Suryakumar Yadav for the ODIs; in fact, the latter made his ODI debut against England last Tuesday and scored a record 26-ball 50. \r\nSimilarly, despite some good performances, K.L. Rahul is facing stiff competition from Rishab Pant as a wicket-keeping batsman.   And with the next edition of IPL set to happen next month, more new faces are likely to emerge, putting existing performers in trouble. Ishan and Suryakumar were among the 12 batsmen who scored 350-plus runs in last year’s IPL. Naturally, they were drafted into the National side for the recent T-20 series against England. Cricket administrator and former Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW) for Kolkata Knight Riders Makarand Waingankar agrees that IPL has helped many cricketers to play for Team India. He adds that the format has given the players a great opportunity to play against international cricketers much before they make their international debut.   “Youngsters have become fearless because of their IPL stints. The situation is so dynamic that it has become challenging for players to retain their spots in the team,” points out Makarand, and adds that sometimes even top performers have to be dropped because of the competition. “Team India won matches in Australia even without Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, etc. But now if they come back, where do you slot them?” he asks. While former greats like Sachin Tendulkar, M.S. Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, etc., had the luxury of playing the game almost till their 40s, the situation for the current crop looks grim. At a time where even performers are being left out due to high competition, cricketers’ longevity on the field is in jeopardy.   Sports analyst and historian Sunil Yashkalra describes the current situation as a ‘problem of plenty’. Commenting that league tournaments are the germination points of talent, he feels having a long stint like Dhoni, Sachin and Yuvraj could be difficult these days. “Today, longevity depends on not just skill but on temperament and fitness,” shares Sunil. He feels intense fitness will be the key differentiator for longevity in the game. “Vihari has done so well, but just one injury, and he is out of the team. And with the IPL taking place next month, the competition is even more intense, it makes things even tougher. Hence it is significant that a player stays injury-free,” he stresses.   Former Indian cricketer and former coach of the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, Lalchand Rajput, reminisces that during his tenure, fitness was never a parameter. During the ’80s there wasn’t much emphasis on fitness, but only skill, he explains, adding that today, a player first needs to be an athlete to make the cut. Observers feel that while Team India may not soon see the likes of Sachin, Sehwag and Dhoni who played for several years, the BCCI should follow a strict rotation policy, where a mandatory rest is given to players after taking part in a certain number of matches.   Former cricketer and Chief selector M.S.K. Prasad says that before he took charge, there were only 20 players playing all three formats (Test, ODI and T-20). He had visualized developing sustainable bench strength over a period of time to nurture the team to where it is now. “Bench strength (competition) will certainly challenge senior players’ longevity. With youngsters chipping in, it will also push seniors to perform better, so eventually, it will help Team India,” explains Prasad, who points out that Indian won the test series against Australia despite not having its seven main players.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17213", "source": "scrapy"},

The World Health Organization recently warned against labelling viruses based on the place where it originated, for it could trigger racist rhetorics.    On Wednesday, China lashed out and claimed that it has neither created nor intentionally transmitted the virus.

The so-called \"Chinese virus\" is absolutely wrong,\" Ji said. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had faced flak recently for referring to pandemic as “Wuhan virus”. China referred to his words as “despicable behaviour” and an attempt to stigmatise the country. Instances of harassment of people with facial features akin to the Chinese have spurred in India and the US, with many facing attacks on the streets. \"The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the seasonal flu starting from September 2019 has so far sickened more than 30 million people and killed more than 20,000, and CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield admitted some were actually COVID-19 (cases),\" Ji said. \"At the early stage of the outbreak, China took a decisive decision to lock down Wuhan and cancel outbound tourist groups to prevent the spread of the epidemic,\" Ji added. According to him, China has shared the diagnostic and treatment aspects of the virus with the world from the beginning very openly. “Since January 3, China has been regularly notifying WHO and relevant countries and regions about the outbreak, and on January 12, it had already shared with WHO the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus”, he added. “China held an online video conference to brief 19 Eurasian and South Asian countries including India on China’s experience”, the spokesperson added. \"The Chinese enterprises have started to make donations to India. We stand ready to provide further support and assistance to the best of our capability in light of the needs of the Indian side. We believe that the Indian people will win the battle at an early date,\" he said. Cases of infections of the deadly coronavirus surpassed 530,000 worldwide on Friday and global deaths rose past 24,000, as COVID-19 spreads across Europe and North America.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/27/134504-untitled-design-3.jpg?itok=wtRLpvi2\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22585", "source": "scrapy"},

Hundreds of thousands of people in the Arab world are turning to Clubhouse, the fast-growing audio chat app, to mock and vent against longtime rulers, debate sensitive issues from abortion to sexual harassment, or argue where to find the best and cheapest shawarma sandwich during an economic crisis. The discussions are endless as they are breathless. More than 970,000 people from the Middle East have downloaded the new platform since it launched outside the U.S. in January. It has offered space for in-person conversations in an age where direct contact is at the mercy of the pandemic and it’s brought together those at home and the many in exile or abroad. But mostly, it has offered a release for bottled-up frustration in a region where violent conflicts and autocrats have taken hold and where few, if any, avenues for change — or even for speaking out — seem tenable. “It is an open coffeehouse that pierces through what is forbidden by the political regimes in the region,” said Diana Moukalled, a Lebanese journalist who closely follows social platforms. “Clubhouse has made people go back to debating one another.” The Middle East accounts for 6.1 percent of the 15.9 million global downloads of Clubhouse, which launched in the United States a year ago. Saudi Arabia ranks no. 7 globally for the invitation-only downloads, with over 660,000, just after Thailand and before Italy, according to San Francisco-based mobile app analytics firm Sensor Tower. One reason for its popularity seems to be the no-holds-barred atmosphere, fueled by the liveliness of group conversation. Saudis organized rooms to discuss who could replace their aging king instead of his ambitious son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They argued with Egyptians over what they considered democracy and with Lebanese and Jordanians over their kingdom’s perceived meddling in their affairs. Other rooms tackle taboo topics ranging from atheism to homosexuality. A Saudi woman discussed whether abortions should be allowed in the kingdom, prompting a heated back and forth. The platform also became a place to exchange information, challenging the region’s largely state-dominated media. Minutes after reports of an attempted coup in Jordan last week, Jordanians inside and outside the country congregated in a room to share information on the confusing reports released and controlled by the government. Families of those arrested in the ensuing sweep shared their news. Some users defended King Abdullah while backers of the brother prince accused of the coup vowed to rally behind him. Previously unimaginable debates took place among parts of society who would otherwise shun or block each other on other social media. Opponents debated supporters of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group. Elsewhere, Lebanese railed against private banks they blame for their country’s economic meltdown — with bankers in the room. In another room, Iraqis — mainly exiles — criticized how their country’s many religious militias impacted their lives. The moderator, a woman from the southern Shiite city of Najaf now living in Europe, told how her conservative family tried to mold her into “being like them” and opposed sending her to universities where men and women mingle. She fended off one man who suggested she was exaggerating, telling him he hadn’t experienced what she did. The moderator went on and named figures from powerful Shiite militias and religious leaders, saying she’d seen how they flout the rules they set for others. In the free-flowing conversation, militia supporters frequently interrupted, sparking a torrent of expletives from the moderator and others until they were forced to leave. “They controlled the ground with their muscles,” the moderator said of the militias. “But social media need brains. This (space) is ours.” Among the hundreds of rooms discussing the war in Syria, some users decided to lighten the mood. Opposition activists organized a spoof interview with someone posing as President Bashar Assad. It drew laughs but also poignant reminders of how the 10-year conflict devastated the country. “I ran away from you and still you follow me to Clubhouse,” one exiled Syrian told the fake “Assad.” But concerns are mounting that the open space could quickly come under the same government surveillance or censorship as other social media. A decade ago, activists in the Arab Spring protests flocked to Twitter and Facebook, which offered a similar free space. Since then, authorities have come to use the sites to target and arrest critics and spread their own propaganda. Oman has already blocked the Clubhouse app. In Jordan, it is obstructed on certain mobile networks, while in the United Arab Emirates, users have described unexplainable glitches. Pro-government commentators have railed against Clubhouse in TV shows and newspapers, accusing it of helping terrorists plan attacks, spreading pornography or undermining religious and state figures. First, Clubhouse drew rights defenders and political activists. Then came the government backers. “This room has grown because Salman’s people are here to defend him,” shouted a participant in a room featuring opponents of the Saudi crown prince. A discussion of the release of imprisoned Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul’s devolved into panicked mayhem when a few participants threatened to expose attendees and report them to authorities. The chat soon cut off. Recordings surfaced online from Clubhouse conversations deemed offensive, such as about homosexuality becoming acceptable, fueling fears that pro-government Saudi users were keeping tabs on critics. One participant asked to leave a chat among Lebanese when it was discovered she was Israeli, in part because some users feared they could be prosecuted under Lebanese laws banning mixing with Israelis. Some fear security agents are secretly in the rooms. Most participants in the app, which remains exclusive to iPhone users, use real names and sometimes put detailed bios. But growing numbers use fake names. Without anonymity, Clubhouse disagreements could turn into violence in real life, said Ali Sibai, a consultant with Beirut-based digital rights group Social Media Exchange, SMEX. Clubhouse’s “vague” policies also raise concerns, he said. The company says it temporarily stores conversations for investigating abuses. But it doesn’t say for how long or who reviews the Arabic content, raising questions whether unknown third parties may be involved, endangering participants’ security, he said. Moukalled, editor of Daraj, an independent online media, said it would be no surprise if authorities impose surveillance on Clubhouse. But, she said, something else would come along. “So long as people don’t feel they are part of the decision-making process, they will find these platforms.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/rockcms/2021-04/918/210409-clubhouse-app-al-1201-3a94fb_4f2406532eabed7266e7b8828c7f4aa9aba2a8ea.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Clubhouse App\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162729", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Jim Smith, a 27-year veteran of the Iowa State Patrol.", "text": "LIBERTY, Mo. (AP) — A 27-year veteran of the Iowa State Patrol was shot and killed during a violent standoff with a man who fought back against agents in an armored personnel carrier and said he wanted to shoot other officers, authorities said Saturday. Sgt. Jim Smith was killed Friday night in Grundy Center as he and other officers entered the home of Michael Thomas Lang, 41, who fled there after an earlier police pursuit, authorities said. The standoff ended about midnight Friday when a team of highway patrol troopers in an armored personnel carrier smashed into the home. Lang fired multiple shots at the carrier. Three officers inside the carrier returned fire, hitting the man several times, authorities said. Lang was hospitalized in critical condition on Saturday. He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held on $1 million bond. Iowa Department of Public Safety Commissioner Steve Bayens said Smith “died a hero” and “sacrificed himself protecting others.” “We are hurting, we are angry,” Bayens said. “But rest assured we’re not broken. We will continue to shoulder the burdens of our communities while carrying our own. We will continue to stand in the gap of good and evil because, like Jim, that is what we are called to do.” Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of the division of criminal investigation, said events began at 7:22 p.m. on Friday when a Grundy Center officer tried to stop Lang for a traffic violation. Lang was known to Grundy City officers and was not supposed to be driving, he said. Lang fled but eventually stopped and assaulted the officer, Mortvedt said. During the assault, Lang yelled “Shoot Me” at the officer several times, and Lang disarmed the officer of his gun and stun gun and put him in a chokehold, he added. A Grundy County deputy arrived and told Lang to drop his gun. Lang instead yelled “Come get me” and got into his vehicle. He ended up at his home, and several law enforcement officers arrived, Mortvedt said. Lang’s father arrived and told officers his son had multiple weapons in the house. Four Iowa patrol troopers, including Smith, and a K-9 unit, entered the home, and Smith was shot as officers tried to clear the house, he said. Two members of the team retreated into the basement while other officers pulled Smith out. Lang barricaded himself for several hours. Officers who were in the basement said Lang made several statements about shooting Smith and “expressed the desire to shoot more police officers,” he said. About 11:50 p.m., a patrol team tried to enter the home in the armored personnel carrier and exchanged gunfire with Lang, Mortvedt said. No other officers were injured. Gov. Kim Reynolds said she plans to order flags flown at half-staff in Smith’s memory. “It’s with deep sorrow that we recognize the loss of Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Jim Smith, a courageous hero who died in the line of duty,” Reynolds said in a statement Saturday. “Sgt. Jim Smith was a loving husband, father of two, and a pillar of the community. I along with the entire state of Iowa grieve for his family and friends as they try to cope with this devastating loss. Today we are once again reminded of the selfless sacrifices the brave men and women in uniform make. Let us never forget their bravery and that of their loved ones.” Smith is the 11th trooper to die in the line of duty in the patrol’s history. The last death was on Sept. 20, 2011, when Trooper Mark Toney died in a crash in Warren County as he tried to make a traffic stop.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162619", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "57777", "source": "scrapy"},

(AP) — A sixth person has died following a shooting earlier this week at the hands of a former NFL player who also killed four members of a South Carolina family, local officials said Saturday. Robert Shook, 38, an air conditioning technician from Cherryville, North Carolina, has died from injuries sustained in the Wednesday shooting while he was working at the home, according to York County Coroner Sabrina Gast. Authorities say Phillip Adams killed Rock Hill physician Robert Lesslie; his wife, Barbara; two of their grandchildren, 9-year-old Adah Lesslie and 5-year-old Noah Lesslie; and another air conditioning technician, James Lewis, who had been working with Shook at the Lesslie home. Adams later shot himself to death. His brain is now being examined for possible degenerative disease that has been shown to cause violent mood swings and other cognitive disorders in some athletes and members of the military. Adams, 32, played in 78 NFL games over six seasons for six teams. He joined the 49ers in 2010 as a seventh-round draft pick out of South Carolina State, and though he rarely started, he went on to play for New England, Seattle, San Francisco, Oakland and the New York Jets before finishing his career with the Atlanta Falcons in 2015. As a rookie, Adams suffered a severe ankle injury and never played for the 49ers again. Later, with the Raiders, he had two concussions over three games in 2012. Whether he suffered long-lasting concussion-related injuries wasn’t immediately clear. Adams would not have been eligible for testing as part of a broad settlement between the league and former players over such injuries, because he hadn’t retired by 2014.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162619", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "56997", "source": "scrapy"},

According to two former U.S. officials, “illegal, unregulated fishing by Chinese vessels has become common in American Samoa and Guam and as far east as Hawaii.” Samoa, noted for its volcanic peaks and tropical rainforests, is the southernmost territory of the United States. At one point, a tuna cannery on American Samoa, one of the island’s largest employers, had to temporarily suspend operations due to a lack of fish. China’s fishing fleets, which reach as far as Latin America, West Africa, and even Antarctica, have been adding to the strain on worldwide fishing stocks, according to organizations monitoring the issue. In the past, the expansion of Chinese fishing vessels and their overseas reach has been fueled by tax breaks on imported fishing equipment purchased abroad, and by subsidies for fuel and vessel building. But it’s not clear how much of a role these factors have played in the South Pacific. Members of a Chinese middle class who value high-quality fish in their diet are believed to be eager to acquire the tuna fish which can be found in the South Pacific. Another much sought-after item is sea cucumber. Sea cucumbers are marine invertebrates related to sea urchins and star fish. They are used in soups and other dishes. Sea cucumbers are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat fatigue, impotence, constipation, and joint pain. Other countries’ fishing vessels operate in the South Pacific as well. Several years ago, the authorities in Palau burned four Vietnamese fishing boats off the island’s coast and arrested a captain. And a few years later, several Vietnamese boats were detained off the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia. The Solomon Islands are a former British territory. New Caledonia, located 750 miles east of Australia, is noted for its palm-lined beaches and lagoon, which is a major scuba-diving destination. But tourism, a major source of income and employment in the South Pacific, has dropped off here and elsewhere in the region. In some cases local authorities have pushed back against Chinese fishing boat intrusions. The Republic of Palau, a Pacific island nation whose close relations with Taiwan have angered China in the past, detained a Chinese fishing vessel and six smaller boats in early December last year. According to   newspaper, Palau officials alleged that the Chinese boats had been harvesting sea cucumbers in its territorial waters. Palau, an archipelago of about 500 islands and 18,000 people is one of Taiwan’s few remaining allies in the South Pacific. Last year, Palau asked the United States to build ports, bases, and airfields on its islands, according to a   report, but it’s not clear where that offer currently stands. Meanwhile John Braddock, reporting for the “World Socialist Web Site,” described how Vanuatu officials seized two Chinese vessels in late January of this year for illegally fishing in the southwestern Pacific island nation’s territorial waters. But not all Chinese fishing vessels operate illegally. Some Chinese fishing boats are legitimately operating in Vanuatu’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from a base in Fiji. A South Pacific Tuna Treaty, an ongoing agreement between the United States and 16 Pacific Island nations, allows for purse-seine vessels to legitimately fish in the EEZs party to the treaty. Purse-seining involves setting a large circular “wall” of net around fish, then “pursing” the bottom together to capture them. But according to the nonprofit organization Greenpeace, purse seining is a bad idea when it also targets a by-catch of non-target species or fish that simply can’t stand the pressure on their populations. In the worst case, some fish can be driven to extinction by simply failing to maintain a large enough population to propagate the species. For skipjack, the smallest species and the staple of tinned tuna, purse-seining is used throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. But skipjack tuna often shoal together with younger big eye and yellow fin tuna, and these end up in the nets as well along with sharks, rays, turtles, and other species of fish. Big eye tuna is used as sashimi, a popular dish in both Japan and South Korea. As Greenpeace notes, given the endangered species of Oceanic turtles, sharks, and big eye tuna, as well as the appetite for sushi around the world, the losers are traditional fishing communities who have been catching these fish with a minimal impact for centuries. In addition to the damage to local livelihoods caused by Chinese and other fishing boats, it should be mentioned that another tragic development has been the destruction of tropical forests in the South Pacific. Most of this has been carried out by companies shipping timber to China. As of 2018, China had become the world’s largest timber importer followed by the United States, the European Union, and Japan. Meanwhile, two former high-ranking U.S. officials have argued that U.S. territories and possessions in the Pacific find themselves “on the front lines of Beijing’s malign influence, economic predation, and military ambitions.” Writing for the web site “RealClearDefense” on March 11 of this year, Alexander B. Gray and Douglas W. Domenech allege that “not since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, has a foreign power such as China posed such a direct military threat in close proximity to the U.S. mainland.” But the two allege that “Washington policymakers have thus far barely recognized the growing threat to vital American interests on our own territory or in adjacent waters.” Gray is a senior fellow in national security affairs at the American Foreign Policy Institute who served on the National Security Council from 2018 to 2021. Domenech served as assistant security for insular and international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Interior from 2017 to 2021.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"Fishing2.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/china-pacific-fishing-04062021143253.html/fishing2.jpg/@@images/23b24a79-95e6-4140-b091-4d5b0aa8bd37.jpeg\" title=\"Fishing2.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162728", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13374", "source": "scrapy"},

Tech experts say the move to bring the country more in step with the rest of the digital world is crucial, but will cause \"chaos\" in a rocky transition period. Myanmar is the   to embrace unicode that has significant numbers of people online. Without it, most users see international content -- and a lot from within the country -- as lines of meaningless symbols. Household name websites can be impossible to read while translation and voice recognition software do not work. October 1 is \"U-Day\", when Myanmar officially adopts the new system. From then on, all electronic communication from government offices, telecoms companies, banks and media must be in Unicode by law. Myanmar became a global code anomaly due to isolation under its former military junta. Microsoft and Apple helped other countries standardise years ago, but Western sanctions meant Myanmar lost out. IT pioneer Zaw Htut, 47, describes this as the final battle won in a decades-long code \"war\". \"This is like changing to democracy,\" he enthuses. However, making the switch to Unicode will be a turbulent ride, and he warned that initially there will be \"chaos\". Facebook -- the main social media platform in the country -- has developed automatic conversion software to give users a \"seamless experience\", says strategic response team member Sarah Oh. But many will suddenly be unable to read messages on other apps and from banks or phone operators, while those who switch will no longer be able to communicate with friends still using the old system. A homegrown rival to Unicode called \"Zawgyi\" (pronounced: zaw-jee) -- meaning wizard -- evolved in Myanmar's detached digital ecosystem. Its popularity exploded as the country opened up from 2011 and smartphone use soared. Today around 90 per cent of people use Zawgyi instead of Unicode. Incompatible without fiddly plug-ins, it only allows people to communicate in Burmese with other Zawgyi users, excluding the nation's minority languages. Its clunkiness also means search functions do not work, crippling data storage systems. According to tech experts, it could take years to achieve full migration. Zaw Htut compares the abrupt switch to Unicode with the former junta's overnight decision for   to drive on the right instead of the left. \"But we're digitally empowering the nation,\" he said. Joox, a regional version of Spotify, said it is impossible to convert the millions of Burmese language songs on its app. With the deadline looming, celebrities and influencers are hammering home the need to convert while technicians prepare for a deluge of queries. An army of volunteers are helping in online forums and offline at teashops. \"There's a lot of confusion,\" explains computer science student Tin Lat Nandar, 23, as she updates retirees' phones at a Sunday drop-in session. Yangon street vendor Mi Mi, 35, says she has heard about the switch but does not want to change.  \"I don't know how to do it\", she said. An estimated 10 to 15 per cent of mainly older phones will not be advanced enough to convert. Many cheaper, illegally imported devices even come pre-installed with the old system -- putting those too poor to buy newer models at a clear disadvantage. Still others are excited at the wealth of information now at their fingertips. \"I'll be able to read Wikipedia in Burmese,\" says a beaming Aung Kyaw Oo, 62, as he leaves a drop-in session.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/09/27/111489-untitled-design-9.jpg?itok=-0gRDYRB\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162729", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22190", "source": "scrapy"},

The Southeast Asian archipelago is one of the most disaster-prone nations on Earth.  It experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", where tectonic plates collide.  Last year, a 7.5-magnitude quake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing.  Nearly 60,000 people are still living in makeshift accommodation nearly a year after the double disaster, the Red Cross said this week.  In 2004, a devastating 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including around 170,000 in Indonesia.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/09/27/111492-untitled-design-11.jpg?itok=1DZ-R64Z\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162734", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21121", "source": "scrapy"},

It also comes as an opportunity for those seeking to make a shift toward healthier living. Well, why not start today! As per World Health Organisation (WHO), this year's  World Health Day theme is 'Building a fairer, healthier world'.  Stating that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the countries hard, WHO mentioned that ours is an unequal world where \"some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income...little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services.\" WHO urged leaders around the world to \"monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.\" And while people across the globe are still struggling to come to terms with how much life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a U.K.-based price comparison website Money.co.uk has come out with a list of the world’s healthiest countries in 2021. The publications release this list every year and this time too it has been published on World Health Day.  The publication mentioned that their mortgage experts rank the healthiest countries and cities in the world on the basis of \"good food, good company and good transport links\". Additionally, conditions like air quality, pollution levels, cost of living, life expectancy among other things are taken into consideration.  Below is the list of the top 5 world's healthiest countries. According to the report, Spain is the healthiest country in the world. It mentioned a few reasons such as their Mediterranean lifestyle, walking as a mode of transport, which helps to lower deaths caused by pollution, cost of living is moderate among other things why the country topped their list.  l: As per the report, Portugal bagged the second spot on the list of the world's healthiest countries. Their high-ranking healthcare system is the reason why the country has achieved good rankings in several health indices over the years, including this one.  Switzerland is home to one of the happiest populations. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum's 2013 Human Capital Report, Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world.  Home to the oldest living population in the world, Japan obviously has one of the highest life expectancies in the world! Other factors that contribute to Japan being in the top five are: their smaller portion sizes and protein-dense diet, their notoriously fast transportation, walking as the preferred mode of transportation and high cost of living matched with the price among other things.   Good healthcare system, healthy diet and clean water among other things such as low levels of smoking, makes Iceland one of the world's healthiest countries to live in. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162732", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34613", "source": "scrapy"},

Some moments and memories are so special that all it takes is a small sensory cue to take one to a different timeline of one's life. This is often captured by the expression 'madeleine de proust' one of the key passages in Marcel Proust book 'In search of lost time' when a particular sight, smell, food, a song, or an experience unexpectedly unlocks a past recollection. For instance, the smell of jasmine flowers reminds me of my grandmother and how fondly she used to place them near her pillow. It's not uncommon when a simple song triggers a plethora of past memories. No wonder when sometimes I miss my mother near me, I try to do or make something exactly the way she does to intentionally create a madeleine moment and then soak myself in the nostalgia and priceless feelings associated with childhood memories. The reverse is also true. There are events or moments of life thinking about which can make one feel awful. It could be related to anything in the past like the unexpected loss of a loved one, changing dynamics of cherished relationships, emotionally taxing incidents or the struggles in the present moment that instantly makes one negative. Sometimes when a negative situation stays for too long, it can leave one overwhelmed in a way that the person seems to be addicted to negativity or develops a habit of ruminating. For instance, acting as a caregiver where hopes are not high, clinging to a toxic relationship or sticking with the wrong job because of one's helpless condition perceived or real. Rumination is continuously getting lost in a thought loop where you eventually end up thinking about that same negative or sad thought or experience. Why is it that we end up remembering what we want to forget? Perhaps negative emotions can sometimes be so strong that even when an individual has made a conscious thought to not pay heed to it, it keeps coming back. One of the reasons people ruminate is owing to the belief that by ruminating they will probably get an insight into their life or problem. However, it doesn't work out because in a state of ruminating the person is focused more on the problems and consequences instead of solutions. The person may perceive it as natural coping mechanism to adapt with the pain, but one has to ponder whether it's helping one solve a problem or just trapping back in an unhealthy thought cycle. Dwelling on negative thoughts and engaging in self-blame has been associated with mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Research by Peter Kinderman professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they had experienced many negative events in their lives. The question is how to intentionally forget things that only serve to disturb us. Can we exercise influence on our memory? Perhaps the easiest way to forget something is not revisiting it in your mind. There are many theories related to the process of motivated forgetting that suggest that people forget things because they either do not want to remember them or for another particular reason. According to Freud, memories that are likely to induce guilt, embarrassment, shame or anxiety are actively, but unconsciously, pushed out of consciousness as a form of ego defence. Unconscious or repressed memories are exceedingly difficult to retrieve but remain available. People may resort to 'repression' in which they subconsciously push unpleasant thoughts and feelings into their unconscious as an automatic defensive mechanism. Thought 'suppression' is also a  type of motivated forgetting when an individual consciously attempts to stop thinking about a particular thought. Memories are also forgotten through distortion as perGestalt theory of forgetting. This is also called false memory syndrome in which a person's identity and relationships are affected by false memories, recollections that are factually incorrect but yet are strongly believed. Rehearsing negative memories by ruminating over them only serve to strengthen them, so it's important to forget certain things to live life peacefully. Apparently, we may never forget things completely but when we stop thinking about them, it often fades away as we remember fewer facts. If rumination is affecting your personal growth stop and take notice of the circumstances and triggers that lead you to ruminate. Eliminating the trigger may not be possible always but by practicing mindfulness one can consciously try to respond with an element of awareness breaking the cycle of negative thoughts. This may require consistent practice and conscious efforts but it's important to check yourself lest negativity pulls you into a trap again. Finding a distraction like going for a walk, playing a game, calling a friend, watching a movie or getting engaged in any activity that breaks the chain can also be helpful. If constant rumination is disabling you and you are unable to focus your attention on other important things of life, seeking therapy can be beneficial. Otherwise meditating can also reduce rumination because it helps in de cluttering the mind to arrive at an emotionally calm state. Life is fleeting and made up of a collection of moments. Clinging on to negative experiences will only make us miss out on the beauty of 'now'.Next time if your answer to this question 'Do you remember what you want to forget?' carries away your mind to unpleasant memories and events, change the question itself. Ask yourself - 'Do you forget what you want to remember?' Answering it will not only break the thought cycle and distract your mind but transport you to all the beautiful memories and the blessings in the present moment, that perhaps money can't buy but fills the heart with gratitude.

He was 93. Clark, whose father, Tom Clark, was attorney general and U.S. Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his Manhattan home, a family member, Sharon Welch, announced to media outlets   After serving in President Lyndon Johnson’s Cabinet in 1967 and ’68, Clark set up a private law practice in New York in which he championed civil rights, fought racism and the death penalty, and represented declared foes of the United States including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He also defended former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. New York civil rights attorney Ron Kuby, who worked with Clark on numerous cases, called the death “very, very sad in a season of losses.” “The progressive legal community has lost its elder dean and statesman,” Kuby said. “Over many generations, Ramsey Clark was a principled voice, conscience and a fighter for civil and human rights.” In courtrooms around the country Clark defended antiwar activists. In the court of public opinion, he charged the United States with militarism and arrogance, starting with the Vietnam War and continuing with Grenada, Libya, Panama and the Gulf War. When Clark visited Iraq after Operation Desert Storm and returned to accuse the United States of war crimes, Newsweek dubbed him the Jane Fonda of the Gulf War. Clark said he only wanted the United States to live up to its ideals. “If you don’t insist on your government obeying the law, then what right do you have to demand it of others?” he said. The lanky, soft-spoken Texan went to Washington in 1961 as a New Frontiersman in President John F. Kennedy’s Justice Department. He was 39 when Johnson made him attorney general in 1967, the second youngest ever — Robert Kennedy had been 36. Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark, who had been Harry Truman’s attorney general before he joined the high court in 1949, swore in his son as attorney general, then retired to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. Ramsey Clark said his work at Justice drew him into the civil rights revolution, which he called “the noblest quest of the American people in our time.” He also maintained opposition to the death penalty  , defended the right of dissent and criticized FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when no one else in government would dare take him on. But as Johnson’s attorney general, Clark had the job of prosecuting Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling Vietnam-era youths to resist the draft, a position with which he sympathized. “We won the case, that was the worst part,” he said years later. The Dallas-born Clark, who did a hitch in the Marine Corps in 1945-46, moved his family to New York in 1970 and set up a pro bono-oriented practice. He said then that he and his partners were limiting their annual personal incomes to $50,000, a figure he did not always achieve. “Money’s not an interest of mine,” he said, but at the same time he was meeting steep medical bills for his daughter, Ronda, who was born with severe disabilities. He and his wife, Georgia, who were married in 1949, also had a son, Thomas, a lawyer. Clark took one shot at elective office, losing the 1976 Democratic Senate primary to Daniel P. Moynihan. Clark’s client list included such peace and disarmament activists as the Harrisburg 7 and the Plowshares 8. Abroad, he represented dissidents in Iran, Chile, the Philippines and Taiwan, and skyjackers in the Soviet Union. He was an advocate for Soviet and Syrian Jews, but outraged many Jews over other clients. He defended a Nazi prison camp guard fighting extradition, and the Palestine Liberation Organization in a lawsuit over the slaying of a cruise ship passenger by hijackers. There were usually two to three dozen active cases on Clark’s legal calendar, and about 100 more in the background. Capital punishment cases were a staple. “We talk about civil liberties,” he said. “We have the largest prison population per capita on Earth. The world’s greatest jailer is the freest country on Earth?”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162729", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "59035", "source": "scrapy"},

I was governed by the fear of my secret getting out.\"", "text": "Recently, a friend and I were talking about our childhoods, and how so many of our early experiences shape the complicated adults we become. How we can become triggered by seemingly innocuous events and find ourselves reacting to situations in unexpected and often irrational ways. He told me about being bullied in high school and how he does not think he will ever fully recover from the trauma of those years. He said he has “learned to deal with it” and “found a way to move on,” but that it still affects him every day and that he will never forgive the people who “tore his life to shreds.” His words and the pain on his face hit me hard. They brought to mind my own childhood, specifically my preteen years, when I was a bully. I have spent the better part of 40 years “forgetting” those days ― the people I have hurt, the damage I’ve done and the trauma I’ve caused. It all came flooding back. I thought,  I did not start out as a bully. It was a choice. I was a good kid ― smart, funny and full of life. That all changed in the middle of sixth grade when I was 11 years old.  I remember the moment with absolute clarity: It was during a recess break when I was wrestling with one of my classmates. He was one of the boys in my school who was maturing more quickly than the others, including myself. He was tall and ripped. He had the beginnings of a mangy mustache and a voice as deep as Darth Vader’s. He had me on the ground and was straddling my chest. My arms were pinned above my head. We were laughing. He smiled at me. I got an erection. It was the first time I experienced pure panic. I froze. Time stood still as he felt me against him and recognition swept across his face. I heard the words “holy shit” and “faggot,” and saw his smile disappear. I threw him off of me and ran. A single thought followed me:  From an early age, I knew that I was different from other boys, but I did not know that I was gay. I knew full well what being gay meant ― it’s hard to grow up in a small town full of machismo and testosterone and not know what being gay meant. I also knew what a “faggot” was and what a “queer” and a “butt pirate” were and all of those other colorful terms. I knew I couldn’t be any of these things. I believed that being gay was bad ― possibly the worst thing that someone could be. I knew it would get you ostracized, mercilessly bullied and beaten to a pulp. I also knew that it could get you killed. My decision to “not be gay” began that day. The change from happy-go-lucky preteen to disgruntled, petulant asshole happened virtually overnight. As the fear of being discovered began to consume my every waking moment, I set about to obliterate the old me and create someone new. I lived in a kill-or-be-killed world, where the tough feasted on the weak, and where being different made you a target. It was a world where only the strong survived, where you were either predator or prey. I knew people who were prey. They were different, and I thought they were weak. I saw what a living hell their lives were. I witnessed the endless torture they endured at the hands of the more popular kids ― the name-calling and the constant mental and physical abuse and how it affected them. This was not a life for me. In the course of just a few short months, I went from a bright, engaged student to an uninterested, disruptive presence in the classroom. My grades plummeted. I became cocky and combative with my peers, I dumped my old friends for a new, tougher crowd and I found myself a girlfriend. I did whatever I could do to deflect the attention away from me and onto somebody else. Thus began the bullying. I was not particularly big or strong for my age, so intimidation by force was not an option for me ― I found friends for that. What I did have was a quick wit and an uncanny ability to find and exploit weaknesses. I became a psychological assassin. For the unfortunate souls who were more noticeable, like the girl with the dark red birthmark on her face or the chubby boy with Coke-bottle glasses, it was easy. For others, I learned what I could about them and then struck when the opportunity presented itself. My most devious move came with Mike, the boy I was wrestling with when this all began. Why he never told anyone about what happened is beyond me. I still wonder why, when presented with such a golden opportunity, he did not expose me. Perhaps he was a decent, compassionate human being? Perhaps he was one of the good guys? Regardless, he did not attack, so I did. I flipped the script and told everyone the erection was his and that he had tried to “stick it in me.” From then on, his nickname was “ass bandit” and his life was hellish. I survived the remaining two years of middle school this way: attacking first, capitalizing on faults and imperfections and ruining lives. It was remarkably easy. The other kids in my school were all too willing to go along with the game because they, like me, had things to hide. Except it was not a game. People were getting hurt and developing emotional scars. I do not remember feeling bad about the suffering I was causing. So governed by the fear of my secret getting out, I ran a scorched-earth campaign against anyone I felt threatened by, consequences be damned. I did not believe I had a choice ― I thought it was a matter of life and death. When I entered high school, I was forced to adapt using new methods of survival. I ended up in a school on the opposite side of the city away from my friends, where I was suddenly a very small fish in a very big pond and nobody was afraid of me. Alone and vulnerable, I learned to blend in, to camouflage and disguise myself, to keep my head down and my mouth shut. Being invisible was easy and a lot less work than being a bully. I concentrated on my classes and on avoiding Chris, one of my classmates.   Chris Jones was the only “out” gay person in school and the only person I was afraid of. His audacity was overwhelming. How dare he have the strength to be himself, to live an authentic life, to be out and proud and fearless? I would lie awake at night stressing about how easily he could destroy my life. It would only take one glance ― a single moment of recognition ― and everything would come crashing down for me. He would know I was gay, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and he would expose me for the fraud I was. It was equal parts fear and fascination. I longed to be seen ― by him or anyone ― but the terror that elicited was paralyzing. In retrospect, what I really wanted was not to feel so utterly and completely alone.  Today, I see the boy who did those terrible things hiding in the darkness near my heart. He is utterly and completely alone. I reach out to him, tell him that I love him, but I do not think he believes me. He knows that I am deeply ashamed. He knows that I am broken, and he doesn’t trust that a broken man can fix things. He is anxious and afraid and furtive. He runs.  The adult me is all of these things. I battle with depression and a panic disorder. I often do not feel worthy of love. I run. There is a quote by Maya Angelou that reads, “I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” I find some comfort in these words.  What I did then was survive. It was all I knew how to do. I certainly “know better” now, but it is ultimately the “do better” that matters. Perhaps the act of “doing better” is where compassion and forgiveness lie.  Doing better is accepting responsibility for my actions and apologizing to those I hurt. I am truly sorry for the pain I caused, the scars I created and the trauma I inflicted. I know what I did was wrong — terribly wrong — and in no way am I asking for absolution. The idea of reaching out and trying to locate some of my victims and apologizing directly weighs heavy. I want to, but I am afraid. I do not want to reopen any of their old wounds, but perhaps I am simply not yet ready to face the cold, hard consequences of my actions. Doing better means telling this story and starting a conversation. It is not easy to admit to these things in such a public forum. I both expect and accept the criticism that will come my way. A logical response to what I have done is anger and judgement. But past that, on the other side of that, I hope there is reflection and an openness to dialogue. We can only begin to effect change if we are willing to speak our truths, admit when we are wrong and start to listen to each other. ", "image_url": "<img class=\"related-articles__image\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60522cd6240000360025f17e.jpg?cache=qqgzodtxpn&amp;ops=210_120\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162735", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "61934", "source": "scrapy"},

We spoke a few hours before he was executed and some of our last words were spent discussing his last words. For the first time, his optimism was gone. Even the day before, he sounded hopeful because he had heard that the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney  .  Brandon read his speech to the Pardon Office to me before presenting it, and the profound level of remorse he expressed brought me to tears. He was a different person from the teenager arrested over 20 years earlier. Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed. I began writing to death row prisoners after reading Bryan Stevenson’s book   about an innocent man condemned to death row. Books often change my course; I read   a few years ago and haven’t eaten meat since. After reading “Just Mercy,” I sent out postcards to about a dozen death row inmates across the U.S. When I started what my husband, family and friends universally consider an odd hobby, I had no idea how gratifying and life-altering writing death row prisoners would become.   When we first began exchanging letters a year ago, I warned Brandon that I had one other pen pal at Terre Haute federal penitentiary. In my experience, inmates do not want to write someone with multiple pen pals at the same facility out of legitimate concerns over privacy and safety. Brandon’s immediate response was, “Well, then that makes me one of the two luckiest men at Terre Haute.” To call himself lucky after over   23 hours a day in a six-by-eight-foot cell was the first of many lessons in gratitude Brandon taught me. Brandon was 18 when he took part in a robbery gone wrong. He had no prior history of violence. Brandon’s friends carjacked a white couple, Todd and Stacey Bagley, youth ministers innocently offering a ride to kids purportedly in need. Later, Brandon rejoined the group only to see Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the crime, fatally shoot Todd and Stacey in the head at close range. The man who had just shot two people in the head and still had a gun in his hand then ordered Brandon and three other teens to set the car on fire with the couple’s bodies inside.    At trial,  , meaning he offered the jury no alternative perspective on the charges. Brandon was the only accomplice not given an opportunity to plead guilty. The other accomplices pleaded out and received prison sentences; two are home with their families now.  Brandon was falsely portrayed as a hardened high-level gang member. Prosecutors suppressed evidence by their own gang expert that the gang had a 13-tier hierarchy with  . Brandon never got the chance to clarify his case in court — it remained the story poorly told at trial two decades earlier. Five of the nine surviving jurors  , stating that they would not have voted for the death penalty had prosecutors disclosed all facts at trial and had Brandon’s own lawyer competently defended him.   In her dissent written hours before Brandon’s execution, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor   “despite troubling allegations that the Government secured his death sentence by withholding exculpatory evidence and knowingly eliciting false testimony against him. [He] has never had the opportunity to test the merits of those claims in court. Now he never will.” Brandon became the youngest person, based on age when the offense occurred, to be put to death by the federal government in nearly 70 years,  . He was 40 when he died.  Brandon loved his life, even in its limited capacity on death row.   in his decades behind bars. This is no small feat given that death row is like a prison within a prison, with countless oppressive rules and ensuing frustrations.  Brandon mainly spent his time mentoring at-risk youth, reading, crocheting and playing the guitar. Brandon was calmer and more patient than most people I’ve come across; he spoke slowly and thoughtfully and was an avid listener. He never cursed and when I asked if that was for religious reasons, he said, “No, cursing just feels too aggressive to me.” A few days before his execution, Brandon’s family visited him for the last time.  After the visit, Brandon told me there was a hole in the pane of glass. I naively said, “Oh, so you were able to hold hands.” He explained it was an air hole to speak through, not large enough for hands, “But,” he said, “I could smell my mom.” In 20 years, including in his final days, Brandon was never allowed to physically touch a loved one. Never having physical contact is an inhumane daily assault on the soul. Brandon’s case fits the death row profile: His crime and trial took place in Texas, a state that has   of the national total. Brandon’s jury consisted of  . Brandon was Black — despite being 13% of the U.S. population, Blacks   of death row inmates. The victims are white in   of homicide death penalty cases. A recent   found that in executions involving interracial murders since 1976, 295 Black defendants were executed for killing white victims, while only 21 white defendants were executed for killing Black victims. Death row is riddled with racial bias and is disproportionately home to Black men   against a white person. Fairness cannot be achieved. Executions in our country, whether with rope or needle, have always been about race. President Joe Biden has   and to give incentives for states to do the same. There is a simple alternative to government executions: Keep people behind bars without resorting to killing them.   worldwide have abolished the death penalty. Italy abolished the death penalty in 1948;  . In the Netherlands, the last execution took place in 1952; Australia in 1967. Since ending the death penalty in 1976,  . The U.S. is the   to conduct executions. Even Russia stopped executions in 1996. Our country   with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt and Pakistan. We are very late in ending state-sponsored executions. It can be done; last month  . Brandon, with his typical positivity, would say now is the time. Friends sitting on death row for years have taught me many lessons: patience, keeping the conversation real and meaningful, and appreciating what I have.  The hassle of driving my daughter to school is now about holding her hand at stoplights and rolling the windows down so I can feel the air. The freedom. During our daily talks, I never had anything to offer Brandon other than my love and support. He never asked me for a single thing besides friendship. Brandon was religious, but since I’m not, I couldn’t offer him prayers or talk about how heaven is a better place. I could only helplessly listen and tell him that I love him.    were his deep regret to the victims’ families, his love for his own family and, true to his thoughtful nature, he told the prison guards not to let his execution upset them. Our final words to each other were about what he would visualize on the gurney to stay calm. I told him to imagine my arms holding him down instead of straps and he promised he would. I was crying and told him I was sorry I couldn’t save him. He said I saved him with my love.

The team is preparing for the forthcoming IPL to be held from 09 April. As part of the protocol, the entire SRH team has been in quarantine and living in a bio bubble since March 28. Incidentally, the players have not been allowed to go out of their hotel rooms to even start practice until they tested negative for the third time too.   In an interaction with Deccan Chronicle, SRH’s mentor V.V.S. Laxman talks about how his players are upbeat and looking forward to an exciting tournament. “The boys just had a go at the nets and it’s been pretty good,” Laxman shares. “Most of the Indian players played domestic cricket (Vijay Hazare tourney) while the foreign players played for their respective national sides. So we are trying to capitalise this entire week for our practice sessions.” Even so, IPL for Laxman has always been such a tournament in which the players have to gel well as a team. “And the good thing is that we [SRH] always played well as a cohesive unit and that’s been our strength,” he states, adding, “In fact, we are one of the most consistent teams in the last few years.”   Having retained their core group for the 2021 season, SRH looks strong in batting with the likes of David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy, Kane Williamson, Manish Padey, etc. So too, Laxman is quite certain that SRH has the potential to beat any side. But added to the confidence in his team members’ performance is his assurance that the team has taken back lessons from IPL’s last season in Dubai. “I think overall it’s important to get a good quick breakthroughs. I believe winning crucial moments is significant,” he states. The franchise has, nevertheless, been criticised for depending heavily on the top order. But Laxman is undeterred by the talk and says that the team has players who can strengthen middle order too.   “This season players such as Kedar Jadhav will boost our depth in the batting; his experience will not only add diversity but also strike a balance in the line-up,” assures the former India cricketer. The batting great further revels in the fact that the team has got players who can perform in any conditions. None of his confidence in his team, however, means he is blinded to their weaknesses, the mark of a true mentor. “An area we need to work on is to maintain the positive frame of mind and attitude of the players when they are part of the bubble for a long time.”   Laxman is also convinced that as the players have been part of the bio bubble in the earlier series too, getting into the groove will not be so difficult. \r\nEven as the IPL time is being held in India this year, the Hyderabadi batsman is aware that the strategy for tourneys of such magnitude keeps changing. “Strategies change according to the situations, conditions, pitch, opposition, etc. But luckily we’ve got players who can execute strategies even in the toughest conditions. So winning the tournament is all about seizing the momentum early and sustaining it. And for this, players have to be consistent and tough — physically and mentally tough.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162729", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16913", "source": "scrapy"},

Nevertheless Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany would be able to meet its goal of offering every adult a coronavirus jab by the end of the summer.   Just after it received approval from European regulator EMA for use in the bloc, Germany restricted the AstraZeneca jab to under-65s because of insufficient data. After clearing it for older people subsequently, Germany along with several EU nations suspended its use again in mid-March because of clotting fears. Just over a week after allowing its use again, German authorities have now again halted its use among younger people. Merkel insisted however that it is such careful consideration and transparency that can keep the public's confidence in the vaccine.   \"Trust stems from the knowledge that every suspicion, every individual case will be examined,\" she said. The cities of Berlin and Munich, as well as Brandenburg state had announced earlier that they were suspending the vaccine for younger people. Germany's medicines regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), has now reported 31 cases of blood clots in people who have received AstraZeneca, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday. Almost all cases are reportedly in younger and middle-aged women, prompting several German hospitals to suspend the use of the jab for women under 55 this week.   On Monday, Canada also recommended halting the use of the jab for under-55s \"pending further analysis\". The AstraZeneca vaccine has had something of a rollercoaster ride. Britain, which developed it, staunchly supports its use, South Africa has rejected it outright. France has limited its use to over-55s, while Spain has done the same for under-65s. Germany's vaccination campaign has been sluggish, with official figures showing around 11 percent of the population have received a first dose so far.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162735", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17687", "source": "scrapy"},

Amidst a national lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery.   On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American's lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US. Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31. He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.   The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country. No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday mid-night, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas. The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House will not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday.   Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban. I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today, Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden. The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work  and millions more desperate to make ends meet  now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources, he wrote.   In his letter, Hawley wrote that the unemployment rate remains at 6.2 per cent  with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis  and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions, he said. In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said. What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers.   I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programmes to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm, Hawley added.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162735", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17477", "source": "scrapy"},

On behalf of the people of Singapore, I extend my condolences to Your Majesty and the people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Duke of Edinburgh was an exemplary role model for the British people, and served the United Kingdom selflessly and with honour for over six decades.

Our thoughts are with Your Majesty and the Royal Family during this time of mourning.  Yours sincerely Halimah Yacob 10 April 2021 Your Royal Highness, I was saddened to learn of the passing of your father, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. As we mourn his passing, we remember the significant and remarkable life that he had led, dedicated first and foremost to service to the United Kingdom and its people, as well as to the peoples of the Commonwealth and the world at large. He had an indomitable spirit, fighting for peace and justice in the Second World War in his early years, and later steadfastly pursuing environmental causes, where he was well ahead of the times, and taking a close interest in sports and education. His selfless devotion to service has contributed much to advance and uplift the livelihoods of people in the United Kingdom and within the Commonwealth. We will also remember him for his steadfast support of Her Majesty The Queen.  One of his distinguished achievements was the creation of The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme over six decades ago. The awards nurtured and empowered young people to gain the skills, confidence and resilience to become exceptional individuals who can make a difference and contribute to society. The scheme also inspired Singapore’s own National Youth Achievement Award programme, which was launched in 1992. It was clear that the Duke of Edinburgh made education an utmost priority. He visited the National University of Singapore in 1972, and the United World College of Southeast Asia in 1989. He also met students from the Singapore Sports School during Her Majesty The Queen’s State Visit in 2006, where I had the great pleasure to meet him. On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you my deepest condolences and sympathies for this immense loss. He will be remembered and missed. Yours sincerely, Lee Hsien Loong His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland   10 April 2021 Dear Prime Minister Johnson, On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you and your Government my deep condolences on the passing of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Throughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day. We have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh’s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959. The Duke of Edinburgh’s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.

Daily protests demanding the restoration of the elected government have been met with a military crackdown that has left more than 520 civilians dead in the weeks since the February 1 coup.   The junta's violent response has triggered international condemnation -- and threats of retaliation from some of Myanmar's myriad ethnic armed groups. The US State Department said it was ordering the departure of \"non-emergency US government employees and their family members\". The decision was taken to protect the safety and security of staff and their families, the State Department said. World powers have repeatedly condemned the violent crackdown on dissent and hit top junta cadres with sanctions. But the pressure has not swayed the generals. Saturday, the annual Armed Forces Day, saw the biggest loss of life so far, with at least 107 people killed.   The spiralling bloodshed has angered some of Myanmar's 20 or so armed ethnic groups, who control large areas of territory mostly in border regions. Three of them -- the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army and the Arakan Army (AA) -- on Tuesday threatened to join protesters' fight unless the military reined in its crackdown. While the trio has yet to act on their warning, two other outfits -- the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) -- have stepped up attacks on military and police in recent days.   A police station in Bago was reportedly hit with a rocket attack that injured five officers on Tuesday, though it was not clear who was responsible. The KNU, one of the biggest rebel groups, took over an army base in eastern Kayin state at the weekend, prompting the military to respond with air strikes. Further strikes were launched on Tuesday, but Padoh Saw Taw Nee, the KNU's head of foreign affairs, said the group would continue its position of \"strongly supporting people's movement against (the) military coup\". The KNU's Fifth Brigade put out a statement on Tuesday condemning the air strikes and warning it had no option but to \"confront these serious threats\" posed by the military.   Around 3,000 people fled through the jungle to seek safety across the border in Thailand after the weekend strikes. The Thai foreign ministry said late Tuesday about 2,300 have returned to Myanmar, while about 550 remain in Thailand. Karen activists have accused the Thai authorities of pushing people back and accused them of blocking UN refugee officials from the area. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha insisted that there was \"no influx\" of refugees and that the kingdom's authorities had not \"scared them off with guns or sticks\".   Some Karen people injured in the weekend strikes sought medical treatment Tuesday on the Thai side of the border -- the most serious case was a 15-year-old with a collapsed lung and broken rib. Thai police said they had intercepted 10 parcels containing 112 grenades and 6,000 rounds of ammunition in northern Chiang Rai province that had been destined for Myanmar's notorious border town Tachileik. The UN Security Council will hold an emergency session on Myanmar on Wednesday, requested by former colonial power Britain. The 15 members will meet behind closed doors, beginning with a briefing from the UN's special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162735", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18095", "source": "scrapy"},

Activists are determined to overshadow  , using the anniversary to step up their nearly four months of protests pushing for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability. Thousands marched through the streets of Hong Kong island on Tuesday afternoon, despite authorities rejecting an application to hold a rally there as police warned people \"to leave the scene as soon as possible\". Smaller crowds rallied in a number of other districts with clashes quickly breaking out. In Tsuen Wan, masked protesters used umbrellas and sticks to beat riot officers after they made a series of arrests. The officers retreated into a nearby town hall after they came under a barrage of projectiles. In Wong Tai Sin, police fired brief volleys of tear gas against protesters who had blocked nearby roads. The biggest march remained on Hong Kong island, a frequent battlefield between police and protesters where multiple malls and shops remained shuttered for the public holiday. \"Three months on and our five demands have yet to be achieved. We need to continue our fight,\" a protester, wearing a mask from the cult film and comic book \"V for Vendetta\", said. The protests came as lavish celebrations were taking place in Beijing, including a huge military parade through Tiananmen Square under the gaze of China's strongman President Xi Jinping. Among those watching the parade was Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who has historically low approval ratings at home as public anger boils over Beijing's increased control of the semi-autonomous city. Millions have hit the streets in record-breaking numbers while hardcore activists have repeatedly clashed with police, in the biggest challenge to China's rule since the city's 1997 handover by Britain. In a vivid illustration of the political insecurity now coursing through Hong Kong, city officials watched a morning harbourside flag-raising ceremony from the safety of the nearby convention centre. Since the 1997 handover, officials had always attended the ceremony outside, even during torrential downpours. But popular protests that erupted in June have made it increasingly risky for officials to appear in public. A flag-raising ceremony on July 1 -- the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover -- was also watched from indoors as protesters flooded the streets and later laid siege to the city's legislature. Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung delivered an address in which he praised China's development over the last 70 years. But he said officials recognised they needed \"new thinking to try to address deep-rooted problems\" in Hong Kong. Throughout the morning police ramped up security checks and conducted frequent stop and searches while authorities announced the closure of a dozen subway stations. But the measures did little to halt crowds appearing in the afternoon. Rival pro-China rallies were also held. In the morning, a crowd of some 50 people waved flags and chanted \"Long live the motherland!\" \"We are Chinese and the whole nation is celebrating,\" Kitty Chan, 30, told AFP. Hong Kong's protests were initially sparked by a now scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland but have since snowballed into a much wider movement of popular anger against city leaders and Beijing.  Among the demands made by protesters is an inquiry into the police, an amnesty for the more than 1,500 people arrested and universal suffrage -- all of which have been rejected by Beijing and Lam.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/01/111854-untitled-design-7.jpg?itok=C87MYAci\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162737", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22154", "source": "scrapy"},

She added that the announcement is personally \"very meaningful\" to her. Lal came to the US at 18 years old, carrying two suitcases full of books and never imagining she would work at NASA in the future. \"If you can see it, you can believe it,\" she said in a tweet. Returning astronauts to the moon will act as a proving ground before sending them on to Mars, a long-term goal of the Artemis program.  When astronauts explore the lunar south pole, which has never been visited by humans before, they will build on the legacy and science gained during the Apollo program and carry it into a new century.In a statement released by , the proposed spending also calls for an increase of more than 6 percent than the previous year.  \"This USD 24.7 billion funding request demonstrates the Biden Administration's commitment to NASA and its partners who have worked so hard this past year under difficult circumstances and achieved unprecedented success,\" Jurczyk said.  \"The President's discretionary request Strengthens NASA's ability to better understand Earth and how it works as an integrated system, from our oceans to our atmosphere, how it all impacts our daily lives, and how it all is impacted by climate change,\" he added. In addition to aiding the Artemis program and studying climate change, the President's request would also help further the agency's robotic exploration of space, provide a boost to aviation technology and provide new funding for NASA's efforts to engage in STEM outreach for underserved students, according to the agency. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162739", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "33743", "source": "scrapy"},

Speaking to reporters after a closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders on Saturday, Mr Lee said: “I told them that I had concluded that we should prepare to make such a move for nurses because people's attitudes have changed, because in social and work settings, the tudung is now more common. \"And on its own, we can see the merits of allowing ... Muslim nurses to wear the tudung with their uniform if they wish.” He added that the community leaders knew that the Government has been considering allowing Muslim nurses to wear the tudung for “quite some time”, because the Government has been “engaging and consulting them quietly”. But before the change is made, the Government will need to “prepare the ground”, said the Prime Minister. “We have to make sure that everybody understands this is a careful adjustment. Not a wholesale change, and we want people to realise what the limits are, as we make these changes,” Mr Lee added. “And we must make sure that Singaporeans, both Muslims and non-Muslims, are ready to accept the move.” The process will “take a bit of time”, and Mr Lee has asked the community leaders to help the Government with the process over the next few months. “I hope that by the National Day Rally, which will be at the end of August, we should be ready to make a decision, and I shall have something to report,” said the Prime Minister. The closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders was the Prime Minister’s first such dialogue since 2014, when the subject of wearing the tudung was also raised. “Today we had a candid and sincere discussion, focusing more specifically on tudung for nurses. But, of course, going beyond that too,” said Mr Lee. He thanked them for “walking with the Government on this complex journey” and for helping them to manage an important issue. “We are a multiracial and multireligious country. It's a delicate balance, but we are fully committed to preserving our harmony, and to maintaining our common space,” he said. “We want to avoid creating unintended consequences … when we make well intentioned moves.” Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the dialogue was “constructive and candid” and that the community leaders got to hear what the Government’s position and considerations are. He added that there was a common understanding that this issue must be approached carefully because it involves racial and religious sensitivities. \"Therefore, we cannot rush to a decision. At the heart of the matter is how we strike a good balance in allowing our nurses to put on the tudung with their uniform, so that this decision can win the support of all communities, preserve common space and at the same time strengthen our social cohesion,\" he said. He added that in doing so, the Government hoped it can support the request by nurses to don the tudung with their uniform. “We know, we empathise that they want to lead meaningful religious lives daily, because this is also their religious identity,” said Mr Masagos. “Our racial and religious harmony is precious and the Malay Muslim community will safeguard these together with the rest of Singaporeans. We’ll continue to engage Singaporeans on this matter. “I hope to seek everyone's support as we deliberate on this issue, and work towards an outcome that’s acceptable to all Singaporeans.” Mr Masagos added that the Government has “always empathised” with the request by nurses to put on their tudung with their uniform. “But we have to be very careful, because it is not just about the Muslim request alone. Any move, any change in our society must be (carried) very carefully, because it involves interaction with other people,” he added. He said it is a “whole-of-government” approach and that they are reaching out to “every stakeholder” on this issue. Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam in March signalled a likely change in the Government's stance on nurses wearing the tudung, and said they were consulting the community. MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) had raised the issue in Parliament earlier this year. Mr Masagos answered on Mar 8 that the Government would continue to have discussions and consultations with the community behind closed doors. Mufti Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said on Saturday the tudung issue is about balancing the religious needs of communities. \"For example, in this case, the needs of Muslim nurses who choose to put on the tudung, while maintaining a high level of trust and confidence between communities,\" he said. \"So conversations between Government and community leaders and religious leaders are very important for us to consider the full range of perspectives, as well as context for the considerations involved before moving to shift the policy.\" He said it is very important that they “should not make a move that may undermine” Singapore's social cohesion, but instead to continue to strengthen it and \"enlarge our common spaces\". \"I think due to the hard work of our communities in forging greater trust and confidence, we are in a better position now to move on with such a change, and I hope that we will continue to give the support, working together with the relevant agencies to ensure that this policy shift will only result in a stronger and more united society,\" he said. Madam Rahayu Mohamad, a MUIS council member and former president of the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS), said Muslim women who wish to \"observe their religious prescription\" would welcome the move.  \"The women that we actually talked to are educated and they're well informed, and the reason why they are still in these sectors is because they understand and (understand) very well in terms of the decision and the choices that they're making,\" she said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162736", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48108", "source": "scrapy"},

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming  . BHG Holdings also reported a 40 to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods, to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours.   The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners. Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.  From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020. It stands at 10 per cent now.  Property tax rebates passed on by property owners have dried up. Although retail rent is expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.  Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm.

The prime minister after consultations on Friday instructed the Ministry of Commerce and his economic team to immediately take steps to facilitate the relevant sectors, value added, apparel and sugar, by finding alternative cheap sources of import of the needed commodities, the Dawn newspaper quoted sources as saying.   Various proposals have been presented to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) which considers these suggestions from an economic and commercial point of view. After consideration by the ECC, its decisions are presented to the Cabinet for ratification and final approval, the report said. In the present case, a proposal was presented to the ECC to allow the import of cotton, cotton yarn and sugar from India keeping in view domestic requirements, it said. With regards to the ECC decision to allow import of sugar, cotton and cotton yarn from India, Khan held consultations with key members of his Cabinet on Friday and decided that Pakistan could not go ahead with any trade with India under the current circumstances, it said.   The ECC had decided on commercial grounds to recommend these imports for the Cabinet's consideration. While the decision was not on the formal agenda of the Cabinet meeting, the issue was brought up by Cabinet members and the prime minister instructed that the ECC's decision be deferred and immediately reviewed, the report said. The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Khan on Thursday rejected the proposal of the high-powered committee to import cotton from India, with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserting that there can be no normalisation of ties until New Delhi reverses its decision in 2019 to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.   Pakistan's U-turn on Thursday came a day after the ECC, under newly-appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, recommended importing cotton and sugar from India, lifting a nearly two-year-long ban on its import from the neighbouring country amidst tensions over the Kashmir issue. India has said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility, and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility. India has also told Pakistan that talks and terror cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.   The ECC's decision had raised hopes of a partial revival of Pakistan-India bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on the import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. India's move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162739", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17428", "source": "scrapy"},

For Hyderabad-based Sabista Khan, the name is synonymous with both dreams coming true and shoes. Her label ‘The Cinderella Story’ offers a wide variety of jutties not just to go with ethnic Indian clothes, but also quirky ones that go well with western outfits. Many Bollywood actresses, especially Kriti Sanon, Soha Ali Khan, Diana Penty, Manisha Koirala and Rhea Kapoor are quite often been seen sporting the brand. \r\nTalking about her initial days and how she entered the shoe business, Sabista says, “I had moved to Hyderabad from Mumbai in 2015 and was initially interested in designing clothes. But after doing some research I found that there are lots of fashion designers in Hyderabad. I next thought of bringing out belts and bags, before settling for shoes.” \r\nSabista says initially, they were curating and reselling footwear from across the country, bringing them under one label for various pop up exhibitions. “Soon we got a lot of requests for jutties. But we wanted to design our jutties instead of curating them. Reselling didn’t satisfy my creative urge; so then I started researching and travelling to learn about jutties,” she shares.   \r\nSabista was working in corporate communications and as a content writer till 2018, before diving into her business. “I ordered and studied about jutties to understand the issues. Fit was an issue, as some people have broad feet and jutties have a closed front. I wanted everyone to be comfortable wearing our jutties. Comfort first then style. So we treated the leather to not bite,” she explains. From February to April 2019, Sabista did a mock run and went live in April. “Lot of stylists took note of our work and included our footwear in celebrity styling and photo shoots. “Sobhita Dhulipala was the first celebrity to use one of my creations. It was for a teaser shoot of the Made in Heaven web series. I saw the teaser on my television, noticed the footwear and was completely ecstatic. The stylist had not shown me the shoot photos earlier. It was an amazing feeling,” reminiscences Sabista.   \r\nAll said and done, the two-year journey has been a roller coaster ride for Sabista.  The pandemic made 2020 a low period. “We were taking it slow post lockdown too, but social media helped us a lot in promoting our work,” she says. “There was immense personal growth; people took note of our work. It has been an amazing journey,” she adds. Sabista highlights the fact that technology helped her sail through the crisis. Sabista is now diversifying into sliders and mules, perfect for day-to-night look transitions. “The latest collection will have 13 pieces and will go live in May,” she announces.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162739", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16169", "source": "scrapy"},

As we mourn his passing, we remember the significant and remarkable life that he had led, dedicated first and foremost to service to the United Kingdom and its people, as well as to the peoples of the Commonwealth and the world at large. He had an indomitable spirit, fighting for peace and justice in the Second World War in his early years, and later steadfastly pursuing environmental causes, where he was well ahead of the times, and taking a close interest in sports and education. His selfless devotion to service has contributed much to advance and uplift the livelihoods of people in the United Kingdom and within the Commonwealth. We will also remember him for his steadfast support of Her Majesty The Queen.  One of his distinguished achievements was the creation of The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme over six decades ago. The awards nurtured and empowered young people to gain the skills, confidence and resilience to become exceptional individuals who can make a difference and contribute to society. The scheme also inspired Singapore’s own National Youth Achievement Award programme, which was launched in 1992. It was clear that the Duke of Edinburgh made education an utmost priority. He visited the National University of Singapore in 1972, and the United World College of Southeast Asia in 1989.

Throughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day. We have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh’s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959. The Duke of Edinburgh’s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.

The law gives government ministers powers to order social media sites to put warnings next to posts authorities deem to be false, and in extreme cases get them taken down. Facebook, Twitter and Google - who have their Asian headquarters in Singapore - were given temporary exemptions from a handful of provisions in the act to give them time to adapt. If an action is judged to be malicious and damaging to Singapore's interests, companies could be hit with fines of up to $720,000, while individuals could face jail terms of up to 10 years. Authorities in the tightly controlled country - long criticised for restricting civil liberties - insist the measures are necessary to stop the circulation of falsehoods that could sow divisions in society and erode trust in institutions. But the laws have sparked outrage from rights groups, who fear they could stifle online discussion, tech companies and media organisations. Journalist and activist Kirsten Han, who is the Editor-in-Chief of independent media outlet New Naratif, said the legislation was \"extremely worrying\".  \"It’s such a broad law that it's hard to predict how it's going to be applied. What's of immediate concern is the chilling effect and the further entrenchment of self-censorship,\" she told AFP. After the law was passed in May, Google said it was concerned the legislation will \"hurt innovation and the growth of the digital information ecosystem\". A group of nearly 100 academics worldwide also expressed concern over the law, warning earlier this year that it could threaten academic freedom. Activists fear the law could be used to   in the run-up to elections in Singapore, which are expected within months.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2018/09/12/43012-fake%25252520news-20180307084451.jpg?itok=kbz8CawY\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162739", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21206", "source": "scrapy"},

On Tuesday, the Women for Society Association sent a request to City Hall in the capital Phnom Penh to lead a march Friday of  200 participants to Hun Sen’s cabinet office, where the group planned to call for government assistance on rent, debt, utility bills, and the cost of gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak after a year-long economic shutdown of the economy. However, the request was rebuffed, and the group said it would honor the local government’s order. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Since then, five people have died as a result of the disease caused by the virus and restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of the outbreak have decimated the impoverished country’s economy. Speaking to RFA’s Khmer Service on Wednesday, Women for Society Association President Keo Tithlida said that while her group no longer plans to lead a march of supporters to Hun Sen’s cabinet office, she plans to petition the prime minister herself. “City Hall said if we proceed with the march, we will be opposing the law,” she said. “We are not in opposition to the municipal authorities … I am willing to go alone, as long as the petition reaches the [central] government.” While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. By Wednesday, the number of infections had climbed to 1,817. Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association (IDEA) President Vorn Pov told RFA that the government needs to do more to help those in need, echoing several of the Women for Society Association’s demands. “The government should consider providing people daily sustenance, stimulus checks like neighboring countries, free utilities, and intervene in loan debts,” he said. Phnom Penh’s refusal to allow the Women for Society Association to march later this week came as representatives of around 100 scavengers who rely on what they can pick out of the city’s dumpsters told RFA that their hardships have become even more pronounced due to coronavirus restrictions. One scavenger named Bun Mann said that quarantine rules have prevented her children, who recently returned to Cambodia from neighboring Thailand where they labored as migrant workers, from seeking employment back home. “It is very difficult to earn a living during the coronavirus,” she said, adding that she has been forced to take on extra work to support her family. A taxi driver in Siem Reap named Kim Nai told RFA that he had been out of work for a year because no tourists are coming to the area to visit Angkor Wat. He said he had been forced to scavenge, picking up snails and crabs from local rice fields to buy food. “It’s been very quiet, with no tourists,” he said. “Before the coronavirus, I could barely make enough, but now it is even worse. I have no steady income.” Kim Nai said that if he is lucky, he can earn between 5,000 and 10,000 riel (U.S. $1.25 and $2.50) a day, although he often does not have enough rice to eat because he can’t find enough to scavenge. Another taxi driver in Siem Reap named Pok Tho said the decline in tourists also caused him to give up driving. Instead, he said, he now raises chickens and ducks to earn a living. “As someone who relies on tourists, I’ve been left with no income,” he said. “To be honest, if I have enough food in the morning, I won’t have enough in the evening.” Pok Tho said he hopes to find a job in construction but has yet to do so. According to the  , Cambodia Association of Travel Agents (CATA) president Chhay Sivlin said Tuesday that the prolonged pandemic had devastated Cambodia’s tourism industry, warranting government support. Cambodia’s Ministry of Tourism has said that from January to March last year, Cambodia hosted 1.16 million international tourists, a decrease of 38 percent over the same period a year earlier. In the second quarter of 2020, the number of tourists had dropped by 90 percent. Angkor Enterprise, the agency that sells tickets to the Angkor Wat complex, said that slightly more than 400,000 people visited the site over the past two months—a decline of 99 percent from a year ago. Hotel manager Eang Chhal told RFA that around 200 five-star hotels had been forced to close their doors during the pandemic, while several other tourism-related businesses had also been shuttered, but the cost of meat and vegetables is up. Ministry of Tourism recently announced that it will waive fines for tourist businesses that have yet to apply for licenses until the end of the year, after around 30 percent filed for closure or suspension of operations.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/relief-03242021165239.html/cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020-1.jpg/@@images/3628f6f5-207e-414d-8841-4aa8588c5d19.jpeg\" title=\"cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162739", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12570", "source": "scrapy"},

Keo Thithlida, president of the Women for Society Association, and six other youths were held overnight by Stung Meanchey I district police and released next day after putting their thumbprints on a document handed to them by police, Yean Raksa—a member of the association’s board of directors—told RFA on Thursday. “They told me very briefly that they will now suspend their campaign and that they don’t want to talk about it,” Yean Raksa said. “I don’t know if they were simply told to do this or if they were pressured in some way.” “What I can see is that they are afraid,” he said. RFA could not reach the detained youths for comment, but the association later asked local media not to use any information in its reporting not taken from the group’s own Facebook page. “We don’t want to become a political tool,” Yean Raksa said. “We don’t want to see any allegations [made against us] of political motivations or ill will. We are youth with clean hands,” he added. Reached for comment, Phnom Penh Municipality Police spokesperson San Sokseiha declined to discuss the youths’ detention and release, saying he had no information about the case and was too busy to speak. But Ny Sokha, a spokesperson for the Cambodian rights group Adhoc, said the youths had not committed any crime. Forcing people to place their thumbprints on documents in exchange for their release is illegal and a violation of people’s rights, he said. “They were waging a normal [campaign],” he said. “They were seeking support because we live in a democratic world, and they should be allowed to express their views.” Many Cambodians are now struggling to pay their debts and meet the costs of rent, utility bills, and gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 after an already year-long shutdown of the economy.

Cambodia’s Finance Secretary of State Vongsey Visoth told reporters at the ceremony that the government is seeking to buy additional vaccines from India and the U.S. but lauded the country’s special ties to China that had allowed for Friday’s delivery. “The solid steel relationship between Cambodia and China played a vital role in securing vaccine for our country in a timely manner,” he said. While Hun Sen did not take part in the reception ceremony, he posted a comment on his Facebook account saying that Cambodia is in negotiations to purchase around 4 million doses of Sinovac as part of a government push to vaccinate 10 million people, or more than two-thirds of the country’s population. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day after the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Since then, eight people have died as a result of the disease, with the eighth death recorded on Friday. While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. Rollbacks on democracy, including the disbanding of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), that led Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win the country’s election in a landslide in 2018 have led Western nations to increasingly shun Phnom Penh in recent years, while Chinese influence has grown in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation. While Beijing has showered aid on Cambodia, many Cambodians worry about China’s increasing presence in their country’s affairs and have even expressed wariness over the quality of its vaccines. On Friday, political analyst Kim Sok told RFA’s Khmer Service that the Sinovac vaccine doesn’t measure up to vaccines from the West that have earned the recognition of the World Health Organization (WHO). “Hun Sen’s government should have spent money on vaccines recognized by the WHO,” he said. “People have more trust in those vaccines.” Meanwhile, residents living in areas locked down as part of a bid to restrict the spread of the coronavirus in Cambodia urged the government Friday to provide special aid packages to help them during the outbreak. Many Cambodians are now struggling to pay their debts and meet the costs of rent, utility bills, and gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 after an already year-long shutdown of the economy that killed the tourism and entertainment industries. A villager from Siem Reap province named Yim Sogna told RFA that authorities in his district began enforcing the lockdown about a week ago and said he no longer earns an income. He accused the government of failing to address the needs of villagers. “How can we afford the cost of living for a 14-day quarantine,” he asked. “We’ve spent the money we made, but we need to pay the bank too. I call on the government to help the people.” Another villager in the seat of Sihanoukville province, who is also living in a locked down area, told RFA that work had dried up and he is in risk of defaulting on a loan he took to buy a motor taxi, and pay for his rent and utilities. “My situation is getting worse,” he said. “The government must intervene with the banks to suspend loan repayments for a few months.” Ministry of Finance spokesman Meas Soksensan refused to comment when contacted by RFA. Ny Sokha of local rights group Adhoc told RFA that the government needs to not only pay attention to fighting the coronavirus, but also the living standards of the people. He urged the government to release a stimulus package to subsidize those who have lost their incomes. “The government must resolve this posthaste,” he said. On Thursday, the World Bank issued a report which said that more than a year into the pandemic, the economies of East and Asia and the Pacific are facing a “markedly uneven recovery.” According to the Bank, only China and Vietnam are experiencing a V-shaped rebound where output has already surpassed pre-pandemic levels. “In the other major economies, output remained on average around 5 percent below pre-pandemic levels,” the report said. “Economic performance has depended on the effectiveness of virus containment, the ability to take advantage of the revival of international trade, and the capacity of governments to provide fiscal and monetary support.” On Friday, Cambodia’s Finance Ministry spokesman Meas Soksensan told RFA that the government had come to the same conclusion as the Bank, acknowledging that it has been “difficult” for Cambodia’s economy to grow during the pandemic. “The findings are normal because of the impact of the coronavirus,” he said, adding that Cambodia “cannot hope to achieve the same economic growth as before the pandemic.” “I hope that the global economy will recover because some countries have already developed vaccines and are now supplying them to the world.”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162740", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12646", "source": "scrapy"},

The video of DeSantis’ roundtable discussion last month at the state Capitol in Tallahassee was removed on Wednesday because it violated the social media platform’s standards, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said. It had been embedded in a Tampa-area   and it's removal was flagged by the  , a \"free market\" think tank based in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. “YouTube has clear  to support the health and safety of our users,” Hernandez said in a statement. “We removed AIER’s video because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19.” Hernandez said YouTube only allows videos “that otherwise   to remain on the platform if they contain sufficient educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context.” “Our policies apply to everyone and focus on content regardless of the speaker or channel,” Hernandez said. DeSantis's press secretary Cody McCloud called YouTube's move \"another blatant example of Big Tech attempting to silence those who disagree with their woke corporate agenda.\" \"YouTube claimed they removed the video because 'it contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities,' yet this roundtable was led by world-renowned doctors and epidemiologists from Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard, all of whom are eminently qualified to speak on the global health crisis,\" McCloud said. \"Good public health policy should include a variety of scientific and technical expertise, and YouTube’s decision to remove this video suppresses productive dialogue of these complex issues.\" Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, one of the scientists on the panel, said this \"was a policy forum, in which it is appropriate to consider both the benefits and costs of a policy (child masking) when making judgments and recommendations.\" \"YouTube’s censorship of our discussion is contrary to American democratic norms of free expression,\" the professor said in an email. \"It is also a violation of basic standards of scientific conduct, which stand in opposition to unreasoned silencing of contrary views and require the free exchange of ideas.\" Earlier, AIER editorial director Jeffrey A. Tucker insisted  Wednesday on the think tank’s website that YouTube censored DeSantis and the scientists and called it “the latest attack on public health information.” Many public health experts, however, have accused Bhattacharya and the other scientists on the panel with DeSantis — former Trump White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Scott Atlas; epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta; and Dr. Martin Kulldorff — of spreading public health misinformation. NBC News has also reached out to Tucker, Atlas, Gupta and Kulldorff for comment. NBC News did not see the video before it was removed. Tucker first reported its removal. But based on a transcript provided by YouTube, it appears the participants ran afoul of the platform’s standards when DeSantis asked whether children in school should be wearing masks and Kulldorff replied, “Uh, children should not wear face masks, no. They don’t need it for their own protection, and they don’t need it for protecting other people either.” Less than a minute later, Bhattacharya chimed-in, saying that mask-wearing “is developmentally inappropriate and it just doesn’t help on the disease spread.” “There’s no scientific rationale or logic to have children wear masks in school,” Atlas said six minutes later. That language also appears in the   with his article. Those claims run counter to the recommendations of the federal  , which advises that “people age 2 and older should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household.” The  recommendations are a bit looser for younger children, but kids age 12 and over “should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults.” All the scientists in the video but Atlas are signatories to  , which was   and which opposed lockdowns and argued that society would build herd immunity against Covid-19 if all but people over age 70 “resume life as normal.” Atlas, who is  , was especially  to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Many of the world’s leading scientists denounced The Great Barrington Declaration as a “ unsupported by scientific evidence.” And later, then-President Donald Trump’s CDC chief, Dr. Robert Redfield, was overhead by NBC saying of Atlas, “Everything he says is false.” The Trump administration  , as did DeSantis, who was criticized by public health experts for being   and for reopening the state too soon.

It also has the tenth highest Covid-19 infection rate in the country, according to  .

Less than half that number said yes.", "text": "BESSEMER, Ala. — Amazon warehouse workers here voted overwhelmingly against forming a union Friday after a monthslong campaign in which labor had hoped to make inroads into the sprawling company. As of Friday morning, 1,798 employees voted against unionizing, compared to 738 in favor. If it had been approved, the union would have been the first in the United States for Amazon, the country's second-largest employer. Even as the vote was being completed, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, the union seeking to represent the 5,800 workers in Bessemer, said it would challenge the vote by filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. It will allege that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity in the run-up to the election. “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon's behavior in corrupting this election,\" said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU. “Working people deserve better than the way Amazon has conducted itself during this campaign. This campaign has proven that the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is to join together in a union. However, Amazon’s behavior during the election cannot be ignored and our union will seek remedy to each and every improper action Amazon took. We won’t rest until workers' voices are heard fairly under the law.\" Amazon disputed these charges in a blog   after the vote concluded. \"It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,\" the post read. \"Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.\" After the seven-week window to vote by mail ended March 29, the NLRB spent two weeks checking the eligibility of ballots and counting them in a process observed by the union and Amazon. Out of 5,876 eligible voters, 3,041 ballots were cast, but 505 were set aside as contested, mostly by Amazon, according to the union. Ballots can be contested by Amazon or the union based on factors like illegible signatures or questions about whether employees' job titles entitle them to vote. Those ballots are counted only if the final margin is small enough. Labor experts said the results are not a surprise, given the resources Amazon has invested in countering organizing. \"It's so hard for workers to win in a situation like this,\" said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \"The most likely outcome in these situations is that the employer successfully busts the union by instilling fear and uncertainty into the workers, and even those workers that were initially in favor of organizing into a union get afraid and change their mind.\" The Bessemer warehouse, which opened in March 2020, is Amazon's first fulfillment center in Alabama. Workers started organizing toward a union vote in August, hoping it would help improve their working conditions. Currently, it is difficult to go to the bathroom without being penalized, said Jennifer Bates, an Amazon worker in Bessemer, who said she was inspired to support the union effort after regularly having seen her colleagues walk out of work limping from the physical toll the job takes. At the start of this year, Amazon launched what labor experts characterized as a classic, well-funded anti-union campaign at the warehouse. Workers said they were required to attend multiple meetings during their shifts, in which Amazon representatives explained why a union was not, in their view, beneficial for workers. Posters all over the warehouse, some of them in bathroom stalls, encouraged workers to vote no. The company also distributed buttons and stickers for employees to wear, and it created a website and a hashtag, #DoItWithoutDues, highlighting how workers might have to pay $500 in annual dues to the union. Amazon has a  . In 1999, the Communication Workers of America started a campaign to unionize 400 customer service employees in Seattle. After months of anti-union campaigning, Amazon closed down the call center in 2000 in what the company said was a restructuring related to the dot-com bust. In 2014, 21 equipment technicians at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware   following what the union spokesman described as \"intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants.\" Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako   at the time that the \"no\" vote against third-party representation showed that employees \"prefer a direct connection with Amazon.\" Workers in Bessemer who opposed the union seemed to question its purpose. LaVonette Stokes, who works as a labor organizer for the Alabama teachers union when she's not working at Amazon, and her husband are have positions as mid-level process guides that earn $15 to $19 an hour. But she said that a union for unskilled labor in Bessemer makes no sense and that it would move too slowly. She and her husband spent $2,400 of their own money to print flyers that detailed Amazon's benefits. \"We're talking about a union that has made contracts where, yes, they got a raise, but it took them about five to seven years before they even got to that raise,\" she said. Her husband, William, said: \"We're not against unions. We're against this particular union, and we're against a union at this particular facility. Everything that this union is offering, we can do ourselves.\" Workers in favor of the union said they had hoped it would help improve their working conditions, providing better job security and benefits when Amazon is   in part because of a pandemic-induced boom in online retail. \"I like my job. I give it 110 percent every day I go in there, regardless how hard it is, how stressful it is,\" said Darryl Richardson, a worker at the Bessemer warehouse. \"But I feel like employees deserve better and more for what they do.\" Richardson said he and other pro-union workers expect to be fired or forced to quit their jobs. \"I have to move on, and I hate it,\" he said. \"It's sad that you do everything you can to try to make things better for the people and you feel like you are going to lose your job.\" Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, said in an email, \"We respect all our employees' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment.\" Amazon spokesperson Leah Seay said that in Bessemer receive health care coverage and hourly pay of at least $15.30, which is well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Alabama has no minimum wage law. Employees also get a retirement plan, Seay said. Despite the ultimate vote against unionizing, the drive attracted global attention to conditions for Amazon's warehouse workers and the  , said Givan, the Rutgers professor. \"Workers around the country who have been watching what's happening will be potentially inspired by what can happen if you do take action and get national attention,\" she said. It also drew attention from other unions. Following the results, Randy Korgan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Director for Amazon praised workers' attempts to unionize. “Despite going up against one of the world’s richest men in a country with weak labor laws, the workers in Bessemer brought national attention to issues that many non-union workers face in this industry,\" said Korgan. \"This fight is not over, and the Teamsters will always support workers who want to build power by standing together and demanding dignity, a safe workplace, and a fair return on their work.” Analysts said efforts to unionize at other Amazon warehouses in the U.S. are likely to continue, particularly in higher-cost states like New York and California. RWDSU spokesperson Chelsea Connor said the union received over a thousand inquiries about organizing from Amazon workers at other facilities since the organizing effort began. \"Amazon is already about the best-paying job a non-skilled laborer can get in Alabama,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"But in higher-costs states, it's barely a living wage. \"It will cut into profits,\" he said. \"But it's a humane thing to do.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202104/1617986891265_ott_now_amazon_210409_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162745", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.wionews.com", "section": "WORLD", "sub_section": "Central Asia", "article_url": "https://www.wionews.com/world/britons-lose-ps18-million-as-cyber-conning-becomes-rampant-in-the-country-292068", "title": "Britons lose £1.8 million as cyber-conning becomes rampant in the country", "author": "Edited By:     ", "author_link": "", "published_date": "    New Delhi, India\n    ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "She claimed that crime in the country has fallen by 21 per cent", "text": "The United Kingdom is one of the hardest-hit countries by the COVID-19 pandemic.

I’m 23 weeks pregnant, and my world has just been shattered. They call on us and escort us back to a waiting suite just for us. This might be the hardest day of our lives, but at least we’ll get to cry in peace. I see a plaque next to the window that overlooks the city. “The Window of Hope” was donated by a family that is now welcoming us into a club that we want nothing to do with.  I’m called to my first appointment of the day, an MRI of my abdomen that will take about an hour. Because of the pandemic, I’ll have to go alone. I’m in a giant metal tube that sounds like a construction site. A movie is on in the background to distract from the noise of the machine. It’s a movie I’ve seen many times, but it feels completely foreign and I just stare.  The tech gently tells me, “this next image we’ll need to take with you staying completely still.”  “Ok.” I think I say it out loud, but I’m not sure.  A recorded voice plays, “take a deep breath in ... now out ... now hold ...” and I do. I am a statue ― no breathing, no moving. I think maybe if I’m still enough, they’ll be able to see the part of my baby’s brain that they say is missing. Maybe if I’m still enough, they’ll run in and say, “We were wrong! Everything is fine! Finish planning your baby shower!” But they don’t. The rest of the day is littered with cameras and wires and dark rooms with bright screens. It’s invasive and uncomfortable and there’s an unspoken tension in the air. Something’s wrong, but we have to wait for the big reveal at the end of the day to find out exactly how wrong it is. We put on a movie in our waiting room and I fall asleep.  Then, it’s showtime. We walk slowly to a socially distanced conference room. A team of very smart doctors and specialists — thankfully, all of them women — explain what they know and predict what they can.  I hear snippets of what they say, phrases like: “Structure of the brain is missing” “Fluid in the ventricles”  “More than one anomaly can mean genetic disorder” “Lifelong impairment” “70% chance of this ... 45% chance of this ...” “There’s just no way to know...”  I oscillate between sobs and asking questions and then sit in silence waiting for them to tell me what to do ... until I realize that they aren’t going to. Seeing the anguish and confusion on our faces, one of the doctors asks if we want to chat alone. She explains the process of termination and what we can expect. Then she gives me the advice that makes it OK to move forward. She says, “Think about it, go over it, talk about it and make a decision. Once you’ve made the decision and it’s final, then don’t go back. Don’t try to renegotiate the past. Decide and never look back.” So we did.  The next day, we’re in a different hospital. It’s hard to navigate and far too crowded for a pandemic. We stand in a taped circle on the floor. Someone asks if I would like to take their seat and smiles at my pregnant belly. I start crying.  We’re called back to a tiny room and I lie down on the table just like it’s another sonogram. A doctor and his assistant can’t seem to look me in the face, or maybe that’s just how it feels. We are all deeply reverent of the grim reality of what’s about to take place. I see a giant needle and bury my face into my husband’s chest and we cry. And just like that, it’s done. His heart stops instantly.  That was the saddest moment of my life ― I can pinpoint it and still feel it. I can see what I was wearing and hear the machines beeping. It feels like part of me never left that room.  It took two days in the hospital to deliver. The doctors and nurses were incredible. I will never forget the understanding and compassionate care I received from those amazing humans. Every day we live with the decision we made, one that was reached only after experiencing unimaginable grief and making desperate phone calls, research and consulting with experts, and crying with our parents. In the end, I thought about what I would choose if it were me and I can confidently say that I would not choose a life of suffering for myself, so I would not willingly inflict it on someone else. I have no regret and would make the same decision if I had to do it over.   And, while my story is harrowing, I feel it’s important to point out that  . Yes, my choice was devastating, but at least there was a pretty clear path forward for me. The same cannot be said for many other women who are considering an abortion. Often, their decision is complicated by factors outside of their control. I was very lucky to be living in a state where the abortion laws work to empower women instead of seeking to deceive, deflect and deprive. Many women do not. But abortions don’t stop when access is restricted, and with fewer providers comes longer waits, which force women to continue with a pregnancy they are trying to end as early as possible.  In some states, a woman must have an invasive transvaginal ultrasound, then wait days before she can obtain an abortion, increasing the risk to her health.   to eventually ban abortion with no exceptions for incest, rape, or even if the mother’s life is in danger. Politicians in   and   have attempted to enact laws making the act of obtaining an abortion punishable by death. These measures aren’t pro-life, they are anti-woman. It’s not about saving life ― it’s about control.  In the end, it was my choice. It was a decision made between me and my husband and my doctors, and if anyone not personally involved thinks they or a politician on a moral soapbox deserves a place in the conversation, they are profoundly mistaken. If anyone thinks it is easy or fun to make this kind of unthinkable decision or that it’s made hastily, they are wrong. Still, regardless of why someone goes through what I just went through ― even if it’s for a reason that we do not understand or agree with — they should have the choice. They should have the right.", "image_url": "<img class=\"image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6064e379270000cf32c84d4f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" alt=\"The author and her husband are still navigating the tangle of emotions, but they were able to dig this frame out of a box and\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162747", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "61630", "source": "scrapy"},

In its annual Cambodian Journalism Situation Report, CamboJA said it recorded 35 cases of harassment against 72 journalists in 2020, based on news reports, social media posts, court documents and interviews, and that more than 42 of them were detained for questioning or imprisoned. At least 22 journalists were either attacked or threatened with violence while working, the group said, and one journalist died in what police concluded was a traffic accident without carrying out what it termed a “proper investigation.” According to CamboJA, Cambodian authorities continued to use the threat of legal action to intimidate journalists in 2020, particularly the charges of “incitement to commit felony” or “extortion” under Articles 495 and 232 of the Criminal Code.  As of December, at least 10 journalists remain in prison in the country, eight of whom are in pre-trial detention for criminal charges, it said. “The ongoing imprisonment, detention and physical threats against journalists undermines the media’s role in a democratic society and strikes fear in those who cover stories or cases involving powerful officials,” CamboJA said in its report. “Journalists have generally been unsuccessful when turning to the courts for justice or protection, even when they are able to identify perpetrators such as military police, district security guards, timber traders and cock fighters. This impunity for crimes against journalists compounds the sense of fear and futility for those seeking to expose bad actors inside and outside of government.” Speaking to RFA’s Khmer Service, CamboJA executive director Nop Vy said that in addition to the threat of harassment and arrest, journalists also lack any support from relevant authorities. He also called the overall situation of press freedom in Cambodia in 2020 significantly worse than in previous years. “Pending cases involving journalists related to ethics and their profession as journalists should be dropped,” he said. “Stop filing lawsuits against them because all these cases create an environment of fear that impacts press freedom.” Ministry of Information Meas Sophorn responded to the claims in the report by saying that journalists in Cambodia “enjoy freedom of the press” and suggesting that certain NGOs were “not reporting the truth” about the situation. “In accordance with the law, they can fulfill the requirements of their profession freely and fully in the Kingdom of Cambodia,” he told RFA “There are many journalists working in the profession, and the number is increasing. However, journalists working in Cambodia are held accountable. If a journalist commits a crime, he must be held accountable before the law.” Media director of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media (CCIM), Ith Sothoeut, told RFA that when authorities use the criminal code to arrest journalists it forces them to self-censor. Ith Sothoeut called on the authorities to apply the country’s Press Law in support of journalists who report on the shortcomings of powerful officials and other problems in society. “As CambodJa mentioned in its report, so far, the Press Law has not been enforced in nearly all cases involving journalists,” he said. “On the contrary, the criminal code has been applied, which is unfortunate for journalists.” Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin—who had worked as an editor, reporter and news anchor, and a photographer and videographer for RFA’s Khmer Service, respectively—were taken into custody in November 2017. They remain out on bail but in legal limbo after a series of appeals have been rejected by courts. They were charged with “illegally collecting information for a foreign source” after RFA closed its bureau in the capital in September that year and were slapped with additional charges for illegally produced pornography in March 2018. If convicted of the first charge, they could face a jail term of between seven and 15 years. Paris-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Cambodia 144  out of 180 nations in its 2020 World Press Freedom Index, down from 143  a year earlier, citing a crackdown on independent media in the lead up to the country’s 2018 general election. The crackdown on the independent media came amid a wider attack by Prime Minister Hun Sen on the political opposition and NGOs that paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats up for grab in the ballot.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162744", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12106", "source": "scrapy"},

Speaking to reporters after a closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders on Saturday, Mr Lee said: “I told them that I had concluded that we should prepare to make such a move for nurses because people's attitudes have changed, because in social and work settings, the tudung is now more common. \"And on its own, we can see the merits of allowing ... Muslim nurses to wear the tudung with their uniform if they wish.” He added that the community leaders knew that the Government has been considering allowing Muslim nurses to wear the tudung for “quite some time”, because the Government has been “engaging and consulting them quietly”. But before the change is made, the Government will need to “prepare the ground”, said the Prime Minister. “We have to make sure that everybody understands this is a careful adjustment. Not a wholesale change, and we want people to realise what the limits are, as we make these changes,” Mr Lee added. “And we must make sure that Singaporeans, both Muslims and non-Muslims, are ready to accept the move.” The process will “take a bit of time”, and Mr Lee has asked the community leaders to help the Government with the process over the next few months. “I hope that by the National Day Rally, which will be at the end of August, we should be ready to make a decision, and I shall have something to report,” said the Prime Minister. The closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders was the Prime Minister’s first such dialogue since 2014, when the subject of wearing the tudung was also raised. “Today we had a candid and sincere discussion, focusing more specifically on tudung for nurses. But, of course, going beyond that too,” said Mr Lee. He thanked them for “walking with the Government on this complex journey” and for helping them to manage an important issue. “We are a multiracial and multireligious country. It's a delicate balance, but we are fully committed to preserving our harmony, and to maintaining our common space,” he said. “We want to avoid creating unintended consequences … when we make well intentioned moves.” Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the dialogue was “constructive and candid” and that the community leaders got to hear what the Government’s position and considerations are. He added that there was a common understanding that this issue must be approached carefully because it involves racial and religious sensitivities. \"Therefore, we cannot rush to a decision. At the heart of the matter is how we strike a good balance in allowing our nurses to put on the tudung with their uniform, so that this decision can win the support of all communities, preserve common space and at the same time strengthen our social cohesion,\" he said. He added that in doing so, the Government hoped it can support the request by nurses to don the tudung with their uniform. “We know, we empathise that they want to lead meaningful religious lives daily, because this is also their religious identity,” said Mr Masagos. “Our racial and religious harmony is precious and the Malay Muslim community will safeguard these together with the rest of Singaporeans. We’ll continue to engage Singaporeans on this matter. “I hope to seek everyone's support as we deliberate on this issue, and work towards an outcome that’s acceptable to all Singaporeans.” Mr Masagos added that the Government has “always empathised” with the request by nurses to put on their tudung with their uniform. “But we have to be very careful, because it is not just about the Muslim request alone. Any move, any change in our society must be (carried) very carefully, because it involves interaction with other people,” he added. He said it is a “whole-of-government” approach and that they are reaching out to “every stakeholder” on this issue. Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam in March signalled a likely change in the Government's stance on nurses wearing the tudung, and said they were consulting the community. MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) had raised the issue in Parliament earlier this year. Mr Masagos answered on Mar 8 that the Government would continue to have discussions and consultations with the community behind closed doors. Mufti Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said on Saturday the tudung issue is about balancing the religious needs of communities. \"For example, in this case, the needs of Muslim nurses who choose to put on the tudung, while maintaining a high level of trust and confidence between communities,\" he said. \"So conversations between Government and community leaders and religious leaders are very important for us to consider the full range of perspectives, as well as context for the considerations involved before moving to shift the policy.\" He said it is very important that they “should not make a move that may undermine” Singapore's social cohesion, but instead to continue to strengthen it and \"enlarge our common spaces\". \"I think due to the hard work of our communities in forging greater trust and confidence, we are in a better position now to move on with such a change, and I hope that we will continue to give the support, working together with the relevant agencies to ensure that this policy shift will only result in a stronger and more united society,\" he said. Madam Rahayu Mohamad, a MUIS council member and former president of the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS), said Muslim women who wish to \"observe their religious prescription\" would welcome the move.  \"The women that we actually talked to are educated and they're well informed, and the reason why they are still in these sectors is because they understand and (understand) very well in terms of the decision and the choices that they're making,\" she said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162740", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48108", "source": "scrapy"},

White House press secretary Jen Psaki has fielded frequent questions on whether Harris' role includes addressing the current situation on the southern border, while aides to the vice president have quickly shot down suggestions that Harris is focused on anything other than tackling the   in Mexico and the \"Northern Triangle\" countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. \"The Northern Triangle, which I’m sure you’re aware of,\" Psaki said Wednesday, \"is not the same as the border.\" The confusion clouding Harris' first big policy assignment underscores the challenges Harris faces as she seeks to define her role inside the Biden White House. It also raises questions as to why the White House did not do more at the outset to clearly establish and communicate the shape of her new policy role. Since the announcement, aides say Harris has been focused on behind-the-scenes work, reading up on the issues and attending meetings with experts. She has held calls with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss migration and has discussed planning a trip to the region, something aides say she hopes to do soon. But publicly, her focus has appeared to be elsewhere. On Monday, Harris  , to highlight the administration's new  . She made another trip on Tuesday to  , where she toured a vaccination site. She joined Biden on Wednesday for a speech about the jobs plan, spoke about the administration's steps to combat gun violence on Thursday and attended an economic briefing in the Oval Office on Friday. Harris did not hold any public events this past week related to migration and declined to take questions from the reporters traveling with her on her trips outside of Washington. \"This is a priority for her. But it's also a priority for her to get the jobs plan passed and it's a priority for her to talk to people about getting vaccinated,\" a White House official said. \"You can do many things at once.\" When asked in an interview Wednesday with   about when the public could expect to hear from the vice president on migration issues, Psaki said only that she expected \"people will hear from her soon.\" White House aides have expressed some frustration with the situation, saying reporters were too willing to conflate the root causes of migration with the situation at the border, leading to initial confusion when Harris' role was first announced. Harris' role, aides point out, was advertised as a diplomatic mission from the start. \"I actually think that members of the media deserve to have an understanding of what her exact role was,\" Psaki said when asked why the White House felt a need to clarify Harris' assignment on numerous occasions. Still, the White House's messaging has at times added to the confusion. In a statement Friday announcing that  , Biden's border czar who has played a key role in the Northern Triangle, would be stepping down, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the vice president would continue \"overseeing a whole-of-government approach,\" appearing to contradict the narrow scope of her role that officials had been insisting on all week. A senior administration official later said the vice president's role was not expanding in any way and that Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra would continue to spearhead the administration's response to the border. Some White House officials have also argued that part of the confusion around Harris' role is rooted in the challenge of explaining to the American public the various reasons why people are seeking asylum — ranging from   to   and poverty — especially after   spent his time in office demonizing migrants arriving at the southern border. But Republicans have been quick to tie Harris directly to events on the border. Republican National Committee spokesperson Keith Schipper has described Harris as the \"manager of the Biden border crisis,\" while   \"Where's Kamala? Biden's border point person can't be bothered to show up.\" Some Democrats worry the assignment could be politically perilous for Harris, especially as she considers a potential second run for president, but giving a more polarizing task to the vice president is not unusual. Biden was handed a similar role when he was vice president ahead of the 2014 midterms, which saw   become a key issue after a similar border surge. Biden continued to work on the issue through the end of his term, making regular phone calls to leaders in the region and visiting the area on multiple trips. \"I spend so much time in matters relating to this area, my constituents are beginning to think that maybe I should run for office here,\" Biden joked on a 2016 trip to Guatemala. As to when Harris will make her first trip to the Northern Triangle, a White House official said their team was working on planning the journey but added, \"We are also being mindful that we just announced the American Jobs Plan and we're doing multiple things at one time.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3463241/210408-kamala-harris-ac-814p_3d8403f39949fe2fc2021ba4364aaf8d.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: President Biden And Vice President Harris Meet With Cabinet Members And Immigration Advisors\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162747", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Finding her allegations “completely false, provocative and intemperate” statements, the EC said Ms Banerjee’s attacks and “attempts to berate and vilify the Central paramilitary forces during the electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation among the rank and file of these forces, who have been rendering yeoman’s service since the late 1980s in election after election….”   It also noted that the two-time CM “has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central paramilitary forces… Far more discouraging is the fact that Ms Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other. In fact, Ms Banerjee is sparing no efforts to ensure that a deep wedge and drift is created amongst them which is bound to have serious consequential damage even after the process of elections is over.”   Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in the city on Friday for the poll campaign, tore into the TMC chief over her all-out criticism of the Central forces and the accusations against him.

The government issued a sub-decree on Wednesday suspending all “unnecessary” business, gatherings, and travel between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. until April 14 to prevent further transmission of an outbreak that has seen 21 people who had tested positive for COVID-19—the disease caused by the coronavirus—die since February. The decree includes exceptions that allow people to buy food, get tested for COVID-19, get vaccinated against the coronavirus, receive medical treatment, or attend to a family member who is “seriously ill” or has died. Phnom Penh governor Khuong Sreng told RFA’s Khmer Service that employees who work night shifts must have an official certificate confirming their working hours and must always carry a company identification card to show to authorities. “Companies must issue official permission letters to their staff,” he told RFA’s Khmer Service. “Businesspeople who need to travel to places such as hotels must return to their homes at night with a certificate confirming that they have the right to do so.” Khuong Sreng added that all companies are responsible for their employees’ actions and could face legal action, including fines or license suspension, if they are found to be in violation of the curfew. “The head of the institution is responsible in case staffers leave work and go drinking, which will cause disorder and does not comply with the curfew ordered by City Hall,” he said. “If we investigate and find out that this is truly a problem, it may lead to fines or the closure of companies.” Members of the public who require travel during the curfew must inform their commune chief or local authorities in advance, Khoung Sreng said. Law enforcement has been ordered to confiscate the vehicles of people who disobey the curfew and place them in 14-day quarantine at their homes, he added. The Ministry of Health confirmed two COVID-19-related deaths on Thursday, bringing the country’s official count to 16 since early March and weeks after the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the coronavirus a global pandemic. Five other people who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 have died over the same period, although the government claims their deaths were the result of complications from pre-existing health conditions. The ministry also announced 37 new COVID-19 infections Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 2,477. While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record late last month of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to nearly triple that of when the latest outbreak was first detected in February. Human rights groups expressed concern over the curfew Thursday, saying the measure was “unrealistic” for people who need to leave their homes at night in case of emergency. Am Sam Ath, deputy director of human rights for local group Licadho, called on the government to allow certain exceptions for the curfew. “Regarding people with urgent needs, it will be difficult to inform the authorities or their commune chief and receive permission to leave home, especially in the middle of the night,” he said. “There need to be exceptions in the case of an emergency related to health or family problems.” Residents living in areas of Cambodia locked down as part of a bid to restrict the spread of the coronavirus have urged the government to provide special aid packages to help them during the outbreak.

The Cambodian Youth Network (CYN) said in a news release that it had undertaken a 55-kilometer (34-mile) patrol of the Preah Roka Wildlife Sanctuary in the Preah Vihear province districts of Choam Ksan, Tbeng Meanchey, and Cheb from March 19-21, during which it recorded the 100 cases, mostly of rare and priceless timber. The logging included trees with cross-sections ranging from 45 centimeters (18 inches) to 1.5 meters (five feet) in areas of dense and semi-dense forest, and species such as Teal, Steang, Phteak, Popeal, Pechek, Odom, Korki, and Sokrom, the group said. In addition to targeting individual trees, perpetrators also burned and cleared certain areas of the forest, it said. Ma Chetra, a senior media official with the CYN, called the forest crimes “recent,” but said those responsible had yet to be identified. He expressed concern for the sanctuary because the Ministry of Environment has prevented his group from carrying out patrols, which is when the forest crimes took place. “When [the Ministry of Environment] stopped us, it was of no benefit to the ministry,” he told RFA’s Khmer Service. “There is no loss in letting us patrol the forest, but it is the nation that will lose by banning us from entering the forest because trees in protected areas are being cut down.” Ma Chetra urged the government to do a better job of policing the sanctuary and other protected areas in Cambodia. “Even if we or the Ministry of Environment patrol the forest from time to time, it won’t be enough to stop deforestation,” he said. “The only way to end the deforestation is to strictly enforce the law against perpetrators or those behind the crimes. If we want forest crimes to be prevented in Cambodia, the authorities must apply the law to those who trade in the trees.” Ministry of Environment spokesman Neth Peaktra refused to respond to the findings of the CYN, calling the group “not a lawful cooperative partner” with the ministry. He acknowledged that forest crimes do take place but called them small in number. Neth Peaktra added that any group is welcome to enter the forest, provided that it registers with the ministry ahead of time. Preah Roka Wildlife Sanctuary was designated by the Ministry of Environment as a 96,000-hectare (237,220-acre) conservation forest in 2016. Environmental activists say that the sanctuary has been subject to illegal logging operations for years, but that authorities have failed to take effective measures to prevent its destruction. CYN called on the Ministry of Environment to end restrictions on local communities, forest activists, associations, civil society organizations and the public from participating in patrolling, protecting, conserving and maintaining the forest, in accordance with the provisions on the rights and duties of citizens, as specified in Cambodia’s constitution and the Law on Protection of Nature. CYN’s call to action followed the March 26 release of a new report by the Geneva-based G​l​ob​a​l​ ​Initiative ​Against​ ​Trans​national​ ​Organize​d​ ​Crime, which found that Cambodia lost nearly 600,000 hectares (1.5 million acres), or nearly 12 percent, of forest coverage in the country’s protected areas between 2011 and 2018. The group said that such deforestation disproportionately impacts indigenous communities that rely on the collection of non-timber forest products. Thousands of trees were illegally destroyed in Preah Roka Wildlife Sanctuary and Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary in Kratie province and processed for export during the period, according to the report, which also found that deforestation in Cambodia had continued at an all-time high for the past decade. The deforestation is a result of Cambodia’s government investing in economic land concessions for private companies, granting social land concessions, and “re-forestation projects,” which the G​l​ob​a​l​ ​Initiative ​Against​ ​Trans​national​ ​Organize​d​ ​Crime said are granted to investors who typically convert land into profitable monoculture plantations that destroy the ecology of forests and impact local populations. Forest protection activist San Mala told RFA that the report shows the government must strengthen its protection of the country’s remaining forest and said economic land concessions adjacent to protected forests are often responsible for deforestation. “The government should accept the report to study, research and re-evaluate past projects to determine their positive and negative aspects,” he said. “What should be improved or strengthened, or what it should keep implementing.” Ministry of Environment spokesman Neth Pheaktra told RFA via social media that his ministry would not comment on the report. He said the ministry will continue to “enforce the law” and implement action plans in collaboration with community partners in protected areas for the purpose of protecting and conserving forest resources and wildlife. The G​l​ob​a​l​ ​Initiative ​Against​ ​Trans​national​ ​Organize​d​ ​Crime is a network of more than 500 experts from around the world who jointly researched the deforestation situation in Cambodia between 2018 and 2020. The experts documented their findings by visiting the sites for several weeks at a time, during which they met with locals and loggers to locate illegal logging. They use GPS and smartphones to record illegal logging activities, as well as drones to document large-scale logging in protected forests. The two forestry reports came as civil society groups and indigenous Phnong villagers criticized the Mondulkiri provincial court Friday for granting bail to military officer Touch Hoeun, who is accused of being the ringleader of a group of people who destroyed 53 hectares (131 acres) of indigenous Pou Treng village community forest last week. An indigenous villager named Kroeung Tola told RFA that Touch Hoeun is regularly involved in the destruction of community and public forests. He said his community has enough evidence and documentation to prove Touch Hoeun committed the crime, and that the court’s decision was unjust. “Touch Hoeun has been involved in many scandals in the province,” he said. Last week, more than 40 villagers stopped Touch Hoeun’s tractors from destroying the community forest and local authorities arrested him for allegedly faking documents granting him permission to raze the land. RFA was unable to reach provincial prosecutor Morm Vanda or Touch Hoeun for comment on Friday. However, court spokesman Meas Bros told RFA that the public is welcome to appeal the decision. “Please refer questions to the judge, because there must be a reason for his release,” he said. Pen Bunna, senior land and natural resources officer for local rights group Adhoc also criticized the court’s decision calling it a “double standard.” “This is a culture of impunity,” he said, adding that the court is regularly quick to punish the poor, but often delays cases against the wealthy and well-connected.

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming  . BHG Holdings also reported a 40 to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods, to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours.   The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners. Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.  From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020. It stands at 10 per cent now.  Property tax rebates passed on by property owners have dried up. Although retail rent is expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.  Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm. Perhaps it also knows not keeping up risks losing loyal customers to competing malls.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/9068518/1957a42a2a1da80ba693669103d71585/sing-tien-foo-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Sing Tien Foo \">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162747", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "49262", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162747", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "54751", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.thehindu.com", "section": "News", "sub_section": "International News ", "article_url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explainer-what-is-behind-the-latest-unrest-in-northern-ireland/article34289004.ece", "title": "\nExplainer | What is behind the latest unrest in Northern Ireland?\n", "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Police form a line to separate Nationalists from attacking each other in North Belfast, Northern Ireland on April 9, 2021.   | Photo Credit:", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162725", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer   on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said.   The US Navy said it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state.   The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.”   The MEA added: “The   was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile, the US Seventh Fleet said: “  (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”   It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162747", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17678", "source": "scrapy"},

In a statement made at the 46  Session of the Human Rights Council on Wednesday, Cambodia Ambassador and Permanent Representative Sokkhoeurn An said that his country had accepted six Special Rapporteurs over the last three decades, proving its open engagement with the agency and processs, but that “cooperation is a two-way process.” He said that Special Procedure Mandate Holders (SPMHs) are expected to perform their duties “in an objective, impartial, non-selective and non-politicized manner,” and suggested that experts should adhere to their code of conduct by “establishing facts duly cross-checked.” Sokkhoeurn An also urged SPMHs to assist states in the field of human rights “through genuine dialogues and cooperation with non-judicial character of the reports and conclusion, bearing in mind the national particularities of each country.” Lastly, the representative said that SPMHs should provide advice on requested technical cooperation and capacity building assistance “with a view to addressing the underlying conditions rather than attending only to the symptoms.” “To conclude, only with due diligence to the said protocols will the SPMHs earn trust from the states,” he said. Sokkhoeurn An’s statement follows the recent appointment by the U.N. Human Rights Council of Thailand’s Vitit Muntarbhorn to the role of Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Cambodia, following the end of a five-year mandate by his predecessor Rhona Smith in January. Muntarbhorn, an international law professor, had previously served as the first U.N. Independent Expert on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity for the Human Rights Council. Smith’s tenure as Special Rapporteur was marked by frequent sparring with Cambodia’s government over issues related to the September 2017 arrest of opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) President Kem Sokha for “treason” and the disbanding of his party for its role in the alleged plot two months later. The move to dissolve the CNRP marked the beginning of a wider crackdown by Hun Sen on the political opposition, NGOs, and the independent media that paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in the country’s July 2018 general election. In November, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court summoned at least 113 individuals connected to the CNRP to stand trial together, most of whom face charges of conspiracy and incitement to sow chaos in society—crimes punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The prospect of a rapid mass trial of the opposition prompted Smith to express serious concerns in a statement ahead of the proceedings, which she said appeared to be “politically motivated, lacking clear legal grounds and constitute a serious violation of the due process rights, firmly established by international human rights law.” Underscoring the difficulties the new U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights will face in Phnom Penh, the Siem Reap Provincial Court jailed three more CNRP activists Thursday to five years in prison over a “conspiracy to topple the government” after they spoke out against Hun Sen’s government. One of the three, an activist named Chhun Vean who is currently seeking asylum in neighboring Thailand, dismissed the verdict as “laughable” in an interview with RFA’s Khmer Service. “It proves that the court is a tool of the Phnom Penh regime to persecute the opposition party,” he said. Chhun Vean said that the sentence would only motivate him to work harder to “bring democracy to Cambodia.” Sam Sokong, a lawyer representing the three activists, told RFA that his clients were innocent of the crime they were charged with and were only expressing their personal opinions, as is their right under Cambodia’s constitution. He vowed to appeal the verdict.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162747", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11935", "source": "scrapy"},

Johnson & Johnson will be delivering fewer vaccine doses next week, but Zients did not say how many although he insisted the company expects to be able to deliver 8 million doses per week by the end of April.

The J&J shot was expected to significantly boost the pace at which Americans become fully vaccinated because it requires only a single shot. While the pharma giant is based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the vaccines are manufactured in Baltimore. Emergent BioSolutions has also been making the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines. But up to 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine were ruined when Emergent BioSolutions workers mixed up the ingredients of the two vaccines. And a week ago   that a batch of its key vaccine ingredient didn't meet quality control standards at a Baltimore facility. Zients said from now on, only the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be manufactured at that plant. Last week, two Biden administration officials assured NBC News that this setback would not affect their timeline to have enough doses for the U.S. adult population by the end of May.

However, if this law were to pass, people who have changed their gender and or any desire to do so will not be able to avail such facilities. \r\n \r\nViktor Orban, the Hungarian Prime Minister recently faced flak for introducing a law allowing him to rule by decree - indefinitely. All this happened in the midst of a pandemic, denying the world an opportunity to react. It’s important to note here how protesting - the most vocal and effective way to change the route of any legislation remains disallowed across the globe owing to social distancing norms in place, as coronavirus is transmitted from human-to-human. An independent member of parliament Bernadett Szel openly referred to the law as “evil” and a “step back in time”. Szel attempted to shed light on the discriminatory nature of the law in the parliament but was shut down. “We have a pandemic going on and all of us should be focusing on two things: healthcare issues and helping people financially to secure their wellbeing. What is happening in Hungary is a scandal,” she added during the hearing. Even though there is no clarity on when exactly the bill will be passed, it looks like the government is pursuing it, considering its passage through committees. There’s another issue with the law - it could stir problem whose gender on paper is different from their sex at birth. Their identities remain threatened under this legislation.

The hardest hit continent - Europe has largely remained under lockdown over the last few weeks. However, as the recovery rate starts to improve and the number of infections continue to drop, people are sneaking out and about. Spain has a loophole in its lockdown rules: people with pets may leave their homes to walk their pets. However, not everybody is walking their pets. With no clear dictation of what encapsulates pets, people have taken full liberty. Just on Friday, the Spanish National Police shared an image on Twitter whereby a man was fined for walking an unusual pet… a fish in a bowl! The incident happened in Lograno, a town in northern Spain. He was later penalised by the authorities for breaking the code. \r\n \r\nThe tweet below translates into \"Agents of the police force have found a person for going out to \"walk\" their fish on the street. Agents spotted him on #Logroño carrying a fish tank against what is stipulated in the RD of the State of Alarm.\" Earlier, on March 25, a man was seen walking his hen. Take a look below! The police tweeted, \"Civil guards of #Lanzarote fined a person for failing to comply with the movement limitation measures imposed by the state of alarm while walking a hen\". In another bizarre incident in Spain, an unidentified citizen in Murcia was seen dressed as a Tyrannosaurus rex. The images went viral on social media! It only gets stranger in the land of Spain: Another person was arrested for walking a toy dog on a leash. Video below: After this clip went viral, the police announced: \"Do not try to deceive us!\" Spain recently decided to extend its lockdown until May 9, to ensure that the slowing rate of infections continues steadily. In Spain alone, over 20,000 people have died of the virus so far.

It also comes as an opportunity for those seeking to make a shift toward healthier living. Well, why not start today! As per World Health Organisation (WHO), this year's  World Health Day theme is 'Building a fairer, healthier world'.  Stating that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the countries hard, WHO mentioned that ours is an unequal world where \"some groups struggle to make ends meet with little daily income...little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services.\" WHO urged leaders around the world to \"monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are able to access quality health services when and where they need them.\" And while people across the globe are still struggling to come to terms with how much life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a U.K.-based price comparison website Money.co.uk has come out with a list of the world’s healthiest countries in 2021. The publications release this list every year and this time too it has been published on World Health Day.  The publication mentioned that their mortgage experts rank the healthiest countries and cities in the world on the basis of \"good food, good company and good transport links\". Additionally, conditions like air quality, pollution levels, cost of living, life expectancy among other things are taken into consideration.  Below is the list of the top 5 world's healthiest countries. According to the report, Spain is the healthiest country in the world. It mentioned a few reasons such as their Mediterranean lifestyle, walking as a mode of transport, which helps to lower deaths caused by pollution, cost of living is moderate among other things why the country topped their list.  l: As per the report, Portugal bagged the second spot on the list of the world's healthiest countries. Their high-ranking healthcare system is the reason why the country has achieved good rankings in several health indices over the years, including this one.  Switzerland is home to one of the happiest populations. In fact, according to the World Economic Forum's 2013 Human Capital Report, Switzerland invests more in the health, education and talent of its people than any other country in the world.  Home to the oldest living population in the world, Japan obviously has one of the highest life expectancies in the world! Other factors that contribute to Japan being in the top five are: their smaller portion sizes and protein-dense diet, their notoriously fast transportation, walking as the preferred mode of transportation and high cost of living matched with the price among other things.   Good healthcare system, healthy diet and clean water among other things such as low levels of smoking, makes Iceland one of the world's healthiest countries to live in. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/quarter/public/2021/04/11/969320-ezgif.com-gif-maker-2021-04-11t225943.433.jpg?itok=k1AtcD-H\" title=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" alt=\"IPL 2021 SRH vs KKR: Kolkata ride home despite Bairstow-Manish Pandey'...\" class=\"img-responsive\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162750", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "34613", "source": "scrapy"},

Speaking to reporters after a closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders on Saturday, Mr Lee said: “I told them that I had concluded that we should prepare to make such a move for nurses because people's attitudes have changed, because in social and work settings, the tudung is now more common. \"And on its own, we can see the merits of allowing ... Muslim nurses to wear the tudung with their uniform if they wish.” He added that the community leaders knew that the Government has been considering allowing Muslim nurses to wear the tudung for “quite some time”, because the Government has been “engaging and consulting them quietly”. But before the change is made, the Government will need to “prepare the ground”, said the Prime Minister. “We have to make sure that everybody understands this is a careful adjustment. Not a wholesale change, and we want people to realise what the limits are, as we make these changes,” Mr Lee added. “And we must make sure that Singaporeans, both Muslims and non-Muslims, are ready to accept the move.” The process will “take a bit of time”, and Mr Lee has asked the community leaders to help the Government with the process over the next few months. “I hope that by the National Day Rally, which will be at the end of August, we should be ready to make a decision, and I shall have something to report,” said the Prime Minister. The closed-door dialogue with Malay Muslim community and religious leaders was the Prime Minister’s first such dialogue since 2014, when the subject of wearing the tudung was also raised. “Today we had a candid and sincere discussion, focusing more specifically on tudung for nurses. But, of course, going beyond that too,” said Mr Lee. He thanked them for “walking with the Government on this complex journey” and for helping them to manage an important issue. “We are a multiracial and multireligious country. It's a delicate balance, but we are fully committed to preserving our harmony, and to maintaining our common space,” he said. “We want to avoid creating unintended consequences … when we make well intentioned moves.” Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the dialogue was “constructive and candid” and that the community leaders got to hear what the Government’s position and considerations are. He added that there was a common understanding that this issue must be approached carefully because it involves racial and religious sensitivities. \"Therefore, we cannot rush to a decision. At the heart of the matter is how we strike a good balance in allowing our nurses to put on the tudung with their uniform, so that this decision can win the support of all communities, preserve common space and at the same time strengthen our social cohesion,\" he said. He added that in doing so, the Government hoped it can support the request by nurses to don the tudung with their uniform. “We know, we empathise that they want to lead meaningful religious lives daily, because this is also their religious identity,” said Mr Masagos. “Our racial and religious harmony is precious and the Malay Muslim community will safeguard these together with the rest of Singaporeans. We’ll continue to engage Singaporeans on this matter. “I hope to seek everyone's support as we deliberate on this issue, and work towards an outcome that’s acceptable to all Singaporeans.” Mr Masagos added that the Government has “always empathised” with the request by nurses to put on their tudung with their uniform. “But we have to be very careful, because it is not just about the Muslim request alone. Any move, any change in our society must be (carried) very carefully, because it involves interaction with other people,” he added. He said it is a “whole-of-government” approach and that they are reaching out to “every stakeholder” on this issue. Minister for Home Affairs K Shanmugam in March signalled a likely change in the Government's stance on nurses wearing the tudung, and said they were consulting the community. MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) had raised the issue in Parliament earlier this year. Mr Masagos answered on Mar 8 that the Government would continue to have discussions and consultations with the community behind closed doors. Mufti Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir said on Saturday the tudung issue is about balancing the religious needs of communities. \"For example, in this case, the needs of Muslim nurses who choose to put on the tudung, while maintaining a high level of trust and confidence between communities,\" he said. \"So conversations between Government and community leaders and religious leaders are very important for us to consider the full range of perspectives, as well as context for the considerations involved before moving to shift the policy.\" He said it is very important that they “should not make a move that may undermine” Singapore's social cohesion, but instead to continue to strengthen it and \"enlarge our common spaces\". \"I think due to the hard work of our communities in forging greater trust and confidence, we are in a better position now to move on with such a change, and I hope that we will continue to give the support, working together with the relevant agencies to ensure that this policy shift will only result in a stronger and more united society,\" he said. Madam Rahayu Mohamad, a MUIS council member and former president of the Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS), said Muslim women who wish to \"observe their religious prescription\" would welcome the move.  \"The women that we actually talked to are educated and they're well informed, and the reason why they are still in these sectors is because they understand and (understand) very well in terms of the decision and the choices that they're making,\" she said.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162750", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48108", "source": "scrapy"},

The Duke of Edinburgh was an exemplary role model for the British people, and served the United Kingdom selflessly and with honour for over six decades. Singapore will always fondly remember the State Visit by Your Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh to Singapore in 2006, as well as the generosity and warmth His Royal Highness had shown to our former President Dr Tony Tan, during Singapore’s first-ever State Visit to the United Kingdom in 2014. The many decades of public service of His Royal Highness will continue to inspire successive generations of young people, and live on in the memories of many around the world. Our thoughts are with Your Majesty and the Royal Family during this time of mourning.  Yours sincerely Halimah Yacob 10 April 2021 Your Royal Highness, I was saddened to learn of the passing of your father, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. As we mourn his passing, we remember the significant and remarkable life that he had led, dedicated first and foremost to service to the United Kingdom and its people, as well as to the peoples of the Commonwealth and the world at large. He had an indomitable spirit, fighting for peace and justice in the Second World War in his early years, and later steadfastly pursuing environmental causes, where he was well ahead of the times, and taking a close interest in sports and education. His selfless devotion to service has contributed much to advance and uplift the livelihoods of people in the United Kingdom and within the Commonwealth. We will also remember him for his steadfast support of Her Majesty The Queen.  One of his distinguished achievements was the creation of The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme over six decades ago. The awards nurtured and empowered young people to gain the skills, confidence and resilience to become exceptional individuals who can make a difference and contribute to society. The scheme also inspired Singapore’s own National Youth Achievement Award programme, which was launched in 1992. It was clear that the Duke of Edinburgh made education an utmost priority. He visited the National University of Singapore in 1972, and the United World College of Southeast Asia in 1989. He also met students from the Singapore Sports School during Her Majesty The Queen’s State Visit in 2006, where I had the great pleasure to meet him. On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you my deepest condolences and sympathies for this immense loss. He will be remembered and missed. Yours sincerely, Lee Hsien Loong His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland   10 April 2021 Dear Prime Minister Johnson, On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I extend to you and your Government my deep condolences on the passing of His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Throughout his life, the Duke of Edinburgh devoted himself to public service in support of the Crown and Government. With a steady resolve to uplift livelihoods, he brought forth many initiatives over the years, which continue to benefit the people of the United Kingdom as well as the larger Commonwealth family. His unwavering support of Her Majesty The Queen in fulfilling her role as Head of the Commonwealth was evident in his multiple pioneering efforts. These include his project to empower the youth of the Commonwealth, through ground-breaking initiatives such as the Commonwealth Studies Conferences which enabled them to acquire the skills, self-confidence and resourcefulness to meet the challenges of the future. It is a testament to his foresight that these initiatives continue to support social progress for people across the Commonwealth to this day. We have warm memories of the Duke of Edinburgh’s many visits to Singapore, both accompanying Her Majesty The Queen and in his capacity as a member of the Royal Family. His visits regularly featured tours to one of our nature and wildlife reserves and educational institutions. It reflected his lifelong support for environment and education causes. We recall his gracious opening of the Singapore Polytechnic, one of our oldest post-secondary institutions, during his first visit in 1959. The Duke of Edinburgh’s contributions to the Commonwealth and the furthering of close relations between our countries are part of his lasting legacy. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with you, your Government and the people of the United Kingdom as you mourn the loss of a public figure who was much loved and respected by all of us.

A statement from the ministry said that one of the two patients who died Friday is Noun Sophany, the 65-year-old wife of popular Cambodian crooner Hour Lavy. She was known to have been suffering from chronic diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. The second patient was identified as a 46-year-old Cambodian male from the capital Phnom Penh’s Toul Kork district. Doctors told the Khmer Times that he did not have any other serious health problems and that the main cause of his death with COVID-19. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Prime Minister Hun Sen said Friday that some 300,000 people have already been inoculated with vaccine from China-based Sinopharm and U.K.-based Astra Zeneca. The latter’s vaccine, he said, is being prioritized for people 60 years of age and older, although “some hospitals in Phnom Penh vaccinated people who are younger than 60, which goes against distribution policy.” Hun Sen said he had bought 1.5 million additional Sinopharm doses which are expected to arrive in Cambodia by late March, and another batch of 400,000 doses expected in April. He made the comments while touring a new 500-bed hospital on the outskirts of Phnom Penh that is designated solely for COVID-19 patients. However, members of the public have been critical of Hun Sen’s plans to purchase vaccines from Sinopharm, saying they only trust vaccines that have been recognized by the WHO. They have also called for a distribution plan free from bias.  The update on COVID-19 deaths and efforts to battle the coronavirus came as Cambodia recorded 30 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, bringing the total number of cases across the country since the beginning of the pandemic to 1,578, while the Ministry of Health warned that a Feb. 20 community event that “breached quarantine” is expected to raise the total number to more than 1,600 by Saturday. Earlier this week, Cambodia reported a daily record of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. On Friday, the Ministry of Health issued a joint statement with the WHO, warning that Cambodia is “at a critical point in the fight against COVID-19.” “The current COVID-19 situation in Cambodia remains serious. What we do right now will determine the course of this outbreak,” Minister of Health Mam Bunheng said. “We must accelerate our efforts to stop the spread of [the coronavirus] in the coming days and weeks. Lives depend on it.” Li Ailan, WHO representative to Cambodia, warned that COVID-19 can “affect anyone at any time.” “The country is at a critical stage of fighting against COVID-19, but we have a window of opportunity to stop virus spread if we all act together with solidarity,” Li said. The statement urged Cambodian to “follow the 3 do’s and the 3 don’ts” of wearing masks properly, washing hands frequently, and maintaining a distance of at least six feet from others, while abstaining from entering places with poor ventilation, joining crowds, and touching others. It warned that large scale transmission could require largescale restrictions and lockdowns and would likely cause hospitals and health facilities to become overwhelmed, making it difficult for people with COVID-19 and other health conditions to receive care. Earlier this week, the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner in Cambodia (OHCHR Cambodia) warned that discrimination against people who have contracted COVID-19 can often prove more dangerous than the disease itself. In a post to Facebook, the OHCHR said that “hate speech spreads faster than [the coronavirus] and makes those targeted more vulnerable to violence, exclusion, isolation and stigmatization” and deters them from accessing medical services, increasing the risks for everyone.” The OHCHR’s message came after several social media users took to Facebook to attack people, including film stars, for allegedly spreading the coronavirus amid the recent outbreak.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162750", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12075", "source": "scrapy"},

The Central forces gunned down four persons at Sitalkuchi in Coochbehar. Another death also happened in the morning. From the very first day I have been vocal. Central forces are not my enemy. But the way it killed four voters standing in the queue only proved the Union home minister's conspiracy that has been on. Mr Shah, you must resign as you are the conspirator.\"   She alleged, \"After killing so many people, the BJP now claims the firing was in self-defence. They must hang themselves in shame! Where did they get so much audacity from? Where do so many atrocities originate from? BJP knows it has lost in the polls. That is why they are killing the voters and workers. What fault did they commit?\" Puncturing the Trinamul Congress supremo's claim, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was also in the state for poll campaign in two districts, referred to Ms Banerjee's alleged provocation to attack the Central forces and warned her and her party workers against hooliganism.   He mourned the loss of lives and urged the Election Commission for strong punishment for the accused of the killings. Addressing a BJP rally in Siliguri of North Bengal, Mr Modi said, \"What happened in Coochbehar is very sad. I mourn the loss of lives in the killings. My condolences with their families. Didi and her goons have been panicked to see the support of the people for the BJP. Seeing herself losing the chair, Didi has stooped to such a low level! But I want to make it clear to the TMC, Didi and her goons that their muscle-flexing will not be allowed in Bengal. I request the Election Commission to take stringent action on the accused of the incident.\"   He however told Ms Banerjee, \"But your tricks to provoke the people in attacking the Central forces on poll-duty and obstruct the polling process will not be able to save you. Your violence after a decade-long misdeed cannot save you. People are casting their votes in large numbers for BJP. North Bengal has shown it.\"  Standing by the Central forces for their role in the poll duty, Mr Modi observed that the TMC chief, not the forces, has become the biggest trouble in the polls.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162750", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16906", "source": "scrapy"},

Whether it’s the sprawl of malls in the heartlands, the opening of Changi Airport Jewel or even complaints from locals about how repetitive and unimaginative the tenant mix across shopping centres can be, this beloved shopping belt has battled countless fresh challenges, yet always seems to find a new way forward. Recently, however, some small changes suggest the test wrought by COVID-19 may go deeper than we realise and could reshape Singapore retail for good. This latest set of challenges started right after Singapore announced it was raising the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) to Orange in February 2020, with a few retailers curbing opening hours to mitigate infection risks. Department store OG closed an hour earlier at 8.30pm so employees could head home earlier. Temperature checks, disinfections and mask-wearing were stepped up by store management. But an OG spokesperson highlighted a decline in footfall with stores becoming  . BHG Holdings also reported a 40 to 50 per cent drop in transactions across its six outlets in early February since the first confirmed case on Jan 23. Takashimaya, which occupies most of Ngee Ann City’s right wing, shortened operations from 11am to 8pm daily. And then the circuit breaker was pulled. Malls and department stores, not deemed essential service providers, had to shutter almost completely over April to June 2020. As Singapore gingerly peeled back restrictions, life was breathed back into Orchard Road. Department store Takashimaya reopened for business after Jun 18, 2020, starting with shorter hours from 11am to 8pm daily, subsequently extending these to 10am to 9.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays in Singapore’s Phase 2 in July 2020. Capitalising on the festive season, Takashimaya stretched weekday opening hours during the Christmas and Chinese New Year periods, to 9.30pm in December 2020 and from Jan 15 to 21, although restrictions on promotional events remained in place. Curiously, however, as Singapore shifted into Phase 3, allowing dining out for groups of up to eight, Takashimaya opted to revert to shorter hours from 11am to 8pm from Sundays to Thursday, earlier than the shopping mall’s hours of 10am to 9.30pm. Takashimaya may have more liberty in deciding its opening hours. Unlike most retail tenants with stipulated operating hours in their contracts, Takashimaya department store has closer ties to the mall manager, Toshin Development Singapore, a subsidiary of Takashimaya Group. Still, this earlier closure of an anchor tenant has seen knock-on effects on foot traffic in the mall. Food and beverage (F&B) outlets find it harder to attract crowds during these unpopular hours.   The few restaurants that retain long, pre-COVID operating hours appeal to designated diners. Imperial Treasure Fine Shanghai Cuisine closes at 11pm daily, Crystal Jade Place at 10.30pm, and Angus House, post-dinner coffee shop Heavenly Wang, Japanese burger chain store Mos Café and dessert house The Dark Gallery closing at 10pm. In many ways, Takashimaya’s decision to shave off 14.5 hours each week made business sense to contain labour and utilities costs when retail demand remains sluggish. By keeping daily operations to nine hours, retailers can cut down the need to deploy two shifts of employees a day. Under Singapore’s employment rule, contractual work hours should not exceed nine hours for a typical worker hired on a five-day-or-fewer contract. Shorter operating hours could reduce utilities costs, where the tenant is responsible for the running costs of air-conditioning, lighting and other mechanical and electrical equipment within the departmental store. The Job Support Scheme (JSS) that co-funds a proportion of the wages of the first S$4,600 gross wages of employed Singaporeans and permanent residents has seen the quantum come down since the circuit breaker lifted.  From 75 per cent, the JSS support level for retailers was reduced to 50 per cent after the circuit breaker ended, then to 30 per cent in September 2020. It stands at 10 per cent now.  Property tax rebates passed on by property owners have dried up. Although retail rent is expected to fall by a potential further 5 per cent in the first half of 2021, according to Knight Frank, these will eventually bottom out. Meanwhile, retail balance sheets are coming under strain all around the world, with Takashimaya in Japan reporting an operating loss of 10.8 billion yen (S$130 million), its first since beginning quarterly earnings disclosures in 2002. Perhaps there was little gained by opening longer hours in the evenings.  Overall, shoppers have not returned to pre-coronavirus levels, with the glaring gap left by international tourists unfilled even as locals stay in Singapore and spend more. The creation of green lanes with a handful of countries has given tourism some breathing space but arrivals have remained less than 5 per cent of pre-coronavirus numbers. Notably, footfall across selected Orchard Road malls (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Somerset 313) in October 2020 have been relatively lower especially after 9pm during weekdays. Google’s popular time graphs, which use real-time data to measure average popularity for any given hour relative to peak popularity for the business over a week, show relatively low traffic in these malls after 9pm. In contrast, average visits to heartland malls, such as JEM, Junction 8 and Jurong Point were relatively higher both on Wednesday and the weekend. Similar to Takashimaya’s strategy, Tangs department store, the anchor tenant at Tang Plaza, is also operating on shorter hours from 11.30am to 8.30pm daily. However, other malls along Orchard Road, such as Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon and Wheelock Place, are keeping the malls open for a longer duration of 10am to 10pm. The operating hours of the anchor tenants in these malls are more aligned with the malls’ hours. For example, Metro Paragon is open from 10am to 9.30pm; Isetan at Wisma Atria, from 11am to 9pm; and Marks & Spencer at Wheelock Place, from 10am to 10pm. Where cost-cutting is certainly no panacea, perhaps retailers and malls are using shorter hours as a holding pattern while they figure out a stronger strategy to deal with the huge, permanent shifts in consumption accelerated by the pandemic. Takashimaya has invested in building an online store, as has BHG Singapore. Others like Metro and Marks & Spencer have added storefronts on Lazada. After all, the outlook for retail could be positive when retail has picked up steadily since shops resumed business after the circuit breaker, with total retail sales in Singapore ending 2020 close to pre-coronavirus levels. These retailers know most of this recovery went to online retail. The shift away from physical stores to e-commerce continues to show stickiness even after June 2020. And they may be preparing for the reality that physical retail could remain subdued and track less than 2019 levels if tourism numbers remain in suspended animation. That outlook, however, is improving as more office workers return to the Central Business District and main shopping belt in greater numbers and frequencies after Monday (Apr 5) and as Singapore's rollout of the vaccination programme gains steam. For those reasons perhaps, Takashimaya has lengthened its opening hours to 10am to 9.30pm. Perhaps it also knows not keeping up risks losing loyal customers to competing malls.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/9068518/1957a42a2a1da80ba693669103d71585/sing-tien-foo-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Sing Tien Foo \">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162751", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "49262", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.rfa.org", "section": "cambodia", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/sanctions-03222021183753.html", "title": "Cambodia Confirms Fourth COVID-19 Death as Government Closes Schools, Entertainment Venues", "author": null, "author_link": "", "published_date": "2021-03-22", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Cambodia recorded its fourth COVID-19 death Monday as the country ordered the closure of schools and entertainment venues amid an intensifying outbreak of the coronavirus that causes the disease more than a year after it was labeled a global pandemic. According to the Ministry of Health, 75-year-old retired doctor Sderng Chea was admitted to the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in the capital Phnom Penh on Sunday with a severe lung infection and died a day later from complications related to COVID-19. Sderng Chea had served as the chairman of the Medical and Sports Science Committee of the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia. RFA’s Khmer Service was unable to reach Ministry of Health spokeswoman Or Vandine for comment on the country’s fourth COVID-19 death, but she told local media that before his arrival at the hospital, Sderng Chea was in “critical condition.” Speaking to Bayon TV, Or Vandine said that the spread of the coronavirus is “on the rise” in Cambodia, affecting both children and the elderly, and suggested that a “vicious new mutation” is making it more difficult for medical professionals to treat the infected. She warned the public not to doubt the seriousness of the virus or to assume it is a hoax. “Some people say they don’t believe it is a real virus or a pandemic, and claim it is an organized scam,” she said. “Let me ask you, how can you organize and fabricate the number of dead? We must realize this is the life of a person, not a joke, but some people are falling victim to fake propaganda.” So far, seven people have died while being treated for COVID-19, but the Ministry of Health only acknowledges that four people—including Sderng Chea—have died of the disease. The ministry claims that the other three deaths were caused by heart disease and severe pneumonia. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. While the country has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. By Monday, the number of infections had climbed to 1,753. Despite the month-long outbreak, it was only on March 20 that Cambodia’s government issued an order closing the country’s schools and entertainment venues—including cinemas, theaters, and museums. However, factories—which have recorded an increase of cases among staff—remain open with workers commuting crammed together in the backs of trucks daily. Social development analyst Seng Sary told RFA that the public has become more vigilant as the death toll has increased. But he urged the government to work harder to prevent the spread of the virus, saying it is imperative for both authorities and the public to cooperate. “There are still some citizens who neglect the safety rules and hold small gatherings,” he said. “But mostly, we have started to see people become more cautious … after seeing four people die. I hope we all take more caution.” Also on Monday, Cambodia’s lesser-known opposition Grassroot Democratic Party (GDP) called on the government to devise specific plans to address the recent outbreak and the national economy, which has suffered during the pandemic, particularly due to rising unemployment. The party, which lacks a seat in the National Assembly, urged the government in a statement to respond in a timely manner, including by establishing a commission to study key issues, such as targeted assistance, the informal economy, the return of migrant workers from abroad, and how much of the national budget should be allocated to helping to support the livelihood of the people and facilitate debt repayment.  In addition, the GDP called for a commission to study farming production that can help the economy rebound and create local jobs, as well as how the business community can assist in a national recovery after the threat of the coronavirus is over. GDP founder Yang Saing Koma told RFA that the government’s current measures are insufficient and called for a “clear, master plan” that promotes contributions from all parties and development partners. “This is not about the Grassroot Democratic Party, it’s about the whole nation and its need to respond to the current problems—especially how we can quickly recover our economy and tourism sector after the crisis.” Ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) spokesman Sok Eysan called the GDP’s statement a “political ploy,” adding that the government already has control of the situation. He noted that the government has set up quarantine centers, as well as provided food and additional funding to the public. “Those who have political motives against the government were chosen to be interviewed, such as motorbike taxi drivers, and then their interviews were broadcast on Radio Free Asia,” he said. “Therefore, the problem seems unsolvable.” “I follow RFA closely. I’m on top of the situation and I regularly compare between the news broadcasts and the reality in Cambodia.” Sok Eysan did not elaborate on how the two situations differ. The World Bank recently warned that, because of the pandemic, poverty in 2020 could increase among households involved in key sectors like tourism, construction, trade, manufacturing and the garment industry.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162750", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12480", "source": "scrapy"},

Speaking to RFA’s Khmer Service on Wednesday, Women for Society Association President Keo Tithlida said that while her group no longer plans to lead a march of supporters to Hun Sen’s cabinet office, she plans to petition the prime minister herself. “City Hall said if we proceed with the march, we will be opposing the law,” she said. “We are not in opposition to the municipal authorities … I am willing to go alone, as long as the petition reaches the [central] government.” While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. By Wednesday, the number of infections had climbed to 1,817. Independent Democracy of Informal Economy Association (IDEA) President Vorn Pov told RFA that the government needs to do more to help those in need, echoing several of the Women for Society Association’s demands. “The government should consider providing people daily sustenance, stimulus checks like neighboring countries, free utilities, and intervene in loan debts,” he said. Phnom Penh’s refusal to allow the Women for Society Association to march later this week came as representatives of around 100 scavengers who rely on what they can pick out of the city’s dumpsters told RFA that their hardships have become even more pronounced due to coronavirus restrictions. One scavenger named Bun Mann said that quarantine rules have prevented her children, who recently returned to Cambodia from neighboring Thailand where they labored as migrant workers, from seeking employment back home. “It is very difficult to earn a living during the coronavirus,” she said, adding that she has been forced to take on extra work to support her family. A taxi driver in Siem Reap named Kim Nai told RFA that he had been out of work for a year because no tourists are coming to the area to visit Angkor Wat. He said he had been forced to scavenge, picking up snails and crabs from local rice fields to buy food. “It’s been very quiet, with no tourists,” he said. “Before the coronavirus, I could barely make enough, but now it is even worse. I have no steady income.” Kim Nai said that if he is lucky, he can earn between 5,000 and 10,000 riel (U.S. $1.25 and $2.50) a day, although he often does not have enough rice to eat because he can’t find enough to scavenge. Another taxi driver in Siem Reap named Pok Tho said the decline in tourists also caused him to give up driving. Instead, he said, he now raises chickens and ducks to earn a living. “As someone who relies on tourists, I’ve been left with no income,” he said. “To be honest, if I have enough food in the morning, I won’t have enough in the evening.” Pok Tho said he hopes to find a job in construction but has yet to do so. According to the  , Cambodia Association of Travel Agents (CATA) president Chhay Sivlin said Tuesday that the prolonged pandemic had devastated Cambodia’s tourism industry, warranting government support. Cambodia’s Ministry of Tourism has said that from January to March last year, Cambodia hosted 1.16 million international tourists, a decrease of 38 percent over the same period a year earlier. In the second quarter of 2020, the number of tourists had dropped by 90 percent. Angkor Enterprise, the agency that sells tickets to the Angkor Wat complex, said that slightly more than 400,000 people visited the site over the past two months—a decline of 99 percent from a year ago. Hotel manager Eang Chhal told RFA that around 200 five-star hotels had been forced to close their doors during the pandemic, while several other tourism-related businesses had also been shuttered, but the cost of meat and vegetables is up. Ministry of Tourism recently announced that it will waive fines for tourist businesses that have yet to apply for licenses until the end of the year, after around 30 percent filed for closure or suspension of operations.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/relief-03242021165239.html/cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020-1.jpg/@@images/3628f6f5-207e-414d-8841-4aa8588c5d19.jpeg\" title=\"cambodia-monks-angkor-wat-nov-2020.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162751", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12570", "source": "scrapy"},

I decided that we were going to read Dr. Seuss’ “And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street.” I cradled the book in my hands, feeling very much like I was palming explosive contraband. The kids settled in on either side of me. My youngest, my sensitive 9-year-old son, snuggled close to my chest. My 15-year-old daughter raised her eyebrows as she looked down at my choice of books. She was aware of the announcement from the Dr. Seuss Foundation that it would be effectively “canceling” six of the author’s books due to their racist imagery.  “Sit down,” I said, patting the cushion beside me.  She did so wearily, crossing her arms. She was used to family nights where we would either play a board game, watch a movie or read a book, but she was apprehensive about this book.  “Don’t worry, I’ll explain,” I told her.  Finally, she melted and leaned her head against my shoulder. The gesture said, “I trust you, Mom.” I started to read the book and every few pages I stopped so we could discuss what we were seeing. “What’s this?” I asked them, pointing to a wildly stereotypical caricature of an Asian character.  “It’s racism,” my daughter quipped.  My son looked up at me, moony-eyed and confused.  “I don’t get it,” he said. The comment encouraged a conversation about harmful Asian stereotypes. We talked about misrepresentation, ethnocentrism and underrepresentation. After reading “And to Think That I Saw it on Mulberry Street,” we read Belle Yang’s book “Hannah is My Name,” a beautiful story about a young Taiwanese girl who immigrated to the United States. We examined the differences between the two stories ― the farcical treatment of the Asian characters in Seuss’ book versus the empowerment and voice given to Yang’s protagonist.  I explained that the latter comes from the fact that Yang herself is a Taiwanese woman and how this lends authenticity to her text that is sorely missing in Seuss’ books. Without this comparison, my children would have never known how a marginalized author’s voice can change the narrative and also help to subvert harmful stereotypes.  I believe as parents it is irresponsible to avoid children’s books that include racist ideology. Racism doesn’t disappear because we shut our eyes and pretend it doesn’t exist. We must arm our children with the tools to spot it ― and then fight it.  This is a hard truth I have had to grapple with as I silently watched each one of my childhood treasures receive the ax of condemnation. While I struggled with the pain of the denouncement of such books as “The Jungle Book,” “Peter Pan,” and ”The Little House on the Prairie,” I also found myself experiencing an awakening. I remember this moment vividly. I remember running to my desk and sitting down to write a list of my favorite childhood books. As my list grew longer, I noticed a pattern: There was an absence of any characters that looked or spoke like me. To be honest, there is an impenetrable wave of whiteness that engulfs these novels and a simultaneous silencing of othered voices. Because of this, when I was in high school, it wasn’t strange to me when “To Kill a Mockingbird”’s Atticus Finch swooped in to save the downtrodden Tom. It was what was normal to me. All of my literary heroes were white, and the people of color in books were woefully one-dimensional and easily forgettable cardboard figures. Later on, I didn’t bat an eyelash while reading about Huckleberry Finn sliding down the Mississippi River with his dehumanized Black companion Jim. To me, reading these books confirmed an essential truth about myself that I had been taught and then resigned myself to: I was Black, and I would never be the hero. Now, as a mom and an educator, I look at these books with a discerning eye.  When I read the books with my children, we immediately discuss the book’s time period, the author’s intent and the harmful depictions of marginalized people. For my students, the majority of whom are white, I find it equally important to apply these same concepts.  Huckleberry Finn, a staple in our 11th grade English curriculum, has been on the banned book list for many years, but I contend that this is an important text to teach. Although Twain uses the n-word 219 times in Huckleberry Finn, there is a method to the madness. Removing the word desensitizes the horrific nature of the time period. It delegitimizes Jim’s struggle. Removing the book from the curriculum altogether serves as an erasure of history. It doesn’t just erase Mark Twain’s words, it erases Jim ― the echo of the lived experience of so many American slaves. Instead, I believe it’s better to give students the tools to dissect and critically explore these types of books in order to ensure a healthy discourse. Furthermore, it is important to realize these texts are not vehicles of complete evil and that we can’t just throw the baby out with the bathwater. It is more nuanced than that. After all, there is a reason Jim, an uneducated slave, is the pinnacle of morality in the Huck Finn text.  ", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162747", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "61039", "source": "scrapy"},

And as our bodies and our hormones are unique to us, we don’t all share the same experience when we’re going through it. While some women experience nothing other than their period ending, other women experience the full monty of side effects, including hot flashes, weight gain and hormone swings.  Even knowing about the possible side effects, menopause was something I looked forward to. If my youth was going to go into retirement, not getting my period was a pretty good part of the severance package. Since there’s no way to know for sure when you’ll start menopause, most doctors make an educated guess based on when your mother or grandmother went through it. My mother had a hysterectomy in her 40s, and there was a rumor in my family that my grandmother went through it in her 60s, but I was hoping that was apocryphal. I decided arbitrarily that at the age of 47, my period would be over.  Unfortunately, my body wasn’t on the same page. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/606202ef2400006407260137.jpg?ops=100_100\" height=\"38px\" width=\"38px\" alt=\"headshot\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162751", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "60385", "source": "scrapy"},

All stakeholders must be consulted before making sweeping decisions.\" \"On how many counts does GOI intend to play with the future of India's youth?\" he added. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has also written to the education minister to consider the demands of students for cancelling the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams. Vadra said that its 'shocking' that the CBSE has decided to go ahead with exams despite parents expressing fears and 'apprehensions' about assembling at exam centres in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. She said these 'apprehensions' are not 'Unreasonable', so exams should be cancelled. She, in her letter said, \"It will be practically impossible to ensure the safety of students at large and at crowded exam centres. Additionally, given the nature and the spread of the virus, it is not just the students who will be at risk but also their teachers, invigilators and family members who are in contact with them. Aside from this, by forcing the children to sit for these exams during a raging pandemic, the Government and the CBSE board will be held responsible in the event that any of the exam centres prove to be hotspots at which large numbers of children become infected with the disease.\" The ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra has also appealed to the Centre to take a uniform decision on the board exams of Classes 10 and 12 across the country in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A unilateral decision by any state would lead to students of that state being at a disadvantage in terms of career and opportunities, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said in a letter, dated April 10, addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. \"Your intervention would mean national consensus, instead of a unilateral decision by any particular state,\" Sawant said in his letter. The exams are due in a few days which will put several students and their families, teachers and non-teaching staff at high risk, he said. According to the revised date sheet for CBSE board exams 2021, the Class 10 exams would be held between May 4 and June 7 and those for Class 12 would be held between May 4 and June 15.

Under pressure from authorities, the group had already canceled plans to lead a march to Hun Sen’s cabinet office in Phnom Penh, where they had planned to call for government payments to the millions of Cambodians left jobless as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Keo Thithlida, president of the Women for Society Association, and six other youths were held overnight by Stung Meanchey I district police and released next day after putting their thumbprints on a document handed to them by police, Yean Raksa—a member of the association’s board of directors—told RFA on Thursday. “They told me very briefly that they will now suspend their campaign and that they don’t want to talk about it,” Yean Raksa said. “I don’t know if they were simply told to do this or if they were pressured in some way.” “What I can see is that they are afraid,” he said. RFA could not reach the detained youths for comment, but the association later asked local media not to use any information in its reporting not taken from the group’s own Facebook page. “We don’t want to become a political tool,” Yean Raksa said. “We don’t want to see any allegations [made against us] of political motivations or ill will. We are youth with clean hands,” he added. Reached for comment, Phnom Penh Municipality Police spokesperson San Sokseiha declined to discuss the youths’ detention and release, saying he had no information about the case and was too busy to speak. But Ny Sokha, a spokesperson for the Cambodian rights group Adhoc, said the youths had not committed any crime. Forcing people to place their thumbprints on documents in exchange for their release is illegal and a violation of people’s rights, he said. “They were waging a normal [campaign],” he said. “They were seeking support because we live in a democratic world, and they should be allowed to express their views.” Many Cambodians are now struggling to pay their debts and meet the costs of rent, utility bills, and gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 after an already year-long shutdown of the economy. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day after the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Since then, five people have died as a result of the disease. While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. By Wednesday, the number of infections had climbed to 1,817. A court in Phnom Penh has meanwhile charged a Cambodian man in a first case of “tampering” under the provisions of a new law forbidding criticism of the Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccine. The accused, Tor Chanthi, was arrested on Wednesday after posting a video on TikTok urging factory workers not to take the shot.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162751", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12168", "source": "scrapy"},

The meeting comes after the group published   on Sunday and again on Wednesday accusing GM of \"systemic racism.\" The adverts, which ran in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Michigan Chronicle and the Detroit Free Press,   for not spending more on Black-owned media and slammed Barra for delegating their repeated requests for a direct meeting to her head of marketing. Signatories of the ad include Weather Channel owner Byron Allen; the rapper, actor and media mogul Ice Cube; and Junior Bridgeman, the owner of Ebony Media. One day after the first ad ran, the group held a brief video conference call with GM’s chief marketing officer, Deborah Wahl, GM spokesperson Pat Morrissey confirmed. That meeting will be followed up by an hour-long web discussion on Thursday. The ads asserted that GM only spends 0.5 percent of its ad budget on Black-owned media properties, while African-Americans make up about 14 percent of the U.S. population. And it said if Barra wouldn't meet with them, she should resign. Allen said the group is looking for GM to sign a $200 million-a-year deal for all Black media, growing annually by 5 percent over the next 10 years. “Mary Barra has the opportunity to be on the right side of history,” Allen told NBC News. He declined to say what the executives might do if GM does not offer an acceptable deal. Allen acknowledged that, by calling out America’s largest automaker, the group hopes to subsequently leverage any agreement to reach deals elsewhere. “Every corporation in America will be held accountable if they don’t do business with Black media in a respectable way,” he said. Morrissey said GM already spends “significantly” more than 0.5 percent with Black-owned media. \"With respect specifically to Black-owned media we increased our spend by 100 percent from 2020 to 2021, and we plan to grow from there. We will continue our efforts,\" he said. \"We are disappointed that Mr. Allen and his fellow signatories resorted to additional paid media advertising to advance a narrative of factual inaccuracies and character assault against our CEO, Mary Barra.\" \"It is particularly perplexing given that the paid advertising appears after the GM team has had repeated meetings with Mr. Allen and his team, and after we had scheduled a meeting between the signatories and Ms. Barra,\" Morrissey said. Benjamin Chavis, CEO and president of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, a trade group for Black media, said GM and Barra are \"taking steps to deal with systemic racism — but it doesn’t happen overnight, or in one year.\" He cautioned that systemic racism remains a major problem and, as much as GM has done, the automaker “and other corporations need to increase their advertising with Black-owned media.” Since becoming GM CEO in January 2015, Barra has declared a goal of creating “the most inclusive company in the world.\" Last week the company appointed two new members to its board of directors: former Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman and Mark Tatum, the deputy commissioner and COO of the National Basketball Association. After the death of George Floyd in police custody last May, Barra wrote a letter to employees saying that she was “impatient and disgusted” by the events and stressed the need to “individually and collectively” act. Last June 19 — known as Juneteenth, the commemoration of the emancipation of enslaved people in the United States — GM asked employees to observe 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the amount of time Chauvin is recorded as having his knee on Floyd's neck during his fatal arrest, as a sign of solidarity with the black community. (Prosecutors at Chauvin's murder trial in Minneapolis this week have said it was actually 9 minutes and 46 seconds.) But the newspaper ads said these moves didn't go far enough to create material change. “You stand on stage, after the death of George Floyd, saying, ‘Black Lives Matter,’ when you have refused to acknowledge us,” the ad says of Barra. “The very definition of systemic racism is when you are ignored, excluded and you don’t have true economic inclusion.” Barra declined a request for comment.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162750", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "41418", "source": "scrapy"},

However, no countries were named in particular. On March 21, new border rules were implemented by the Trump administration in purview of the coronavirus pandemic.

The longer-term impact of the reopening boom won’t be known until years into the future, he said, because it will take time to ascertain the quality of government spending, including President Joe Biden’s proposed $2 trillion infrastructure bill. “Spent wisely, it will create more economic opportunity for everyone,” he said. Dimon, 65, weighed in on a range of topics familiar to watchers of the country’s most prominent banker: He promoted JPMorgan’s efforts to create economic opportunities for Americans who have been left behind, highlighted threats to U.S. banks’ dominance from fintech and Big Tech players, and opined on public policy and the role of corporations to help bring about change. While Dimon called stock market valuations “quite high,” he said that a multi-year boom may justify current levels, because markets are pricing in economic growth and excess savings that make their way into equities. While he is bullish for the economy’s immediate future, there are serious challenges ahead for the U.S., Dimon said. The country has been tested before, through conflicts starting with the Civil War, the Great Depression and the societal upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s, he said. “In each case, America’s might and resiliency strengthened our position in the world, particularly in relation to our major international competitors,” Dimon said. “This time may be different.” The past year highlighted challenges for U.S. institutions, elected officials and families, as rivals see a “nation torn and crippled by politics, as well as racial and income inequality — and a country unable to coordinate government policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, regulatory) in any coherent way to accomplish national goals.” The country ultimately needs to “move beyond our differences and self-interest and act for the greater good,” Dimon said. “The good news is that this is fixable.” He also addressed inequality in the education system, \"terrible\" infrastructure and \"poorly designed\" social safety nets. \"It is hard to look at these issues in their totality and not conclude that they have a significant negative effect on the great American economic engine,\" Dimon said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3462671/210407-jamie-dimon-al-0755_eae68b742780e5dbd7e2d8a534fafa74.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Image: Jamie Dimon\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162756", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "39732", "source": "scrapy"},

Ketchup has always been a staple condiment for Americans, but since the pandemic forced many restaurants to ramp up their takeout game, the demand for those handy individual packets quickly skyrocketed. And the rules of supply and demand have led to a 13 percent increase in ketchup packet prices since 2020, according to the newspaper. Fast-food chains have always handed out these disposable packets, but sit-down restaurants have traditionally placed bottles of ketchup on tables or poured it out into a bowl for customers. With both food service models now competing for packets, or sachets, as industry experts call them, the supply chain has been stretched to its limit. Kraft Heinz is, of course, the most well-known ketchup manufacturer, and the company makes up nearly 70 percent of the U.S. retail market for ketchup, The Wall Street Journal reported. With more people eating at home, ketchup bottle sales have also increased 15 percent in the last year, to over $1 billion in 2020. As a result of the supply chain shortage, many restaurants are limiting the number of packets they give to customers or resorting to purchasing generic ketchup brands they normally don't use. Some popular fast-food chains like Long John Silver's and   have even had to reach out to secondary suppliers for the packets. Steve Cornell, Kraft Heinz’s president of Enhancers, Specialty and Away from Home Business Unit, told  the company is working hard to keep up the demand for those coveted ketchup packets as the takeout industry continues to explode. “The unmatched consumer love for our iconic HEINZ brand as well as our longstanding partnership with the restaurant industry are two responsibilities we take very seriously – which was why we made strategic manufacturing investments at the start of the pandemic to keep up with the surge in demand for ketchup packets driven by the accelerated delivery and take-out trends,\" he wrote in an email statement. Cornell also noted that Kraft Heinz has been looking into new packaging options to help evolve with its industry. \"At the same time, we also fast-tracked future-focused culinary and packaging innovations, as well as further manufacturing expansion plans, as we believe there is an enormous opportunity to grow our brands in the exciting foodservice industry,” he said. Fans of the 150-year-old ketchup brand will recall that Kraft Heinz invented a single-serve ketchup tray called the   in 2011. In November 2020, the brand also launched a   to help offer restaurants a sanitary way to allow customers to dispense their own condiments. Looking ahead to the future, Cornell said the company is banking on its multiple new production lines, which he hopes will yield a 25 percent increase in production, amounting to 12 billion ketchup packets a year.

This information should give the position as on 1st of March , 2021 and should also specify the vacancies which are going to arise in the next six months from that date.

The party’s bond with corporate America, however, is fraying. Fissures have burst open over the GOP’s embrace of conspiracy theories and rejection of mainstream climate science, as well as its dismissal of the 2020 election outcome. The most recent flashpoint was in Georgia, where a new Republican-backed law restricting voting rights   from Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, whose headquarters are in the state, and resulted in Major League Baseball pulling the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta. Republicans were furious. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned that their actions were   GOP strategists argued that they no longer needed corporate America’s money to win elections as they try to rebrand as a party of blue-collar workers. That extends an opportunity to President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats to find an ally in an unlikely place when the party has unified control of the federal government for the first time in a decade. Biden is pushing an ambitious $2.3 trillion infrastructure package that includes corporate tax increases — which the White House is characterizing to CEOs as upfront investments that will ultimately make companies more profitable. “It’s important for making the country more competitive,” said Cedric Richmond, the White House’s director of public engagement. “We think the plan is so important to the country that we are advocating and singing its praises to all businesses.” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo estimates she has talked to more than 50 business leaders about the plan, including a round of Easter weekend phone calls. She is encouraging companies to focus on the entire package instead of the tax increases. “You can’t look at one piece of it and say that one number makes you walk away,” she said. “They say, ‘That’s fair. Let me think about it.’ That’s how they run their businesses.” Whether the corporate split with the GOP widens could help answer questions about the political direction of the country and the extent to which business can continue to influence Washington. “Nobody in the business community wants hostile communities, angry finger-pointing workforces and turbulent shareholder bases,” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management. “It makes your job so much harder to have every constituency group at war within themselves, which has become the hallmark of the GOP.” Corporate America’s marriage with Republicans has long been one of convenience, united by a belief in low taxes and the need to repeal regulations. But the relationship, already strained during Donald Trump’s presidency, has come under increasing pressure as companies take cultural stands. That Republicans and businesses report to increasingly distinct constituencies helps explain the tension. A solid majority of Republican voters are white (86%) and older than 50 (62%), according to APVoteCast, a national survey of the 2020 electorate. Yet figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that workers are more racially diverse and younger than the Republican base. James Bailey, a management professor at George Washington University, published an analysis last year that suggested people who identified as Democrats cared more about a company’s political activity than Republicans do. Of business people, he said the uproar over the Georgia voting law “is a great opportunity for them to get on board with the young socially active consumer and to do so without much cost.” Just as important, Democratic counties have become the primary engines for growth. The counties that backed Biden last year account for 71% of all U.S. economic activity, according to the Brookings Institution. Democrats say business are comfortable partnering with them to address longstanding issues such as infrastructure after a decade of congressional gridlock, even though companies dislike the possibility of footing the bill. “Responsible corporate leaders want economic growth and predictable, competent policy— that’s what Democrats are offering.” said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who is running the House Democrats’ campaign arm for the 2022 midterm elections. Many Republicans are exasperated by business’s efforts to woo consumers through liberal social politics. “They are never going to satisfy the demands of the left,” said Steven Law, a former attorney for the Chamber who now runs Senate Leadership Fund, a big-spending outside group aligned with McConnell. Meantime “they risk alienating their natural allies in the Republican Party.” Still, Republicans have been a major driver of the rift, looking to capitalize on the culture clash to turn out the party base in the next election. Early indicators suggest business could face blowback. Georgia’s Republican-controlled House voted to strip Delta of a tax break worth tens of millions of dollars annually for its criticism of the new restrictive law, which voting rights groups have excoriated as an attack on democracy. The intended punishment was rendered moot after the GOP Senate failed to take it up before the legislative session adjourned. Campaign finance disclosures suggest corporate America’s money doesn’t buy as much influence as it once did. Roughly a decade ago, donations from company-sponsored political action committees accounted for an important share of the fundraising pie. But it’s stagnated as a source of campaign cash, as court rulings enabled wealthy GOP activists to pour money into the political system. Just 10 GOP megadonors account for half of the giving to major super political action committees controlled by Republican congressional leaders since 2012, collectively pouring $541 million into the committees, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of donors who gave over $1,000. The megadonors also contributed twice as much as conventional PACs and other groups that represent a broad swath of corporate interests. Political spending by the Chamber has also dropped precipitously. After spending $29 million in 2016, mostly supporting Republicans and attacking Democrats, the group’s contributions dropped to $10.9 million in 2018, according to data from nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. In 2020,  , which Republicans saw as a betrayal. That’s diminished the group’s once unassailable standing with GOP congressional leaders. “There is absolutely no love lost for corporations, especially when they consistently weigh in on things they don’t understand,” said Josh Holmes, a political adviser to McConnell. “There’s no sympathy.” Common ground still exists between Republicans and business on the value of tax cuts. The Chamber and the Business Roundtable oppose raising the corporate rate to 28% from the 21% level set in 2017, as well as an enhanced global minimum tax. Yet both groups want government spending on infrastructure. Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s chief policy officer, said the broader business community isn’t fully aligned with either party. But the hyperpartisan nature of today’s politics is creating pressure to choose one side. “It really causes people to want to sort everything into a red camp or a blue camp,” he said. “Businesses aren’t partisan. They aren’t Republicans or Democrats. They have to operate and function in divided governments, operate in states that are solid blue and solid red.” Republicans caution, however, that business faces considerable risk weighing in on hot-button disputes. “They ought to tread carefully because they risk getting into the middle of a culture war that will earn them no friends and a lot of enemies,” said Law, the McConnell ally.", "image_url": "<img class=\"image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/607316fa2100001c007eed39.jpg?cache=v9qmv89nid&amp;ops=scalefit_720_noupscale\" alt=\"In this April 5, 2021, file photo Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., listens to a reporter's question during a ne\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162757", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "60578", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.rfa.org", "section": "cambodia", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/sinovac-03262021175904.html", "title": "Sinovac Doses Arrive in Cambodia to Little Public Fanfare, Some Doubts", "author": null, "author_link": "", "published_date": "2021-03-26", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "The latest batch of China’s controversial coronavirus vaccination arrived in Cambodia Friday as the country confirmed its eighth death from COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, and continues to grapple with its worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic. The 1.5 million doses of Sinopharm’s Sinovac vaccination, purchased by Prime Minister Hun Sen’s government for around U.S. $15 million, were delivered to Cambodia as the number of people infected with COVID-19 in the country rose to nearly 2,000. Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wentian announced during a reception ceremony for the vaccines that China had sold the doses to Phnom Penh as part of a “special deal” and said he hopes the injections will help protect the country from the coronavirus. He said China will continue to assist Cambodia with vaccine supplies if the outbreak worsens, adding that there are currently more than 60 countries using the Sinovac injection. Cambodia’s Finance Secretary of State Vongsey Visoth told reporters at the ceremony that the government is seeking to buy additional vaccines from India and the U.S. but lauded the country’s special ties to China that had allowed for Friday’s delivery. “The solid steel relationship between Cambodia and China played a vital role in securing vaccine for our country in a timely manner,” he said. While Hun Sen did not take part in the reception ceremony, he posted a comment on his Facebook account saying that Cambodia is in negotiations to purchase around 4 million doses of Sinovac as part of a government push to vaccinate 10 million people, or more than two-thirds of the country’s population. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day after the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Since then, eight people have died as a result of the disease, with the eighth death recorded on Friday. While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. Rollbacks on democracy, including the disbanding of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), that led Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win the country’s election in a landslide in 2018 have led Western nations to increasingly shun Phnom Penh in recent years, while Chinese influence has grown in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation. While Beijing has showered aid on Cambodia, many Cambodians worry about China’s increasing presence in their country’s affairs and have even expressed wariness over the quality of its vaccines. On Friday, political analyst Kim Sok told RFA’s Khmer Service that the Sinovac vaccine doesn’t measure up to vaccines from the West that have earned the recognition of the World Health Organization (WHO). “Hun Sen’s government should have spent money on vaccines recognized by the WHO,” he said. “People have more trust in those vaccines.” Meanwhile, residents living in areas locked down as part of a bid to restrict the spread of the coronavirus in Cambodia urged the government Friday to provide special aid packages to help them during the outbreak. Many Cambodians are now struggling to pay their debts and meet the costs of rent, utility bills, and gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 after an already year-long shutdown of the economy that killed the tourism and entertainment industries. A villager from Siem Reap province named Yim Sogna told RFA that authorities in his district began enforcing the lockdown about a week ago and said he no longer earns an income. He accused the government of failing to address the needs of villagers. “How can we afford the cost of living for a 14-day quarantine,” he asked. “We’ve spent the money we made, but we need to pay the bank too. I call on the government to help the people.” Another villager in the seat of Sihanoukville province, who is also living in a locked down area, told RFA that work had dried up and he is in risk of defaulting on a loan he took to buy a motor taxi, and pay for his rent and utilities. “My situation is getting worse,” he said. “The government must intervene with the banks to suspend loan repayments for a few months.” Ministry of Finance spokesman Meas Soksensan refused to comment when contacted by RFA. Ny Sokha of local rights group Adhoc told RFA that the government needs to not only pay attention to fighting the coronavirus, but also the living standards of the people. He urged the government to release a stimulus package to subsidize those who have lost their incomes. “The government must resolve this posthaste,” he said. On Thursday, the World Bank issued a report which said that more than a year into the pandemic, the economies of East and Asia and the Pacific are facing a “markedly uneven recovery.” According to the Bank, only China and Vietnam are experiencing a V-shaped rebound where output has already surpassed pre-pandemic levels. “In the other major economies, output remained on average around 5 percent below pre-pandemic levels,” the report said. “Economic performance has depended on the effectiveness of virus containment, the ability to take advantage of the revival of international trade, and the capacity of governments to provide fiscal and monetary support.” On Friday, Cambodia’s Finance Ministry spokesman Meas Soksensan told RFA that the government had come to the same conclusion as the Bank, acknowledging that it has been “difficult” for Cambodia’s economy to grow during the pandemic. “The findings are normal because of the impact of the coronavirus,” he said, adding that Cambodia “cannot hope to achieve the same economic growth as before the pandemic.” “I hope that the global economy will recover because some countries have already developed vaccines and are now supplying them to the world.”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162754", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12646", "source": "scrapy"},

The initiative is called NinetyToZero, so named for the roughly 90 percent wealth gap between white and Black Americans. Its leaders describe the goal as providing a roadmap for organizations to “counteract centuries of discrimination, segregation, and financial exploitation,” according to the group’s launch plans announced Tuesday. “Every business has a responsibility — and can influence others — to advance racial equity, create opportunities for others and strengthen the communities it serves,” Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ CEO, said in a statement. “Starbucks believes in using our scale for good, and we will address the systemic barriers which keep Americans from reaching their full potential.” Organizations that join NinetyToZero agree to establish internal goals for hiring and promoting Black talent. They also pledge to calculate how much money is spent with Black-owned businesses and in Black-owned financial institutions. “Racial wealth inequity is a threat to child well-being and America’s future,” the Rev. Dr. Starsky Wilson, CEO of the Children’s Defense Fund, another inaugural member, said in a statement. “Institutions committed to the promise of Black children and families must push beyond public statements to concrete action to close the wealth gap.” According to the most recent Federal Reserve statistics available, white families have an average of $171,000 in net worth — including savings, investments and home ownership. For Black families, it’s $17,600. Economists say that closing the racial wealth gap would significantly benefit the nation as a whole. According to a McKinsey & Company report, wealth equity could raise U.S. GDP by $1.5 trillion within 10 years. “The key to narrowing the racial health gap is to narrow the racial wealth gap,” Michelle Williams, Dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which also joined the initiative, said in a statement. “The two go hand in hand, and we will all be the beneficiaries of a more equitable and just society.” Other companies are also working on the issue. United Airlines   that it will open its own flight academy to train 5,000 new pilots this decade, with plans for half of them to be women or people of color to increase diversity at the airline. The foundation Robin Hood, also a member, will incubate the initiative, which will accept other member organizations beyond the 10 inaugural groups announced Tuesday. Further research for new practices that can be used to reduce the racial wealth gap will come from another initiative member, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Also part of NinetyToZero’s inaugural class of organizations: The ACLU, Lord Abbett, McKinsey & Co., and SKDKnickerbocker. “Closing the racial wealth gap is more than a zero-sum game,” Robin Hood CEO Wes Moore said in a statement. “When Black families have economic security and agency, everyone benefits. Now is the time to be reflective, bold and transparent. And we urge and encourage companies and organizations across the country to join us and ensure Black Americans obtain equitable access to wealth, permanently transforming the country’s economic landscape for the better.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/rockcms/2021-04/855/210407-wes-moore-jm-1144-ef9dd6_8c496a30bdbf71d04e829057178dad9b8de76319.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"Wes Moore, CEO of Robin Hood, speaks at Howard University, in Washington on July 23, 2019.\" height=\"1669\" width=\"2500\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162756", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "40637", "source": "scrapy"},

In its annual Cambodian Journalism Situation Report, CamboJA said it recorded 35 cases of harassment against 72 journalists in 2020, based on news reports, social media posts, court documents and interviews, and that more than 42 of them were detained for questioning or imprisoned. At least 22 journalists were either attacked or threatened with violence while working, the group said, and one journalist died in what police concluded was a traffic accident without carrying out what it termed a “proper investigation.” According to CamboJA, Cambodian authorities continued to use the threat of legal action to intimidate journalists in 2020, particularly the charges of “incitement to commit felony” or “extortion” under Articles 495 and 232 of the Criminal Code.  As of December, at least 10 journalists remain in prison in the country, eight of whom are in pre-trial detention for criminal charges, it said. “The ongoing imprisonment, detention and physical threats against journalists undermines the media’s role in a democratic society and strikes fear in those who cover stories or cases involving powerful officials,” CamboJA said in its report. “Journalists have generally been unsuccessful when turning to the courts for justice or protection, even when they are able to identify perpetrators such as military police, district security guards, timber traders and cock fighters. This impunity for crimes against journalists compounds the sense of fear and futility for those seeking to expose bad actors inside and outside of government.” Speaking to RFA’s Khmer Service, CamboJA executive director Nop Vy said that in addition to the threat of harassment and arrest, journalists also lack any support from relevant authorities. He also called the overall situation of press freedom in Cambodia in 2020 significantly worse than in previous years. “Pending cases involving journalists related to ethics and their profession as journalists should be dropped,” he said. “Stop filing lawsuits against them because all these cases create an environment of fear that impacts press freedom.” Ministry of Information Meas Sophorn responded to the claims in the report by saying that journalists in Cambodia “enjoy freedom of the press” and suggesting that certain NGOs were “not reporting the truth” about the situation. “In accordance with the law, they can fulfill the requirements of their profession freely and fully in the Kingdom of Cambodia,” he told RFA “There are many journalists working in the profession, and the number is increasing. However, journalists working in Cambodia are held accountable. If a journalist commits a crime, he must be held accountable before the law.” Media director of the Cambodian Center for Independent Media (CCIM), Ith Sothoeut, told RFA that when authorities use the criminal code to arrest journalists it forces them to self-censor. Ith Sothoeut called on the authorities to apply the country’s Press Law in support of journalists who report on the shortcomings of powerful officials and other problems in society. “As CambodJa mentioned in its report, so far, the Press Law has not been enforced in nearly all cases involving journalists,” he said. “On the contrary, the criminal code has been applied, which is unfortunate for journalists.” Yeang Sothearin and Uon Chhin—who had worked as an editor, reporter and news anchor, and a photographer and videographer for RFA’s Khmer Service, respectively—were taken into custody in November 2017. They remain out on bail but in legal limbo after a series of appeals have been rejected by courts. They were charged with “illegally collecting information for a foreign source” after RFA closed its bureau in the capital in September that year and were slapped with additional charges for illegally produced pornography in March 2018. If convicted of the first charge, they could face a jail term of between seven and 15 years. Paris-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Cambodia 144  out of 180 nations in its 2020 World Press Freedom Index, down from 143  a year earlier, citing a crackdown on independent media in the lead up to the country’s 2018 general election. The crackdown on the independent media came amid a wider attack by Prime Minister Hun Sen on the political opposition and NGOs that paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats up for grab in the ballot.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162757", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12106", "source": "scrapy"},

Of the infections, 964 were domestic transmissions, including 236 in the capital Bangkok, the epicentre of an outbreak that has spread to most of Thailand's 77 provinces. The spike comes ahead of major national Songkran holidays, known for big street water fights that authorities have now banned for a second year due to the pandemic. Authorities have urged people to avoid unnecessary travel and reduce gatherings to help limit the outbreak, which includes the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant first identified in Britain. \"Right now, the situation is worrying. But we can manage it if everyone helps,\" senior health official Sopon Iamsirithaworn, deputy director general of the Department of Disease Control, told a briefing. If the number of cases is still rising in two weeks, measures beyond the current restrictions on nightlife and longstanding social distancing rules will need to be put in place, he said. At least 38 provinces have required visitors from risk areas to undertake a 14-day quarantine. Nightspots such as pubs and karaoke bars in Bangkok and 40 provinces will be closed until Apr 23. The managers of two entertainment venues in Bangkok, where many infections were reported, had been sentenced to two months in jail for COVID-19 violations, police said on Sunday. The outbreak has become a political issue because of charges that senior members of government may have patronised the clubs and flouted health regulations. The country's transport minister tested positive for the virus, but he and other Cabinet members have denied the allegations. Dr Sophon explained that another reason the situation is “worrisome” is because the age groups among which most cases are found are in the 20-29 and 30-39 age brackets. “These groups have active lifestyles, therefore they can spread the virus to larger numbers of people,” Dr Sophon said. He noted also that they are relatively young and strong, tending to show little or no symptoms, thus masking their illness. The rapid rise in cases has been most marked in the capital, Bangkok, and the tourist destinations of Chiangmai in the north and Chonburi province in the east, home to the seaside resort town of Pattaya. Despite the risk, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha did not issue any ban on inter-provincial travel when he announced measures last week to combat the spread of the virus. Chiang Mai provincial health officials are requiring visitors from Bangkok and four surrounding provinces to self-quarantine for the duration of their stay, up to 14 days, the state Thai News agency reported. A 280-bed field hospital has been set up to treat COVID-19 patients. Thailand has reported 3,661 domestic infections so far this month, including 1,294 cases in Bangkok, the highest amid the new outbreak.

The government issued a sub-decree on Wednesday suspending all “unnecessary” business, gatherings, and travel between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. until April 14 to prevent further transmission of an outbreak that has seen 21 people who had tested positive for COVID-19—the disease caused by the coronavirus—die since February. The decree includes exceptions that allow people to buy food, get tested for COVID-19, get vaccinated against the coronavirus, receive medical treatment, or attend to a family member who is “seriously ill” or has died. Phnom Penh governor Khuong Sreng told RFA’s Khmer Service that employees who work night shifts must have an official certificate confirming their working hours and must always carry a company identification card to show to authorities. “Companies must issue official permission letters to their staff,” he told RFA’s Khmer Service. “Businesspeople who need to travel to places such as hotels must return to their homes at night with a certificate confirming that they have the right to do so.” Khuong Sreng added that all companies are responsible for their employees’ actions and could face legal action, including fines or license suspension, if they are found to be in violation of the curfew. “The head of the institution is responsible in case staffers leave work and go drinking, which will cause disorder and does not comply with the curfew ordered by City Hall,” he said. “If we investigate and find out that this is truly a problem, it may lead to fines or the closure of companies.” Members of the public who require travel during the curfew must inform their commune chief or local authorities in advance, Khoung Sreng said. Law enforcement has been ordered to confiscate the vehicles of people who disobey the curfew and place them in 14-day quarantine at their homes, he added. The Ministry of Health confirmed two COVID-19-related deaths on Thursday, bringing the country’s official count to 16 since early March and weeks after the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the coronavirus a global pandemic. Five other people who were confirmed positive for COVID-19 have died over the same period, although the government claims their deaths were the result of complications from pre-existing health conditions. The ministry also announced 37 new COVID-19 infections Thursday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 2,477. While Cambodia has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record late last month of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to nearly triple that of when the latest outbreak was first detected in February. Human rights groups expressed concern over the curfew Thursday, saying the measure was “unrealistic” for people who need to leave their homes at night in case of emergency. Am Sam Ath, deputy director of human rights for local group Licadho, called on the government to allow certain exceptions for the curfew. “Regarding people with urgent needs, it will be difficult to inform the authorities or their commune chief and receive permission to leave home, especially in the middle of the night,” he said. “There need to be exceptions in the case of an emergency related to health or family problems.” Residents living in areas of Cambodia locked down as part of a bid to restrict the spread of the coronavirus have urged the government to provide special aid packages to help them during the outbreak. Many Cambodians are now struggling to pay their debts and meet the costs of rent, utility bills, and gasoline amid Cambodia’s latest outbreak of COVID-19 after an already year-long shutdown of the economy that killed the tourism and entertainment industries.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162757", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11790", "source": "scrapy"},

They were just really highlighted during Covid, because we were literally zooming into people’s homes,” said one recruitment expert.", "text": "For millions of Americans, the pandemic triggered an acute caregiving crisis, with working parents leaving their jobs as weeks of remote schooling turned into an entire year. But it has also forced a reckoning in corporate America about the day-to-day demands on working caregivers in general — and working mothers in particular. “Child care and balancing the demands of, say, dealing with a sick kid, have been perennial issues, even pre-Covid,” said Andrew Challenger, vice president at executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The pandemic, Challenger said, essentially pulled back the curtain to expose a rickety, fragmented system that didn’t function very well even at the best of times. When school resumed last fall, 865,000 women dropped out of the workforce between August and September alone, and women’s labor force participation has continued to plummet: As of last month, the labor force participation rate for men older than 19 was 69.5 percent. For the corresponding cohort of women, it was 57.4 percent. What happens next — and how much of the lessons of the pandemic will be retained in the future — could turn out to be an unexpected silver lining during a year of unprecedented stress and challenges. “Sometimes it takes a big crisis to set in motion shifts in compensation,” Challenger said. “This has always been part of the conversation — how do you give flexibility for the worker but still have consistency for the employer? This is something that has been exacerbated during the pandemic,” said Aliya Robinson, senior vice president of retirement and compensation policy for the ERISA Industry Committee, an association focused on benefits at large companies. “With this whole shift to work-from-home, I think a lot of employers realized there's a lot more ability than they anticipated to have employees working from home,” she said. This, in turn, has paved the way for greater acceptance of remote work, scheduling flexibility and more willingness to expand benefits specifically for caregivers — particularly as employers face the prospect of losing valuable talent. “I think it does indicate that this issue, particularly for women around caregiving and careers, has at least been recognized by a large number of organizations. In this crisis, we saw such an outflow of women from the workforce as the coronavirus hit,” Challenger said. “I think you’re starting to see smart companies recognize that if they want to be the best possible company they can be, which means having a diverse set of individuals leading their organization, that it's going to take an active effort to get women back into the pipeline and back into the office.” Research by the Society for Human Resource Management found that women are worried — often rightly so — that dropping out of the workforce can hurt their career advancement: A recent survey found that 27 percent of working women who also act as caregivers said the pandemic had hurt their professional development, compared to just 10 percent of men who said the same. According to surveys of 500 HR managers conducted by Care.com, human resources departments are reevaluating the kinds of benefits they offer employees — and making adjustments to address the yawning gap between caregiving demands and employers’ accommodation of those obligations. More than three in five survey respondents said they plan to increase childcare benefits, while about two in five will expand offerings for elder care. “Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, and that’s because we were literally 'Zooming' into people’s homes,” said Alyssa Johnson, senior director of account management at Care.com. “Employers have literally had a front-row seat into people's homes and lives, and they've seen the challenges families have faced,” she said. “It’s just an acknowledgement of this idea that emergencies happen, emergency child care situations arise. Companies that have now been forced to reckon with a mass child care emergency now have the tools and wherewithal to help employees,” Challenger said. Addressing this is less a matter of altruism than accounting. “Half of HR leaders are seeing productivity decrease in working parents,” Johnson said. “It’s never been clearer — employers are realizing that care challenges have had a significant impact on their workforce, and there is just a real connection between child care and employee performance.” In addition to diminished productivity, employee departures extract a tangible financial toll on employers. “They may actually lose a significant portion of their workforce. That can affect the bottom line,” said Amber Clayton, director of the Society for Human Resource Management Knowledge Center. The opportunity cost of having to devote resources to recruit, hire and train replacements when women leave the workforce can be steep: Pre-pandemic research from SHRM suggested that replacing a salaried employee can cost between six and nine months of that worker’s annual pay. “Hiring and re-hiring is really expensive. Companies are always looking to decrease turnover. There's a real recognition that this is an issue that needs to be addressed,” Challenger said. HR experts report that employers are experimenting with different tools and approaches to ease the burden of caregivers trying to juggle work and family obligations. In addition to greater acceptance of remote work and nontraditional work hours — including longer breaks so parents can supervise kids’ remote lessons — some have expanded paid or unpaid leave, provided subsidies for on-site or in-home child care, or offered on-site child care for employees who can’t work from home. “Employers have stepped up and are making those accommodations,” Clayton said. In a recent survey of more than 200 HR executives, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 84 percent said they are offering workers more flexibility, with many making changes specifically in response to workers’ caregiving obligations. Two out of five reported that they specifically have extended greater flexibility to parents, with 23 percent expanding paid time off and 13 percent offering child care options. Of those, the vast majority — 95 percent — said they plan to make some or all of these changes permanent. “I think it was very eye-opening for employers,” Clayton said. “It forced them to look at their policies and procedures overall.” This is a paradigm shift, experts say, that is long overdue. “It highlighted the need for employers to step in and play a role,” Johnson said. “When families are forced to choose between families and work, no one wins.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2021_14/3462714/210407-working-childcare-mn-1040_67b30ef91687ca8364dadee5fa16d84c.fit-760w.jpg\" alt=\"young woman working at home while holding her newborn baby son\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2499\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162757", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "43132", "source": "scrapy"},

Turns out, the Obama administration had been pushing for a universal healthcare infrastructure to globally deal with a potentially “air borne” pandemic, similar to the ongoing coronavirus crisis. “We have to put in place an infrastructure,  not just at home but also globally. That allows us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly”, he said in a briefing. \r\n \r\n Obama warned in 2014, that we must be ready to deal with an epidemic. “So that if and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish flu, crops up, five years or a decade from now - we’ve made the investment - and we’re further along to be able to catch it”, the former president had asserted. Obama called for more pandemic preparedness following the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which was then seen as a global threat. \r\n \r\n “The funding we’re asking for is needed to keep strengthening our capacity here at home so we can respond to any future Ebola cases.. It’s needed to help us partner with other countries to prevent and deal with future outbreaks and threats before they become epidemics”, Obama had said. He added how the world had got lucky in terms of the Swine Flu, which had subsided on its own. “We were lucky with H1N1 that it did not prove to be more deadly. We can’t say we’re lucky with Ebola because obviously it’s having a devastating effect tin West africa, but it is not airborne in its transmission”, he had said. However, coronavirus is airborne, and is way more deadly than any epidemic seen in recent history. “There may and likely will come a time in which we have both an airborne disease that is deadly“, he said predicted. Looks like his prophecy turned out to be true. “It’s not just insurance, it is knowing that down the road, we’re gonna continue to have problems like this - particularly in a globalised world”. \r\n \r\nHe had earlier written in an oped in New York Times back in 2005 - “We recommend that this administration work with Congress, public health officials, the pharmaceutical industry, foreign governments, and international organisations to create a permanent framework for curtailing the spread of future infectious diseases”. “I cannot think of a better example of an area where we should all agree than passing this emergency funding to fight Ebola and to set up some of the public health infrastructure in the world to deal with potential outbreaks in the future”. The incumbent US president Donald Trump had received reports about the seriousness of COVID-19 as early as March but continued to discount those well into March. At a briefing he said that the virus would go away by April because of the heat. But it has now killed over 30,000 people in the United States alone. According to new projections, 100,000-240,000 people are expected to die of the virus in the US alone.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2018/09/12/44453-obama-20171203054410-1170x645.jpg?itok=IPEIeLht\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162756", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "22576", "source": "scrapy"},

People under 30 will still be excluded from the vaccinations resuming on Monday because the benefits of the shot do not outweigh the risks for that age group, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said in a statement. Three vaccinated people in South Korea are reported to have developed blood clots, with one case determined to be correlated to the vaccine, Choi Eun-hwa, chair of the Korea Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices, told a briefing. That case was a type of blood clot considered less serious than the type being examined by European authorities, she said. For most people, the risks of COVID-19 are far worse than the rare possibility of side effects from the vaccines, Choi said, adding that the best way to end the pandemic was to vaccinate everyone who can receive it. But she said, \"the benefits are not as great for those under 30 years old, so we will not recommend the AstraZeneca vaccine for them.\". The AstraZeneca shot’s benefit-to-risk ratio rises the older people get as the risk of serious harm due to vaccination falls and ICU admissions prevented by vaccination rise sharply, according to the University of Cambridge’s Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication. The drugmaker has said its studies have found no higher risk of clots because of its vaccine, millions of doses of which have been administered worldwide. The World Health Organization has said the benefits outweigh the risks. Global controversy over the efficacy and side-effects of some COVID-19 vaccines has caused some delays in South Korea’s vaccination campaign, which kicked off in late February with the goal of reaching herd immunity in November. The second-quarter vaccination programme includes special disability school teachers and vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities and the homeless, the KDCA said. ​​​​​​", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162758", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "44385", "source": "scrapy"},

The Cambodia Microfinance Association (CMA) and the Association of Banks in Cambodia (ABC) made the announcement a day after more than 100 NGOs called on Cambodia’s government to direct MFIs and lenders to suspend debt and interest collection for at least three months to allow borrowers the ability to shelter at home as the country struggles to contain a viral spread first discovered in late February. Cambodia, which had largely remained unscathed by the coronavirus in 2020, registered its first death from COVID-19—the disease caused by the virus—last month, a year to the day that that the World Health Organization labeled it a pandemic. Since then, 22 people have died, and Cambodia’s caseload has reached more than 2,900 people. In Tuesday’s statement, the NGOs noted that borrowers are unable to avoid potential exposure to the coronavirus because they fear losing their land or homes if they cannot repay their debt. In particular, they pointed out that while lenders did temporarily suspend repayments of loan principals, they continued to collect interest accrual, allowing them to collect “record profits” during the past year. On Wednesday, the CMA and ABC said that around 340,000 people had been able to restructure loans totaling some U.S. $4 billion since the beginning of the pandemic and that they will continue to assist in restructuring loans based on their clients’ needs. Additionally, they said, clients who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who are in quarantine will be provided temporary forbearance from principal and interest payments. “Those customers who are infected with COVID-19 will not be charged interest or fined for at least one month and their loans will be automatically restructured,” the statement said. “They will also be allowed to delay principal payments for three months, provided they have proof of infection.” Clients in quarantine will be allowed to restructure their loans as well as delay interest and principal payments for one month, the associations said, adding that they will not be fined for late payments. The CMA and ABC also pledged to inject more funding in a bid to reduce interest rates, restructure loans and waive all fines for first-time homebuyers, and grant “forgiveness” to those who have died—without elaborating on how. CMA spokesman Kaing Tongngy told RFA’s Khmer Service in an interview on Wednesday that as the country’s Feb. 20 outbreak has gotten worse, his association has been working to introduce more measures to assist COVID-19 patients over the past few weeks. “If we know the customer has been impacted by COVID-19, we will reach out to them via telephone call and, with their consent, restructure their loans,” he said. Kaing Tongngy said that MFIs and banks consider their customers “long-term business partners,” and are therefore willing to take a loss to help them. “If they win over the customer’s hearts, the customers will continue to support their businesses in the future,” he said. Following the appeal by the more than 100 NGOs on Tuesday, government spokesman Phay Siphan told RFA that the requests were impossible to honor because “Cambodia is a free economic market.” He said debtors and creditors need to determine a path forward between themselves. “The people can’t rely on the government because they didn’t consult with us when they took the loans,” he said. “They need to be responsible for their own fates.”", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162802", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11670", "source": "scrapy"},

Additionally, given the nature and the spread of the virus, it is not just the students who will be at risk but also their teachers, invigilators and family members who are in contact with them.

A unilateral decision by any state would lead to students of that state being at a disadvantage in terms of career and opportunities, Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said in a letter, dated April 10, addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'. \"Your intervention would mean national consensus, instead of a unilateral decision by any particular state,\" Sawant said in his letter.

The White House on Friday said it was keeping a close watch on increased Chinese military activities in the Taiwan Strait, and called Beijing's actions potentially destabilising. Also on Friday, the US State Department issued new guidelines that will enable US officials to meet more freely with officials from Taiwan, a move that deepens relations with Taipei amid stepped-up Chinese military activity around the island. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the new guidelines had followed a congressionally mandated review and would \"provide clarity throughout the Executive Branch on effective implementation of our 'one China' policy\" - a reference to the longstanding US policy under which Washington officially recognises Beijing rather than Taipei. ", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162802", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "44404", "source": "scrapy"},

Tsai called the proposed law a serious threat to the freedom and judicial independence guaranteed to Hong Kong.

Even though Taiwan has no refugee protection laws that may be used to protect protesters, the country’s laws can intervene and help people whose safety and liberty are under threat. Taipei and Beijing share a historically strained relationship, and most anti-China sentiment, like the ongoing Hong Kong protests have received support across Taiwan. Hong Kong’s security chief on Monday referred to the protests as “terrorism”. “Terrorism is growing in the city and activities which harm national security, such as ‘Hong Kong independence’, become more rampant,” Secretary for Security John Lee said in a statement. “In just a few months, Hong Kong has changed from one of the safest cities in the world to a city shrouded in the shadow of violence,” he added.

The ultra-Maoist Pol Pot-led Khmer Rouge installed a reign of terror from 1975 to 1979 that left an estimated two million Cambodians dead from starvation, hard labour, torture and mass executions. The brutal regime took photographs of thousands of its victims, including those sent to Tuol Sleng or S-21, a former Phnom Penh high school which was converted into a prison. An estimated 15,000 people were interrogated and tortured there before being put to death in a neighbouring field. Artist Matt Loughrey has been adding colour to the black and white photos of victims as part of a personal project, but claims that he added smiles to some of those killed has provoked a backlash. A selection of the images and an interview with Loughrey was published on the Vice news website over the weekend, attracting a torrent of criticism both within Cambodia and social media. \"I'm talking with the museum about making these photos accessible to everybody,\" the artist said in the Vice interview, adding that the project had seen a \"superb response\" so far. The article appeared to have been pulled from the website on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, Vice added a disclaimer to the article before it was removed. \"It has been brought to our attention that the restored portraits published in this article were modified beyond colorization. We are reviewing the article and considering further actions to correct the record,\" Vice said in an editor's note. AFP has contacted Loughrey for a response. Norng Chan Phal, a S-21 survivor who lost parents at the prison, characterised Loughrey's project as \"an insult to the victims of Khmer Rouge\". \"I strongly condemn these colourised pictures because all victims at S-21 were never happy,\" Norng Chan Phal, 52, told AFP. \"We the victims who entered S-21 never had a chance to smile. I don't support any changes to the pictures. We were suffering.\" Cambodia's Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts said it considered Loughrey's manipulation of the images to \"seriously affect the dignity of the victims\" as well as the reality of the country's history. It said the Loughrey's project also violated the rights of the Tuol Sleng Genocide Musuem as the lawful owners and custodians of the images. The ministry called for Loughrey and Vice to remove the doctored pictures. \"(The ministry) will consider to take legal action (both national and international) if Matt Loughrey does not comply with the above request,\" the ministry said in a statement. Hun Many, a Cambodian lawmaker and youngest son of the country's leader Hun Sen said he was shocked to see the doctored images. \"It clearly shows that those individuals, especially foreigners do not understand the painful tragedy of the Cambodia nation and particularly the victims who suffered from torture and killings at Tuol Sleng prison,\" he wrote on Facebook.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162803", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "44612", "source": "scrapy"},

Ahead of the April 14-16 observation of the Cambodian New Year, or Choul Chnam Thmey, Hun Sen thanked King Norodom Sihamoni, the armed forces, civil servants, and the people of Cambodia for their support. He pledged to work on improving all aspects of the country, while ensuring peace, maintaining national integrity, protecting Cambodia’s territory, and preventing any interference in the nation’s internal affairs. “The government is strongly taking action against any color revolution attempts or incitement against the constitution and democratic principles that contribute to instability, including political and social chaos,” he said. “As a result, Cambodia has maintained its security, independence, national integrity, and territory, and avoided any unwarranted disaster.” Cambodia’s Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP in November 2017 and barred its members from taking part in political activities, two months after the arrest of party president Kem Sokha for his role in an alleged scheme to topple Hun Sen’s government. The ban, along with a wider crackdown on NGOs and the independent media, paved the way for Hun Sen’s ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in the country’s 2018 general election. Since then, dozens of CNRP officials and supporters have either fled abroad or been rounded up by authorities for “incitement” after expressing views critical of Hun Sen’s rule. The world’s longest-serving prime minister at 36 years, Hun Sen and his party stand virtually unopposed ahead of commune elections next year and general elections set for July 2023. Speaking to RFA’s Khmer Service on Thursday, Klaing Bunlay, the CNRP’s chief in Bangkok, Thailand, said that Hun Sen’s message is “meant to split Cambodian unity” because he is “afraid of the CNRP’s continued existence and influence.” He said that the opposition party continues to draw support because the people of Cambodia “want social justice.” “Hun Sen’s message does not come from the heart,” he said. “Hun Sen has ignored the needs of the people and persecuted them, actions which have caused pain.” Soeung Sengkaruna, spokesman for Cambodian rights group Adhoc, said that opposition and ruling party leaders should take the opportunity during Choul Chnam Thmey to exchange best wishes and work to resolve the country’s political stalemate. He said Hun Sen’s message could create more pressure, negatively impacting the people, economy, and the country’s development. “We don’t want to see any harm to Cambodia. We want to see a proper democracy, consisting of a power challenge through mutual understanding,” he said. “The winner should win with dignity and the loser should accept the results so that people can exercise their rights according to the constitution and the state can guarantee those rights.” Political analyst Kim Sok told RFA that Hun Sen’s message was also aimed at calming down a public that has endured difficult living conditions amid an economic downturn fueled by the country’s latest and deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus. He said that Choul Chnam Thmey is a time for Hun Sen to deliver a message of national reconciliation for the sake of people so that the country can work on restoring the economy when the pandemic ends. Cambodia, which had largely remained unscathed by the coronavirus in 2020, registered its first death from COVID-19—the disease caused by the virus—last month, a year to the day that that the World Health Organization labeled it a pandemic. Since then, 24 people have died, and Cambodia’s caseload has reached more than 3,000 people. Hun Sen’s address came as London-based rights group Amnesty International issued a scathing assessment of his governance in an annual report, highlighting an intensification in 2020 of what it called “extreme restrictions on civil and political rights implemented since 2017.” The group called out a controversial State of Emergency Law, enacted under the pretext of fighting the spread of the coronavirus, which it said, “severely impinges upon human rights.” Also in 2020, human rights defenders, peaceful demonstrators, and members of the CNRP continued to face harassment and intimidation through a justice system beholden to the government, while women’s rights came under “sustained attack” after Hun Sen led a campaign to punish those who did not adhere to an arbitrary interpretation of “tradition” and “culture.” “Members of the banned CNRP faced continued arbitrary criminalization and increasing levels of physical violence,” the group said. “Judicial harassment against former CNRP politicians and activists intensified in November as at least 126 CNRP-affiliated individuals were summoned in a series of politically-motivated mass trials on treason and incitement-related charges.” Amnesty noted that several CNRP officials and activists were the targets of severe physical assaults, and that authorities had failed to arrest or investigate anyone for the attacks. The group also slammed the country’s Law on Associations and NGOs (LANGO), which it said continued to be used to stifle freedom of association, as well as the arbitrary detention and physical assaults of environmental activists working to expose illegal logging by state authorities and corporate actors.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162802", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12555", "source": "scrapy"},

The Cambodian Youth Network (CYN) said in a news release that it had undertaken a 55-kilometer (34-mile) patrol of the Preah Roka Wildlife Sanctuary in the Preah Vihear province districts of Choam Ksan, Tbeng Meanchey, and Cheb from March 19-21, during which it recorded the 100 cases, mostly of rare and priceless timber. The logging included trees with cross-sections ranging from 45 centimeters (18 inches) to 1.5 meters (five feet) in areas of dense and semi-dense forest, and species such as Teal, Steang, Phteak, Popeal, Pechek, Odom, Korki, and Sokrom, the group said. In addition to targeting individual trees, perpetrators also burned and cleared certain areas of the forest, it said. Ma Chetra, a senior media official with the CYN, called the forest crimes “recent,” but said those responsible had yet to be identified. He expressed concern for the sanctuary because the Ministry of Environment has prevented his group from carrying out patrols, which is when the forest crimes took place. “When [the Ministry of Environment] stopped us, it was of no benefit to the ministry,” he told RFA’s Khmer Service. “There is no loss in letting us patrol the forest, but it is the nation that will lose by banning us from entering the forest because trees in protected areas are being cut down.” Ma Chetra urged the government to do a better job of policing the sanctuary and other protected areas in Cambodia. “Even if we or the Ministry of Environment patrol the forest from time to time, it won’t be enough to stop deforestation,” he said. “The only way to end the deforestation is to strictly enforce the law against perpetrators or those behind the crimes. If we want forest crimes to be prevented in Cambodia, the authorities must apply the law to those who trade in the trees.” Ministry of Environment spokesman Neth Peaktra refused to respond to the findings of the CYN, calling the group “not a lawful cooperative partner” with the ministry. He acknowledged that forest crimes do take place but called them small in number. Neth Peaktra added that any group is welcome to enter the forest, provided that it registers with the ministry ahead of time. Preah Roka Wildlife Sanctuary was designated by the Ministry of Environment as a 96,000-hectare (237,220-acre) conservation forest in 2016. Environmental activists say that the sanctuary has been subject to illegal logging operations for years, but that authorities have failed to take effective measures to prevent its destruction. CYN called on the Ministry of Environment to end restrictions on local communities, forest activists, associations, civil society organizations and the public from participating in patrolling, protecting, conserving and maintaining the forest, in accordance with the provisions on the rights and duties of citizens, as specified in Cambodia’s constitution and the Law on Protection of Nature. CYN’s call to action followed the March 26 release of a new report by the Geneva-based G​l​ob​a​l​ ​Initiative ​Against​ ​Trans​national​ ​Organize​d​ ​Crime, which found that Cambodia lost nearly 600,000 hectares (1.5 million acres), or nearly 12 percent, of forest coverage in the country’s protected areas between 2011 and 2018. The group said that such deforestation disproportionately impacts indigenous communities that rely on the collection of non-timber forest products. Thousands of trees were illegally destroyed in Preah Roka Wildlife Sanctuary and Prey Lang Wildlife Sanctuary in Kratie province and processed for export during the period, according to the report, which also found that deforestation in Cambodia had continued at an all-time high for the past decade. The deforestation is a result of Cambodia’s government investing in economic land concessions for private companies, granting social land concessions, and “re-forestation projects,” which the G​l​ob​a​l​ ​Initiative ​Against​ ​Trans​national​ ​Organize​d​ ​Crime said are granted to investors who typically convert land into profitable monoculture plantations that destroy the ecology of forests and impact local populations. Forest protection activist San Mala told RFA that the report shows the government must strengthen its protection of the country’s remaining forest and said economic land concessions adjacent to protected forests are often responsible for deforestation. “The government should accept the report to study, research and re-evaluate past projects to determine their positive and negative aspects,” he said. “What should be improved or strengthened, or what it should keep implementing.” Ministry of Environment spokesman Neth Pheaktra told RFA via social media that his ministry would not comment on the report. He said the ministry will continue to “enforce the law” and implement action plans in collaboration with community partners in protected areas for the purpose of protecting and conserving forest resources and wildlife. The G​l​ob​a​l​ ​Initiative ​Against​ ​Trans​national​ ​Organize​d​ ​Crime is a network of more than 500 experts from around the world who jointly researched the deforestation situation in Cambodia between 2018 and 2020. The experts documented their findings by visiting the sites for several weeks at a time, during which they met with locals and loggers to locate illegal logging. They use GPS and smartphones to record illegal logging activities, as well as drones to document large-scale logging in protected forests. The two forestry reports came as civil society groups and indigenous Phnong villagers criticized the Mondulkiri provincial court Friday for granting bail to military officer Touch Hoeun, who is accused of being the ringleader of a group of people who destroyed 53 hectares (131 acres) of indigenous Pou Treng village community forest last week. An indigenous villager named Kroeung Tola told RFA that Touch Hoeun is regularly involved in the destruction of community and public forests. He said his community has enough evidence and documentation to prove Touch Hoeun committed the crime, and that the court’s decision was unjust. “Touch Hoeun has been involved in many scandals in the province,” he said. Last week, more than 40 villagers stopped Touch Hoeun’s tractors from destroying the community forest and local authorities arrested him for allegedly faking documents granting him permission to raze the land. RFA was unable to reach provincial prosecutor Morm Vanda or Touch Hoeun for comment on Friday. However, court spokesman Meas Bros told RFA that the public is welcome to appeal the decision. “Please refer questions to the judge, because there must be a reason for his release,” he said. Pen Bunna, senior land and natural resources officer for local rights group Adhoc also criticized the court’s decision calling it a “double standard.” “This is a culture of impunity,” he said, adding that the court is regularly quick to punish the poor, but often delays cases against the wealthy and well-connected.

The southeast Asian nation may still have weapons at a \"historic\" facility where mustard gas was produced, a senior State Department official told the annual meeting of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Myanmar officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which bans the production, storage and use of chemical arms, in 2015. \"The US has serious concerns that a chemical weapons stockpile may remain at Myanmar's historical chemical weapons facility,\" Thomas DiNanno, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, told the OPCW in The Hague. Washington had information that Myanmar \"had a chemical weapons programme in the 1980s that included a sulphur mustard development programme and chemical weapons production facility\", he added. \"Based on available information, the United States certifies that Myanmar is in non-compliance with the CWC, due to its failure to declare its past chemical weapons programme and to destroy its chemical weapons facility.\" Myanmar has previously faced accusations of storing and using such weapons. In 2013, a parliamentary report said police had used phosphorus the previous year against protesters at a copper mine in the north of the country, causing severe burns. In July 2014, five journalists from Myanmar were sentenced to 10 years in prison with hard labour over an article accusing the military of producing chemical arms. The previous year, Myanmar's then quasi-civilian government denied using chemical weapons against rebels from the Kachin ethnic minority during clashes in the north of the country. The US official said Washington had held talks with Myanmar's civilian government and military over the issue and \"stands ready to assist Myanmar\" to destroy the weapons. Myanmar was the 191st State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which came into force in 1997 and is monitored by the OPCW for compliance. In 2005, London-based rights group Christian Solidarity Worldwide accused the former military junta of using chemical weapons against rebels from the Karen community. The US allegation comes as Myanmar faces growing international legal pressure over its treatment of another minority -- the Muslim Rohingya, thousands of whom were forced to flee to Bangladesh in a huge military operation in 2017. Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi is due to travel to the International Court of Justice in The Hague in December to lead the defence in a genocide case against Myanmar.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/11/04/115554-untitled-design.jpg?itok=LQhfr_pt\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162803", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21274", "source": "scrapy"},

The record-buying could also help India, the world's biggest producer of sugar, to cut stockpiles that are squeezing domestic prices. India had been the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil for five years, but purchases ground to a halt after the January curbs, a retaliation for then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad's criticism of New Delhi's policy regarding its Muslim minority. \"This year Malaysia was aggressively buying Indian raw sugar, which was a pleasant surprise,\" Praful Vithalani, president of the All India Sugar Trade Association (AISTA), told Reuters. The trade body's data shows Malaysia has imported 324,405 tonnes of sugar from India this year. That compares with India's exports last year of around 110,000 tonnes and a 2008 record of 313,406 tonnes, according to trade estimates. Malaysia imported a total of 1.95 million tonnes of raw sugar in 2019, data from the International Sugar Organization on Refinitiv Eikon shows. It typically buys more from Brazil and Thailand than from India. Kuala Lumpur's sugar purchases from India could easily surpass 400,000 tonnes in 2020, as some shipments are still in the pipeline, said a Mumbai-based dealer of a global trading house. Kuala Lumpur may have asked refiners to give preference to India in sugar purchases, said another Mumbai-based dealer, adding, \"It's an effort to please India.\" Both dealers sought anonymity as they were not allowed to speak with media. In January, MSM Malaysia Holdings Berhad, the southeast Asian nation's top sugar refiner, said it would buy 130,000 tonnes of raw sugar from India, worth 200 million ringgit ($49.20 million), in the first quarter. Malaysia has set itself a month's deadline to resolve the dispute over palm oil, its new Commodities Minister Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali said on Wednesday, adding that he wanted to send a delegation to India as soon as possible. \"Malaysia can show that it is buying more goods from India than Indonesia,\" a Mumbai-based refiner said, adding that higher imports of farm commodities would give Malaysia grounds to argue in negotiations that New Delhi should resume palm oil purchases. Indonesia is the world's biggest producer of palm oil, followed by Malaysia. India, hoping to reduce its vast surplus stocks of sugar, has approved an export subsidy of 10,448 Indian rupees ($142) per tonne of the sweetener for the marketing year that will end on September 30.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2020/03/12/132557-untitled-design-1.jpg?itok=T6E4IfC5\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162803", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21300", "source": "scrapy"},
