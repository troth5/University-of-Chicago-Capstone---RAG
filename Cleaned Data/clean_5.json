The DA for the central government employees will be put on hold till June 2021. While announcing the decision, the Centre said that they will continue to announce DA on time but it won't get added to central government employee's salary till June 2021. However, the three installments of DAs - January to June 2020, July to December 2020 and January to June 2021 - will be restored and they will be added to CGS' salary and it will further increase the monthly PF contribution or PF balance in the long term. How? Monthly Provident Fund (PF) contribution is calculated on the basis of a central government's basic salary plus DA. The DA hike will lead to rise in one's monthly PF contribution. As per the AICPI (All India Consumer Price Index) latest data, a 4 percent DA hike for January to June 2021, 3 percent DA for January to June 2020, and 4 percent DA for July to December 2020 can be expected to get added in central government employees' existing DA, which is currently at 17 percent. If the DA is not delayed anymore, then it can go up to 28 percent from 17 percent. The rise in DA from 17 percent to 28 percent will further increase the PF contribution and it will also make changes in the employees' monthly salary as monthly PF contribution is decided on the basis of one's basic salary plus DA. The 52 lakh central government employees along with 58 lakh retired central government employees or pensioners will also get Dearness Relief (DR) benefit restoration as the Centre has frozen both DA and DR till June 2021. Centre gives DR benefit to the retired central government employees to help them beat the heat of inflation.

Driven by state interests, Beijing’s plans for developing Tibet have left Tibetans “alienated and isolated from meaningful development and modernization,” says the report by the Dharamsala, India-based Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, “Distorted Development: Chinese Discourses on the Right to Development and its Implementation in Tibet.” “The international community has repeatedly condemned the Chinese government for their violations of human rights inside Tibet,” said TCHRD director Tsering Tsomo, speaking at a press conference in Dharamsala on Tuesday to announce the release of the report. “But the Chinese Communist Party has explicitly ignored this by highlighting what it calls the heightened Chinese model of development and infrastructure,” which it says is lifting Tibetans out of poverty in Tibet, Tsomo said. “The Chinese government insists that the economic welfare of the people is their most important right,” Tsomo said, adding, “However, they have threatened all other fundamental rights by making them subordinate to economic rights.” “And the government has also failed to provide any disaggregated data to show the number of Tibetans who are actually benefiting from this development,” she said. China’s development policies in Tibet are designed “to assimilate the region and its people into the framework of a single Chinese national identity rather than to meaningfully improve the lives of Tibetans,” TCHRD says in its report, pointing to the widespread forced removal of Tibetan herders from traditional grazing grounds. “Because China’s development policy has succeeded in urbanizing rural Tibetans and erasing their land rights, it has succeeded in creating pristine wilderness through depopulation, sinicizing economic centres in towns and cities ensuring investments and profits flow back to China Proper,” the rights group says. It has also built infrastructure, including highways and railways, to pull Tibet and its resources “closer to China, extracting natural minerals and resources, and building hydroelectric power to fulfill distant coastal China’s thirst for energy.” Bilingual education schemes that undermine the teaching of the Tibetan language have further disadvantaged Tibetans looking for employment in profitable sectors of the economy, while Tibetan herders forced from their land have been left unprepared for a shift to the modern job market now dominated by Chinese migrants, TCHRD says in its report. Preferential investment by China in Chinese companies in Tibetan urban areas has meanwhile ensured that profits flow out of Tibet and back to China, making Tibet a “remittance economy.” “In the future, as China accelerates and intensified efforts to move Tibetans to urban centres, this will mean a continued pattern of marginalization and alienation from economic opportunities that are already dominated by migrants,” TCHRD sayds. “Tibetans insufficiently prepared for the socioeconomic shift from rural living to the modern job market will continue to be relegated in job opportunities in favor of migrants, and directly marginalized by policy implemented in the name of development.” Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following a failed 1959 national uprising against Chinese rule. Chinese authorities maintain a tight grip on the region, restricting Tibetans’ political activities and peaceful expression of cultural and religious identity, and subjecting Tibetans to persecution, torture, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161951", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12475", "source": "scrapy"},

Hyderabad lost skipper David Warner (3) and Wriddhiman Saha (7) early and were always playing a catch-up game despite Jonny Bairstow's fighting half-century. They could manage 177 for five in the end.   Warner was dropped on nought by Pat Cummins in the first over bowled by Harbhajan Singh but he could not make good use of the life and became a victim of pacer Prasidh Krishna while Saha was cleaned up by Shakib Al Hasan. \r\nJonny Bairstow (55) and Manish Pandey (61 not out) formed a partnership at a steady run rate. Australian pacer Cummins broke their 92-run stand when he had Bairstow caught at backward point by Rana.     SRH needed 70 off the last five overs. Mohammed Nabi (14) was hit on his neck by Krishna but the Afghan responded with a cracking six. He went after a slower one but only to be caught by Eoin Morgan.   The 19-year-old Abdul Samad, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, creamed off two sixes and a four off Cummins in the penultimate over to keep SRH in hunt. Requiring 22 runs from the last over, KKR's Andre Russell held his nerves to deny SRH a win. Earlier, left-handed opener Rana struck the ball hard and clean to provide his side a confident start after they were asked to take first strike. \r\nHis strokes on the off-side -- the drives and cuts - were of highest quality and a treat to the eye. Neither Bhuvneshwar Kumar nor T Natarajan could stop Rana from hitting boundaries even as Subhman Gill was quiet initially. Sandeep Sharma was hit for three boundaries in a row by him.   Gill opened up his arms to hit a massive straight six off Natarajan to make it even better for KKR. However, the run-flow was affected when ever-reliable Rashid got the ball in his hands. He also provided the breakthrough when he deceived Gill with a wrong'un to find the stumps. Rana though kept going strong, completing his half-century with a six off Vijay Shankar after surviving an LBW appeal off Rashid. He got the decision overturned, taking the DRS call. Rana's six-hitting continued after getting his fifty as he punished Natarajan and Sandeep again.   His colleague at the other end Rahul Tripathi also stroked confidently and fluently. He smashed a massive six off Bhuvneshwar and then followed it up with a cheeky four in the third-man region. He completed his fifty with another boundary off Bhuvneshwar but was dismissed by Natarajan soon after when he top-edged a ball. Rashid too sent back dangerous Andre Russell (5) back. \r\nMohammed Nabi (2/32) got rid of Rana and Eoin Morgan (2) off successive balls in the 18th over.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161950", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16252", "source": "scrapy"},

Among those taken into custody are Tibetans suspected of sharing information on the deaths of Chinese soldiers killed in a border clash with India last June in the Galwan Valley of Ladakh, a source in Lhasa told RFA’s Tibetan Service on Monday. “The Chinese government has increased these arrests and crackdowns in Lhasa and in border areas,” RFA’s source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “And those who are suspected of exchanging information regarding the deaths of the Chinese soldiers on the border are immediately arrested.” “They have also deployed more blue-uniformed soldiers in Lhasa and in [Shigatse prefecture’s] Nyalam county,” an area located along the mountainous border with Nepal,” the source said, adding, “and authorities are stepping up their checks on the use of social media in Tibet these days.” Chinese authorities in Tibet maintain tight controls over information flows in the region, arresting Tibetans for sharing news and opinions on social media and for contacting relatives living in exile, sometimes with news of anti-China protests, according to rights groups and other experts. Particular targets of censors and police are images of exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama shared on mobile phones and calls for the preservation of the Tibetan language, now under threat from government orders to establish Chinese as the main language of instruction in Tibetan schools. China does not want reports of conditions inside Tibet to spread outside the country, Tsewang Dorjee, a researcher at the Dharamsala, India-based Tibet Policy Institute, told RFA. And with March 10, observed by Tibetans around the world as National Uprising Day, approaching in just a few days, “the authorities are putting more restrictions in place and cracking down even harder on Tibetans,\" Dorjee said. “And not only in Tibet, but also in China, the government has imposed tighter restrictions all around because there have been more criticisms from citizens on how the Chinese Communist Party handled the border dispute,” he said. “Though India quickly acknowledged the names and numbers of its dead on the border, China did not comment on its own casualties until February 2021,” Dorjee said. China regularly tightens security in Tibet’s regional capital Lhasa and in other Tibetan areas of China during important political gatherings in Beijing and in March, a month of politically sensitive anniversaries. On March 10, 1959, Tibetans in Lhasa rose up in protest of Beijing’s tightening political and military control of the formerly independent Tibet, sparking a rebellion in which thousands were killed. And on March 14, 2008, a riot in Lhasa followed the suppression by Chinese police of four days of peaceful Tibetan protests and led to the destruction of Han Chinese shops in the city and deadly attacks on Han Chinese residents. The riot then sparked a wave of mostly peaceful protests against Chinese rule that spread across Tibet and into Tibetan-populated regions of western Chinese provinces, and hundreds of Tibetans were detained, beaten, or shot as Chinese security forces quelled the protests. Formerly an independent nation, Tibet was invaded and incorporated into China by force nearly 70 years ago, and the Dalai Lama and thousands of his followers fled into exile in India and other countries around the world following the failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.

The Kim Il Sung Immortality Tower in the northwestern border city of Sinuiju is one of several such monuments that were built nationwide following the 1994 death of the national founder, grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un. The towers are adorned with slogans that proclaim the elder Kim, and sometimes his son and successor Kim Jong Il, as “eternal presidents” of the country. Authorities claim that Sinuiju is a hotbed for dissidents who would seek to deface the monument just before the country celebrates the “Day of the Sun” on the April 15 birth anniversary of Kim Il Sung, one of the most important holidays in the country. “Installation of the high-voltage electric fences began March 20 and was finished yesterday,” a resident of Sinuiju told RFA’s Korean Service April 3. “High-voltage electricity is flowing through the wire fence, which was installed in a hurry on the orders of the Central Committee [of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party]. It’s impossible for anyone to freely access the tower now,” said the source, who requested anonymity for security reasons. The source said the builders installed a door in the part of the fence facing nearby Chongnyon railway station so that people can enter to lay flowers at the tower on April 15 and other holidays. “The authorities suddenly installed a high-voltage electric wire fence and creating an atmosphere of fear surrounding this important landmark because forces resisting the regime could potentially appear in the Sinuiju area.” “Since last year, there have been dozens of officials who have been executed, removed from the party, or dismissed for corruption or failing to follow quarantine orders here in North Pyongan province. So it is natural for the leadership to feel uneasy,” said the source. Another source, a resident of nearby Ryongchon county, told RFA April 4 that Kim Jong Un has been focused on eliminating corruption in the country’s powerful institutions. “He has executed or removed core officials, including the principal of Kim Il Sung Higher Party School, and members of the party,” said the second source, who requested anonymity to speak freely. “Most of the purged officials were from the party and administrative agencies in North Pyongan province,” the second source said. Corruption is a way of life for those wielding government power in North Korea. Unable to survive on paltry government salaries, officials are bribed to look the other way by those engaged in illegal activities like smuggling or making illegal international phone calls. Those in higher positions often run the illegal businesses themselves. “Last year a bunch of customs officers from the Sinuiju office were arrested and executed for their corruption, but the purge that really hit home was that of the Kim Il Sung Higher Party School principal, as he was a native of the province,” the second source said. “Even after the Sinuiju customs officers were quickly replaced, government officials in Sinuiju were in turmoil as the provincial party secretary and the head of the security department suddenly disappeared one day. Authorities continue to purge senior officials, and they are saying they want to catch potential dissidents in the North Pyongan area including Sinuiju,” the second source said. A number of officials and residents in the province have been turned against the country’s leadership due to the ongoing purges, according to the second source. “The authorities are creating an atmosphere equivalent to a quasi-state of war by installing high-voltage fences around the Kim Il Sung Immortality Tower. They are trying to tell residents to prepare for contingencies because they don’t know what will happen in Sinuiju.” “We know that the fences will be installed in the parts of the city that border China sooner or later.” A North Korean defector who used to be a high-ranking official in Pyongyang told RFA that Sinuiju is a particularly dangerous part of the country watched closely by the government. “Dissident forces have been deep-rooted there since the Kim Il Sung era [1948-1994]. Authorities are very careful about who they appoint as secretaries for the provincial government and the city party up there,” the former official said. “Even when they investigated the [2004] Ryongchon train explosion disaster, which failed to assassinate Kim Jong Il, the authorities presumed it had been carried out by government officials in Sinuiju and so they first investigated the officials and related people.” Then-leader Kim Jong Il had passed through Ryongchon station on his way back from China just hours before the disaster, which killed about 3,000 people and was caused by “electrical contact caused by carelessness during the shunting of wagons loaded with ammonium-nitrate fertilizer,\" according to state media. Though there was widespread speculation that the disaster was a failed assassination attempt, South Korean intelligence has said it believes the event to have been an accident in a country with a poor industrial safety record and few resources to maintain infrastructure. South Korean lawmaker Thae Yong Ho, a senior North Korean diplomat before he defected, told the South Korean media in 2017 that Kim Jong Il ordered the executions of transportation officials including the country’s railway chief following the 2004 disaster. According to the former Pyongyang official, North Pyongan province has produced many well-known people and organizations opposed to the North Korean government or communism in general, including the late religious leader Moon Sung Myung, who fled to South Korea during the Korean War and founded the Unification Church. The Seoul-based  online newspaper reported in late March that North Korea has begun building electric fences along the Sino-Korean border in Chagang province, with plans to cover the entire 880-mile border. According to that report, Kim Jong Un ordered the fences as a measure to prevent illegal border crossers from bringing the coronavirus into the country.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161954", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13236", "source": "scrapy"},

The 57-year-old Black woman from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, feared that her high blood pressure and diabetes might heighten her chances of a severe reaction to the shot. The speedy development and approval of the vaccines also fed her skepticism. Then a member of Pringle’s church, a local NAACP leader who has led a vaccination campaign targeting Black residents, urged her to reconsider. He shared a news story about Kizzmekia Corbett, a Black government scientist who played a key role in developing the Moderna vaccine. “That’s what made me change my mind,” said Pringle, who finally agreed to an appointment to get her first   shot Thursday. “I had to pray about it. And I felt better after that.” Campaigns aimed at Black communities across the US are making headway in the effort to persuade people that the   vaccines are safe and effective. With millions of dollars in assistance from President Joe Biden’s administration, local groups have urged Black Americans to roll up their sleeves for shots and set aside what for some is a shared historical distrust of science and government. A poll by   for Public Affairs Research in late March found that about 24 percent of Black American adults said they will probably or definitely not get vaccinated. That’s down from 41 percent in January. The latest number shows Black Americans leaning against getting shots in almost the same proportion as white Americans at 26 percent and Hispanic Americans at 22 percent. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said attitudes toward the vaccine among Black Americans have taken “almost a 180-degree turnaround” as outreach campaigns have worked to combat misinformation. He credited Black physicians, faith leaders and other community organisers for being trusted messengers during the pandemic, which has killed more than 5,50,000 Americans. “It’s the messenger and the message,” but the messenger “is probably the most important part of it, and people doing it in a way that wasn’t preachy,” Benjamin said. “They didn’t tell people, ‘You need to get vaccinated because it’s your duty.’ They basically said, ‘Listen, you need to get vaccinated to protect yourself and your family.’” Some of the most effective outreach has relied on existing community relationships, such as local physicians talking about their own decisions to get vaccinated, to reassure the public, said Dr Lisa Cooper, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity. Community members in the Baltimore area who knew Cooper from her research on food deserts and nutrition trusted her as a source of information on   , she said. Based on that relationship, “people felt comfortable hearing from me,” she said. Some state health departments have rolled out ads targeting communities of color. NAACP chapters in some cities have booked appointments for people to get shots. Pastors of Black churches have urged their parishioners to take the vaccines. In Brunswick, Georgia, the Rev John Perry and another Black pastor put their faces on a billboard promoting the vaccines, and postcards with a similar image were mailed to residents. Both efforts were produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. “I think we still have enough people on the fence that are going to budge and get their shots,” said Perry, who initially wanted to wait a year before getting his shots but changed his mind after reading up on how the vaccines were developed. He got his second dose Wednesday. Jason Pettibone, a Black barber in Perry’s coastal Georgia community, remains hesitant. His parents and sister have all been vaccinated with no ill effects. Yet Pettibone said the stories he hears from customers — including one who swore his father lost all feeling in the right side of his body after getting a shot — have made it hard to overcome his uncertainty. “I’m thinking in my head not only would it be good for me to get it, because I don’t want to get sick myself, but also to protect other people who come into the shop,” Pettibone said. “But it’s the unknown. Everybody’s really scared of the unknown.” In Savannah, Georgia, community activist Natavia Sanders said outreach efforts can backfire with some in the Black community who suspect the government is targeting them as test subjects rather than seeking to protect their health. Some of that skepticism can be traced to an infamous study in Tuskegee, Alabama, where the government let hundreds of Black men suffer untreated syphilis for 40 years for research purposes. Sanders declined to say whether she was getting vaccinated. She said she’s spoken with several people who had to be hospitalised with   but still have doubts about the vaccines. “That’s how skeptical people are,” Sanders said. “They’re like, ‘No, I’ll fight it myself.

The 88-year-old Black woman said she doesn’t understand why she needs to get vaccinated if she’s not sick or around sick people. Still, she agreed to get her shot. She said she thinks vaccinations will eventually be required, and she wants to be able to continue to socialise at a local senior center. “If you ain’t got nothing, why do we need to take it?” Browner said. “But we’ll take it because later on, they’ll say, ‘You’ve got to take it.’ If you don’t, later on, I think we’ll have to.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" alt=\"Amid skepticism, campaigns aimed at Black Americans across US persuade people to take the COVID-19 vaccine\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pfizer-vaccine-640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161954", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "44667", "source": "scrapy"},

An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited all types of gatherings, reduced the size of weddings and funerals, cut seating in public transport and restaurants to half and scaled down presence in government offices. It, however, allowed students of class IX-XII to be called to schools for guidance by teachers. Except this, all Delhi government and private schools will remain closed till April 30, the order said.   Funerals will be allowed to be attended by 20 persons only while gatherings for marriages will have an upper limit of 50 persons. Restaurants and bars are allowed up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity, stated the order. The Delhi Metro will run at 50 per cent of coach capacity. The DTC and Cluster buses too will run at half their capacity, stipulated the order. A negative RT-PCR report, not older than 72 hours prior to undertaking a journey, will be compulsory for persons arriving from Maharashtra to Delhi by air. Those found without a negative report will have to remain quarantined for 14 days, the order said.    Delhi on Saturday had 7,897 new Covid-19 cases and 39 deaths. The city’s positivity rate is over 10 per cent. In order to meet the increased demand for manpower during the ongoing pandemic, the Delhi government has directed hospitals to engage 4th and 5th year MBBS students, interns and BDS doctors. In Maharashtra, during the all-party meeting called by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday, it was decided that a lockdown of minimum one week and maximum 15 days can be imposed in the state to break the chain of transmission of novel coronavirus. However, a final decision in this regard will be taken in a couple of days after consulting health experts.    The Centre too is yet to give its nod for such a plan as the Union government had suggested that states go for “micro-level” lockdowns instead of shutting down the entire state. Mr Thackeray said lockdown is the only option given the high volume of cases and difficulty in contact tracing. “Last year during lockdown people were at home so it was not difficult to trace the infection. Since everything is open now, it is practically very difficult to trace people. The Centre must understand this. I have been speaking to many people from different sectors, even private hospitals for the last few days. All are ready to support the government,” Mr Thackeray said.   Maharashtra on Saturday reported 55,411 fresh Covid-19 positive cases with 309 deaths. Out of this, Mumbai had 9,327 new cases and 50 deaths. In a new high, India reported over 1.45 lakh fresh cases of novel coronavirus with 794 deaths in 24 hours on Saturday. Among the latest to catch infection in Maharashtra is RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. The rising cases have put substantial pressure on the health infrastructure of the country with several states reporting shortage of Remdesivir, Oxygen and hospital beds. As state governments scramble to test and treat Covid patients, there were also reports of shortage of RT-PCR kits in some places.   In a crackdown on black-marketeers and hoarders, Maharashtra on Saturday arrested four persons for selling 40 Remdesivir injections in black market from Pimpri Chhindwara. Police are probing the presence of other gangs that might be operating in different hospitals. In Thane, the crime branch recovered 21 Remdesivir injections and arrested two persons. In Madhya Pradesh, oxygen demand has gone up by 60 per cent and the state has set up a committee to audit oxygen availability in hospitals. In Indore, the lockdown has been extended from Monday to Friday.   In Tamil Nadu, beaches in Chennai, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur districts will remain closed to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays from April 11. However, religious places in these three districts will remain open for devotees till 10 pm. Meanwhile, chief ministers of Congress governed states held a meeting with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161954", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18003", "source": "scrapy"},

Prosecutors are now filing charges against the man, the owner of the Guestown-Lao company, whose plant in the province’s Nam Bak district was closed in late November, a labor official in Luang Prabang told RFA on Thursday. “The owner of the plant is a Chinese, who has now been detained,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “The authorities are filing charges against him, and he will be brought to court soon,” he said. “The workers will now have to wait for a court decision to see if they will be paid,” he added. The shuttered Guestown-Lao company plant, which has now reopened under new owners, owes about 400 million kip (U.S. $42,500) in back pay to more than 200 employees, only some of whom have been rehired by the plant’s new managers. “The same plant with a new Chinese owner and a new company called Jiang Qe Co. called me and several others back to work, and we have been working here again since late February, one worker said. “The new owner told us that this is a different company that has nothing to do with the previous one, so we are still going to have to wait for our unpaid wages,” he said. Another worker said he remains unemployed, but can’t travel far from his home to find a new job. “My family is poor, and I can’t go to another town or province to work because I’m still waiting for my back pay,” he said, adding, “We haven’t heard anything from the authorities up till now.” “This was not the first time that the company didn’t pay us,” a third worker said, also speaking to RFA. “The plant paid us late several times before, and they only paid then because we protested.” Around 100 of the cement plant’s more than 200 unpaid workers gathered on Feb. 22 outside the home of the plant’s Chinese owner to demand their wages, sources told RFA in an earlier report, with one worker saying the owner had fled his home before they arrived. “We came here several times in December and January to ask for our back pay, but nothing happened. Then, in early February, we filed a written complaint with the district and provincial labor departments and with the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare,” the worker said. “We waited for almost a month, and nothing happened, so we came here to protest on Feb. 22,” he said. Reports have increased in recent years of the high-handed treatment of Lao workers by their Chinese bosses, and of increasing resentment over a rapidly growing Chinese business presence in the country. A Lao teenager working at a motorcycle shop in Bokeo province killed his Chinese employer in early March following a heated argument over working hours and the man’s abuse of his local employees, while in June 2020 a young Lao worker was beaten, shocked, and tied up by his supervisors at a Chinese banana plantation in Vientiane province. Concern has also been growing in Laos over China’s growing influence as a result of its massive investment in hydropower dams, a major railway, and other infrastructure projects under Beijing’s $1.3 trillion Belt and Road Initiative. China is Laos’ largest foreign investor and aid provider, and its second-largest trade partner after Thailand. Lao authorities announced on Thursday that China had donated 800,000 doses of the Sinopharm coronavirus vaccine to its communist neighbor.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161954", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12175", "source": "scrapy"},

The flip flop came a day after the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet had given approval for import of white sugar from India up to 500,000 metric tonne till June 30, and import of cotton till the date.  Restoration of special status for the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir has been a key issue for Islamabad vis a vis import of sugar and cotton.  Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said, \"Cabinet deferred the decision, till India reverses the 5th August decision of 2019, till that time it won't be easy to normalise the things\". Pakistani Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid, speaking to reporters after the Cabinet meet, said, \"We have deferred the import of sugar and cotton till India reverses its decision of removal of Article 370 from Kashmir\". India had removed article 370 or special status for the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. As a reaction to it, Islamabad recalled its envoy from New Delhi, cut trade ties and people-to-people relationship by suspending train and bus services.  Pakistani government sources told WION that Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari, Sheikh Rashid, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Finance Minister Asad Umar had opposed the proposal by ECC on imports from India, which led to the matter being deferred in the federal Cabinet meeting. Earlier today, sources in Delhi told WION they were fine with Pakistan's decision to import sugar and cotton from India. Pakistan doesn't require any permission to import from India as New Delhi hasn't banned exports to Pakistan. The development comes even as there has been some positive sentiment by both Delhi and Islamabad.  Earlier this year, militaries of both the countries came up with a joint statement for observance of the 2003 ceasefire pace at Line of Control. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Pakistan's National Day on March 23, to which the latter replied.

A Russian demining team has been working with Lao counterparts to clear the UXO since Dec. 5, 2020, the provincial officials recently told RFA’s Lao Service, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans with the media. “The Russians came here to build a military airport on the other side of the Plain of Jars,” one of the officials said, referring to the archeological landscape in the Xieng Khouang Plateau that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019. “They’re currently clearing the UXO and then they’re going to upgrade the existing airport, making it larger and more beautiful.” Another Xieng Khouang official, who is a provincial military officer, provided further details about the new airport to RFA. “The Russian and Lao armed forces together are building this new airport that will be larger than the existing one and will be divided in two different zones,” he said. “One zone is for Lao and Russian military use and the other is for civilian use.” The officer said that the Russian military intends to provide substantial assistance to Laos going forward, including with training and developing the latter’s armed forces. “Some work on the new airport has already begun, but the actual construction will not start anytime soon because the UXO clearance will take some time,” he said. “Once the UXO has been cleared, we’ll lay underground powerlines. We’ll do our work step by step.” Besides the airport, the Russians intend to expand military cooperation with Laos that will include building a facility to train Lao troops on how to use Russian military equipment, according to a report by Russian news agency Sputniknews.com. A former senior government official in Laos told RFA that the two sides are expanding cooperation in line with an agreement they have in place on security and defense, as well as the new airport. “In the agreements, most cooperation would include training and teaching military techniques to the Lao armed forces,” said the former official, who also declined to be named. “We had more cooperation and more Russian military presence in Laos during the Soviet era,” he added. RFA spoke with an official at the Lao Ministry of Foreign Affairs who claimed not to know anything about the Russian military aid projects. In 2018, Laos ordered four jet fighters and 10 Yak-130 tanks from Russia following a state visit to Moscow by Laos’ then-Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith a year earlier, during which the two nations signed a military cooperation agreement. Four of the tanks were later delivered to the Lao Ministry of Defense by Russia’s Rosoboronexport Company and took part in a 2019 parade commemorating the 70  anniversary of the Lao People’s Armed Forces in the capital Vientiane. In April 2019, Russia’s TASS news agency reported that the Russian and Lao defense ministries had agreed on the areas of expanding military cooperation between their two countries on the sidelines of the Moscow International Conference on International Security, citing Lao Defense Minister Chansamone Chanyalath. The report did not provide details of the agreement. In June last year, Laos unveiled plans to build statues to honor two unnamed Soviet pilots who died while serving in the Southeast Asian country, angering citizens who said the U.S. $775,000 earmarked for the project could be better spent on recovering from the coronavirus pandemic. The pilots were in Laos as part of Moscow’s military presence in the fellow communist country between 1975 and 1992 and are believed to have been involved in training pilots in Laos’ air force. An official from the Ministry of Information Culture and Tourism told RFA at the time that the pilots were killed in a crash over Xieng Khouang province while on a practice mission. According to a report on the Lao Defense Ministry website, Chansamone Chanyalath met with Russian ambassador to Laos Vladimir Kalinin at the Russian Embassy in Vientiane on Dec. 29, 2020 and thanked him for Russia’s gift of a hangar to store tanks in Xieng Khouang province. Chansamone also expressed gratitude for joint military exercises held in the province in 2019, Russia’s assistance with UXO clearance, its work in upgrading the airport in Xieng Khouang, and for building an office of the Russian Military Representative in the province. The meeting took place a week after Russia’s military donated an air force training center to Laos. Moscow was a major arms supplier to Laos after its communist government, closely associated with the Soviet-aligned communist government in Vietnam, was established in 1975. According to a January report in   recent aid to Laos highlights the country’s importance in Russia’s desire for broader defense cooperation in Southeast Asia. Russia has provided various forms of assistance to Laos in recent years. In January, TASS cited Russian Ambassador Kalinin as saying that Moscow and Vientiane had agreed on deliveries of two million doses of Russia’s homegrown Sputnik V vaccine, which would be used to inoculate around 25 percent of the Lao population against the coronavirus.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"laos-russian-base.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/laos/laos-russian-base.jpg/@@images/132b471c-7101-45c1-a9bf-ffb8c02d72f6.jpeg\" title=\"laos-russian-base.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161959", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12340", "source": "scrapy"},

They are all worried that the villages would be submerged in June or July because of cyclones and floods. They appealed to the Union and state governments to provide a relief and resettlement package to them, before the completion of Polavaram Project. According to them, nearly 3.5 lakh people, from Schedule Tribe and Scheduled Caste, are facing a threat of their livelihood. According to sources, the government completed 70 per cent of Polavaram project works by the end of December but only four percent of the R & R package was implemented. The Chief Minister aimed at completing the project by the year-end.   As per the 2017 statistics, 5,08,874 persons have been displaced and the number may increase. The state government had announced that 371 villages will be submerged due to the project and CCLA has given permission for providing R&R package to 164 villages. However, only 15 villages have been given partial R&R packages. \r\nIndian Association of Lawyers state executive member Inapurapu Suryanaryana said that the Comptroller and Audit General (CAG) found fault with the project as there is no MoU between Centre and the state government on construction of Polavaram project and advised the state government to reach a truce with the Union Government for the sake of the project.   To avoid submergence problems, the Centre advised state governments of Odisha and Chhattisgarh to construct protection walls at eight and four places, respectively. But, either has obliged. He said that the Union Government has also not taken any steps to have cases filed in the Supreme Court to be withdrawn by Odisha and Chhattisgarh. SC, ST vigilance and monitoring committee district member Ayithabathula Rameswara Rao demanded the government to halt Polavaram project works till the completion of R&R package works to 371 villages. He said that the ST Commission recommendations have not been implemented by the governments so far.   Adivasi maha sabha district secretary Karam Venkateswara Rao said that tribal people should be given fertile lands as compensation. The government should provide livelihood to people who will lose their forest products. He demanded the government should make a fresh integrated survey on the number of displaced persons and families under the project under New Land Acquisition Amendment Act, as the socio economic survey was last done in 2005 and there were no environmental clearance for the project till 2009.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161959", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "16803", "source": "scrapy"},

At stake is the future of a company which has been at the heart of manufacturing in Britain for more than 100 years, making engines that powered World War Two bombers and still drive the country’s fighter jets and nuclear submarines. Investors are expected to back the rights issue, supporting CEO Warren East’s plan to cut 9,000 jobs and close factories to adjust to a lower level of demand from airline customers that fly with Rolls engines on Boeing 787s and Airbus 350s. Shareholder advisory groups Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have both urged clients to back the fundraising. “We find the terms of the proposed rights issue to be reasonable,” Glass Lewis said in a note, while ISS said the rationale was “compelling”. Investors can buy 10 new shares for every three they own at 32 pence each, a 41% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price. The company, which made a 5.4 billion pound loss in the first half of 2020, faces a cash crunch at the end of next year, when 3.2 billion pounds of debt needs to be repaid. In a sign of Rolls’s strategic importance, the UK government has guaranteed a 1 billion pound loan on top of the 2 billion pounds it backed in July through its UK Export Finance arm. Rolls accounts for 2% of all UK goods exported and is one of the country’s biggest spenders on research and development.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) hailed Azizbek Ashurov for helping Kyrgyzstan to become the world's first country to end statelessness, working through his organisation Ferghana Valley Lawyers Without Borders (FVLWB). He has helped more than 10,000 people gain Kyrgyz nationality after they became stateless following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the agency said in a statement. \"I cannot stand still when I see an injustice,\" Ashurov said in the statement. \"Statelessness is injustice\". \"A stateless person is not recognised by any state,\" he said. \"They are like ghosts. They exist physically, but they don't exist on paper.\" Ashurov will receive his award at a ceremony in Geneva next Monday. Thanks to his work, around 2,000 children have been handed a right to education, and a future in which they will be free to travel, marry and work, UNHCR said. \"Azizbek Ashurov's story is one of great personal resolve and tenacity,\" UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said in the statement.  \"His commitment to the cause of eradicating statelessness in Kyrgyzstan ... is a compelling example of the power of an individual to inspire and mobilise collective action,\" he added.  Ashurov was motivated by his own family's struggle to achieve Kyrgyz citizenship after arriving from Uzbekistan. During the Soviet era, there were no internal borders, and people moved across Central Asia with only internal documentation. But after the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, \"many people became stranded across newly established borders, often with now-invalid Soviet passports or no means to prove where they were born,\" the UNHCR noted. This left hundreds of thousands of people stateless throughout the region, including in Kyrgyzstan. Statelessness, which affects millions worldwide, leaves people politically and economically marginalised, often discriminated against and particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, according to UNHCR. In the former Soviet Union, women were disproportionately affected by the problem, since they had been more likely to move to marry. And due to hereditary citizenship laws, their statelessness was passed on to their children, UNHCR said. Ashurov helped found Ferghana Valley Lawyers Without Borders (FVLWB) in 2003 to provide free legal advice and assistance to stateless and undocumented people in the southern part of the country. He and FVLWB formed mobile legal teams which travelled to remote areas of the south of the country, sometimes on horseback, to find vulnerable and socially marginalised groups. The Nansen prize, awarded annually, is named for Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen, who served as the first High Commissioner for refugees during the failed League of Nations. Last year's winner was South Sudanese doctor Evan Atar Adaha, who runs an overcrowded hospital to service refugees from Blue Nile State.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2019/10/02/112022-untitled-design-7.jpg?itok=hxaVFa74\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 161959", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21743", "source": "scrapy"},

Among the eight confirmed victims were former first lady Keosaiychai Xayasone and former Vientiane province Gov. Vidong Xayasone the wife and son of Choummaly Xayasone, who served as president from 2006 to 2016. The former president was among 40 survivors. The accident occurred at about 8 a.m. in the middle of the Nam Ngeum reservoir. Xayasone and his family had just left a family event at the nearby Chinese-owned-and-operated Dansavanh Resort and Casino. According to initial reports from the provincial government and a local rescue team, the number of passengers and crew was believed to be 39, of which rescuers were able to save 31. They also recovered eight bodies. A member of the rescue team told RFA's Lao Service Monday that according to the latest figures, 40 of 48 survived the accident.  “During the search operation, the conditions were still harsh. It was still raining and the winds were gusting. It took us some time to get from the shore to the scene of the accident.

According to the official, the water level in Bokeo was at 2.52 meters (99.2 inches) on April 2. “I think the Chinese dams might be releasing water, but I’m not sure because I’ve not been officially informed,” the official said. Fluctuating water levels in Southeast Asia’s most important waterway pose threats to aquatic plants and fish, which thousands of people living along the Mekong in Laos rely on for their livelihood. A fisherman from Laos’ northwestern Xayaburi province told RFA that a sudden change in water level was bad for fish stocks. “The Mekong River has risen about 10 centimeters [four inches]. I’m concerned that the rising water will affect aquatic vegetation and fish,” the fisherman said. “Before, the water was thick and rich in sediment. Now it is clear and has fewer fish. The fish are reproducing less and less these days. During this time of year, the fish lay their eggs, but when the water rushes through, it washes them all away,” said the fisherman. A farmer from the same province said the unpredictable water levels made his work difficult. “The water level depends on Chinese dams, and the waterflow is not natural. It’s hard to make a living on the river these days,” the farmer said. In the capital Vientiane, a vegetable garden owner told RFA that the increased water level was good for some industries but bad for others. “The water level is up by about one ladder step over the past two days. That’s good for boat navigation, but bad for fishing and vegetable planting. I grow peanuts on a sand bed that is about to be flooded,” the gardener said. Montree Chanthawong, a Thailand-based Mekong River expert, told RFA that the river’s water level is not supposed to rise during the dry season. “The rising water could hurt aquatic species like fish and aquatic vegetation. Some of them could even die. Sparrows lay their eggs on the sand beds too, and when the water level rises these can become flooded,” he said. Nowat Roykaew, the president of the Thailand-based Chiang Khong Conservation Group, told RFA that water levels in the Mekong have been fluctuating since January. “Sometimes it goes up a lot like right now. I notice that the rising water is now clear. That means the water is coming from Chinese dams, because if it came from rain, it would be turbid. The water fluctuation has broken down the whole eco-system,” he said. Data from the Washington-based Stimson Center’s Mekong Dam Monitor project indicated that during the week of March 29 to April 4, five Chinese dams released water. Don Sahong Dam in southern Laos also released water during the same period. During its update for the week of March 22-28, the Monitor said that river levels at Chiang Saen, Thailand had continued to rise. “This is not normal for this time of the year and is a result of significant upstream dam releases from China's cascade,” the update said, adding that releases would likely continue in the coming months. The update also reported that Thai conservationists had recently posted photos of migratory bird nests and eggs along the riverbanks to show that a 50 cm (20 inch) rise in the water level would submerge the nests. “That rise is likely to come over the next month given upstream releases. This is just one example of how altering the river's natural cycle of dry season lows and wet season highs is killing the river's natural resource base,” the update said. China has drawn criticism from its downstream neighbors for its cascade of 11 mega-dams on the Mekong River, with the lower Mekong basin experiencing severe drought over the past year and some stretches of the river even drying up entirely. In October 2020, Beijing agreed to share data with the Mekong River Commission, as some 60 million people in MRC members Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam use the river for agriculture and fishing. Neighbors of Laos have also complained about its nearly 80 dams on the Mekong River and its tributaries under the country’s controversial economic strategy to become the “Battery of Southeast Asia” by selling hydropower to neighbors.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162000", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11852", "source": "scrapy"},

Benchmarks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul all retreated. Shanghai swung between gains and losses. Investors have been dismayed by the lack of progress in talks between the White House and Congress on new U.S. stimulus. Hopes for action ahead of Tuesday’s election and potential wrangling over the outcome have diminished. The market is still in search of that elusive stimulus lifeline in this mishmash of pre-election de-risking, said Stephen Innes of Axi in a report. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 0.8% to 23,146.37 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.3% to 24,521.86. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.2% to 3,272.94 at mid-morning after the ruling Communist Party said it will try to speed up China’s development as a self-reliant technology power as a feud with Washington hampers access to high-tech components. The Kospi in Seoul retreated 0.9% to 2,305.18 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 was 0.4% lower at 5,934.70. New Zealand and Singapore also declined. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.2% to 3,310.11, helped by a rebound for tech stocks as the market steadied after its worst drop in four months. The index fell 3.5% on Wednesday on worries an upsurge in coronavirus infections could drag down the economy again. Traders welcomed data that showed the number of US workers applying for unemployment benefits eased last week to 751,000. That was down from the previous week’s 791,000 and better than economists expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, to 26,659.11. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 1.6% to 11,185.59. In Washington, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin listing topics in their stimulus negotiations on which she is awaiting a reply. They include benefits for laid-off workers and measures on coronavirus testing. Also Thursday, the head of the European Central Bank said there’s little doubt it will deliver more stimulus in December. In China, the ruling party said Thursday its next five-year development plan starting next year will emphasize self-reliance in technology. The party gave no details but aid to technology developers could help Chinese makers of smartphones and other products that face possible difficulty in obtaining US components after the Trump administration imposed export restrictions in a fight over security, spying and Beijing’s development plans. Coronavirus case numbers are rising in the United States and Europe, increasing worries that restrictions on business might be reimposed. Retailers worry customers might stay away even if sweeping lockdowns don’t come back. In energy markets, benchmark US crude gained 33 cents to 36.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 1.22 on Thursday to 36.17. Brent crude, the price standard for international oils, rose 34 cents to 38.60 per barrel in London. It lost 1.47 the previous session to 37.65. The dollar declined to 104.46 yen from Thursday’s 104.67 yen.

{"website": "www.asian-times.com", "section": "Sports", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.asian-times.com/questioning-messis-future-between-barcelona-disruption/", "title": "Questioning Messi’s future between Barcelona disruption.", "author": "Mahi Sharma", "author_link": "https://www.asian-times.com/author/mahi/", "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Barcelona is on the verge of announcing a new coach, and it may have a new president next year. The club is also promising “wide-ranging” and “profound” structural changes after one of its most humiliating defeats ever the 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals of the Champions League on Friday. The one big question that remains is whether it will be able to keep Lionel Messi. The team’s biggest star for more than a decade has a contract with Barcelona until 2021, but he hasn’t been hiding his dissatisfaction with the club. “I haven’t spoken with Messi but I talked to his father,” Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu told Bar a TV on Tuesday. “Messi is disappointed and frustrated, just like everyone else. It was painful but we have to pick ourselves up. It’s what we all have to do.” Messi has been more outspoken than ever this season, talking about the team’s problems and pointing to poor decisions by club directors. Although he has never really hinted about leaving, his recent actions have raised doubts about his future. “Football is a game that comes and goes very quickly in your life, so this next two years, where he’s still going to have the power to influence games the way he does, is he going to want to be doing that not really competing for the big titles? I don’t know,” former player Rio Ferdinand said. Spanish media has reported that negotiations to extend Messi’s contract beyond next June have been on hold since the problems at the club escalated. One Brazilian outlet, Esporte Interativo, said Messi actually wants to leave now instead of waiting until next year. Rumors of clubs wanting to sign Messi started to surface immediately after the team’s loss to Bayern, with Pep Guardiola-coached Manchester City   among the front-runners. Many think the humiliation against Bayern may have been the tipping point for the Argentina great. Messi looked like he had already given up at halftime, when images showed him sitting at one end of the bench looking down and biting his nails while waiting to go back on the field. Messi and his teammates had to face furious Barcelona fans who confronted them and criticized the team at the club’s training center after the squad returned from Portugal. Messi has been unusually quiet since the loss in Lisbon and hasn’t made any public statements, unlike after the team lost the Spanish league title to Real Madrid a few weeks ago and he came out to openly talk to the media. Earlier this season, Messi criticised Barcelona directors for some of their decisions. He was especially upset with sports director ric Abidal after he criticised players’ efforts amid a series of poor results. Barcelona said Tuesday that the club and Abidal had reached a mutual agreement to part ways. Messi had also said that he didn’t think Barcelona would succeed in the Champions League the way things were at the club. The club is also facing a difficult financial situation because of the coronavirus pandemic, which could make it harder to negotiate with Messi. Still, Bacelona president Josep Bartomeu has always said he expects Messi to finish his career at the club, and that Messi wants the same. The president reiterated that he was confident the playmaker would remain with the club, especially with former Dutch player Ronald Koeman set to become the team’s new coach. “Messi wants to finish his career with Barcelona, he has said it many times,” Bartomeu said. “I spoke with Koeman and he told me that Messi will be the central piece of his project.” The result of next year’s presidential elections will likely play a crucial role in Messi’s decision, and it will also be important whether he is happy with the work of the team’s new coach. The 33-year-old Messi is among the aging players within the squad, along with Gerard Piqu , Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic, Arturo Vidal and Jordi Alba. The youngsters touted as promising stars include Ansu Fati and Riqui Puig, though it’s too early to know how much they will be able to contribute to the first team in the future.

Zhao Wei, sanctioned as the leader of a “transnational criminal organization” by the U.S. Treasury, owns the Dok Ngiew Kham Group, and is co-owner of the Kings Romans International (HK) Co., Limited, which operates the Kings Romans Casino in Laos’ Golden Triangle SEZ. He is said to hold de facto control of the SEZ, which caters mainly to Chinese tourists. Zhao visited southern Laos’ Saravan province on March 27 to meet with Gov. Phoxay Xayasone to discuss the possibility of developing an airport and investing in several agricultural and tourism development projects, offcials said. The governor took him to see a large plot of land in Saravan’s Ta-Oey district, available for farming, raising livestock or building tourist attractions. Zhao saw pieces of land in Saravan’s Samoey district, which borders Vietnam to the east, where he likely plans to build a road. Officials from Saravan province confirmed Zhao’s visit in comments to RFA’s Lao Service March 31. “Mr. Zhao Wei met with the provincial governor then went to conduct a land survey in Samoy district… He’s looking to possibly invest in agricultural development,” said an official who requested anonymity to speak freely. Another official told RFA that Zhao came with land surveyors in tow. “They conducted a survey on a stretch of land near the Lao-Vietnamese border to plant commercial trees. They were just looking around, they don’t have a specific plan to do anything yet,” said the second official, who requested anonymity for professional reasons. A farmer in Ta-Oey district told RFA that Chinese agricultural development projects are worrisome, for pollution and commercial reasons. “The Chinese will use a lot of chemicals, and that’s harmful to the environment. The chemicals will also make their produce look better than ours and will bring down prices,” the farmer said. Zhao’s company is currently engaged in a feasibility study on a similar project in northern Laos’ Xieng Khouang province. The company looked at a piece of land in Pek district near the Plain of Jars, a major archaeological landscape and UNESCO World Heritage Site consisting of thousands of large prehistoric stone containers scattered about the area. “Zhao Wei visited here in August last year. He was looking for about 150 hectares of land for agricultural and tourist development that would include building hotels, raising cows and growing organic vegetables,” an official of the province’s Planning and Investment Department told RFA. “In May last year, Zhao Wei signed a MoU with the Lao government that allowed him to do a feasibility study on the 150-hectare land to develop a tourist attraction complex, a traditional medicine factory and a golf course. The central government gave permission to him to do the feasibility study because he has experience and money, but there’s no concession agreement yet,” said the official. The MoU states that the Dok Ngiew Kham Group will provide capital, technology and a market to local farmers to raise livestock and grow organic vegetables. The farmers will sell what they grow to Dok Ngiew Kham which will then export most of it to China. Local academics are concerned that the group has plans to turn the Plain of Jars into an attraction for tourists taking a break from the casino. “Chinese investments should be limited only to tourism because the Plain of Jars is one of Laos’ World Heritage Sites. It should be protected,” a Lao scholar told RFA. The jars are estimated to be 3,000 years old or older. “The project must not include a casino. Casinos bring a lot of problems like crime. They should only be allowed near border areas like in Bokeo and Savannakhet provinces,” said the scholar. Besides Saravan and Xieng Khouang, Zhao has explored a similar project in northeastern Laos’ Houaphanh province. In an August 2020 meeting with Houaphanh’s governor, Zhao said he wanted to build roads and tourist attractions in Houaphanh and invest in the area’s livestock industry. The Dok Ngiew Kham Group in 2017 cancelled a plan to build a U.S. $150 million international airport in the Golden Triangle SEZ. The group has reapplied for permission to pursue this plan, an RFA Lao Service source confirmed. RFA reported in October 2020 that the company had begun construction on a new port on the Mekong River to serve the SEZ. Zhao and then Deputy Prime Minister Bounthong Chitmany were present at the port’s groundbreaking ceremony on Oct. 3. In 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department declared the Zhao Wei network a “transnational criminal organization” (TCO) and imposed sanctions on Zhao and three other individuals and three companies across Laos, Thailand and Hong Kong. “Based in Laos within the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (GTSEZ), the Zhao Wei TCO exploits this region by engaging in drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, bribery, and wildlife trafficking, much of which is facilitated through the Kings Romans Casino located within the GTSEZ,” said a Treasury Department statement.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162000", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12848", "source": "scrapy"},

It spun a bit and rattled against the court. Surprisingly off-kilter in the early going Saturday, Osaka kept missing shots and digging herself a deficit. Until, suddenly, she lifted her game, and Azarenka couldn’t sustain her start. By the end, Osaka pulled away to a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory for her second US Open championship and third Grand Slam title overall. “For me, I just thought,” said Osaka, who trailed by a set and a break, “it would be very embarrassing to lose this in an under an hour.” This, then, is what she told herself with a white towel draped over her head at a changeover when things looked bleakest: “I just have to try as hard as I can and stop having a really bad attitude.” It worked. A quarter-century had passed since a woman who lost the first set of a US Open final wound up winning: In 1994, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario did it against Steffi Graf. “I wasn’t really thinking about winning. I was just thinking about competing,” Osaka said. “Somehow, I ended up with the trophy.” Osaka is a 22-year-old who was born in Japan to a Japanese mother and Haitian father; the family moved to the US when she was 3. Osaka, now based in California, arrived for the US Open intent on claiming the championship, to be sure, but with another goal in mind, as well: continuing to be a voice for change by calling attention to racial injustice. She showed up for Saturday’s match wearing a mask with the name of Tamir Rice, a Black 12-year-old boy killed by police in Ohio in 2014. That was the seventh mask she’d used during the tournament, after honoring other Black victims of violence: Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, Trayvon Martin, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and Philando Castile. “The point,” Osaka explained, “is to make people start talking.” Last month, Osaka refused to compete after the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in Wisconsin she said she would withdraw from her semifinal at the Western & Southern Open, although decided to play after the tournament took a full day off in solidarity. Osaka and her coach, Wim Fissette who used to work with Azarenka have said they think the off-court activism has helped her energy and mindset in matches. “I wanted,” Osaka said, “more people to (see) more names.” So perhaps it was no coincidence that this win over Azarenka, a 31-year-old from Belarus also seeking a third Grand Slam title but first in 7 years, made Osaka 11-0 since tennis resumed after its hiatus because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Osaka added to her triumphs at the 2018 US Open earned with a brilliant performance in a memorably chaotic and controversial final against Serena Williams and 2019 Australian Open. Azarenka carried an 11-match winning streak of her own into Saturday, including a stirring three-set victory over Williams in the semifinals, stopping the American’s bid for a 24th Grand Slam title. Azarenka won the 2012 and 2013 Australian Opens and lost to Williams in the US Open finals each of those years. “I thought the third time was the charm,” Azarenka said, “but I guess I’ll have to try again.” Even after Osaka surged ahead 4-1 in the third set, the outcome was unclear. Azarenka drew to 4-3, then stood and stretched during the ensuing changeover. “Had a little bit of a energy dip,” Azarenka said. Osaka regained control, then laid down on the court when the final was over. The 23,000-plus seats in the main arena at Flushing Meadows were not entirely unclaimed, just mostly so while fans were not allowed to attend because of the coronavirus pandemic, dozens of people who worked at the tournament attended and the cavernous place was not entirely silent, just mostly so. One of the lucky few in the house: Osaka’s boyfriend, rapper YBN Cordae. “I’m very grateful for the opportunity to play in front of millions of people watching on TV,” Azarenka said. “Unfortunately, they’re not here.” Certainly no thunderous applause or the cacophony of yells that normally would reverberate over and over and over again through the course of a Grand Slam final, accompanying the players’ introductions or preceding the first point or after the greatest of shots. Instead, a polite smattering of claps from several hands marked such moments. Azarenka led early thanks to terrific returning and let-no-ball-by defense, stretching points until Osaka missed. And she repeatedly missed; the first set was over in a blink. Azarenka broke early in the second set, too, to lead 2-0. The question shifted from “Who will win?” to “Might this be the most lopsided US Open final?” Except Osaka made subtle changes that altered the match. She stepped closer to the baseline, redirecting shots more immediately and forcefully. Azarenka began hitting the ball less stridently, making mistakes she avoided earlier.", "image_url": "<img width=\"1440\" height=\"810\" src=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816.jpg\" class=\"attachment- size- wp-post-image\" alt=\"naomi osaka\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816.jpg 1440w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.asian-times.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1440x810_cmsv2_bc0ae034-567d-564b-9556-50f5a48e4eda-4973816-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

It is dubbed as the Chinese version of the \"Mother of All Bombs\" due to its huge destructive potential that is claimed to be only second to nuclear weapons, the daily said. The bomb was airdropped by an H-6K bomber and caused a gigantic explosion, showed a promotional video released by China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) on its website at the end of December.  This is the first time the new bomb's destructive powers have been shown in public, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.  In April 2017, while waging war against militants in Afghanistan, the US military had dropped a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) weapon, more commonly known as the \"Mother of All Bombs,\" on the Islamic State. Although China is using the same nickname for its bomb, said to weigh several tonnes, the Chinese weapon is smaller and lighter than its American counterpart.  Judging from the video and the size of the H-6K's bomb bay, the bomb is approximately five to six meters long, Beijing-based military analyst Wei Dongxu told the Global Times on Thursday. \"The massive blast can easily and completely wipe out fortified ground targets such as reinforced buildings, bastions and defence shelters,\" Wei said. It can also be used to clear a landing zone for troops on helicopters to rappel down, in case the area is covered by obstacles such as forests, Wei noted. Wei said that the Chinese bomb is smaller and lighter than the US, enabling it to be deployed on the H-6K bomber. \"The US bomb is so large that it has to be carried by a larger transport aircraft rather than a bomber,\" Wei said, noting that a bomber can fly faster and is better at targeting than a transport aircraft, and the Chinese bomb's designer must have had this in mind when it produced the bomb to fit the H-6K. To match the US weapon, Russia developed the \"Father of All Bombs\" which is both bigger and thermobaric, meaning it uses gas to create a huge fireball rather than a shockwave, Wired reported. A NORINCO representative clarified that the bomb shown in the video is not a thermobaric weapon, but did not provide additional details, the Global Times report said.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"//cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2018/09/12/21192-thumbnail_gbu-43%25252520two-20170413061820.jpg?itok=4-4eSpO7\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162000", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21424", "source": "scrapy"},

Taiwan's military responded by scrambling planes to monitor the Chinese aircraft, issuing radio warnings and mobilizing air defense systems until the aircraft left the area, its ministry of defense said. Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu warned on Wednesday that the country would fight \"to the very last day,\" if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has never controlled Taiwan, were to invade. \"From my limited understanding of American decision makers watching developments in this region, they clearly see the danger of the possibility of China launching an attack against Taiwan,\" he told reporters. \"We are willing to defend ourselves without any questions and we will fight the war if we need to fight the war. And if we need to defend ourselves to the very last day we will defend ourselves to the very last day,\" Wu said. Meanwhile, the USS John S. McCain (DDG 56), an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, conducted \"a routine Taiwan Strait transit April 7 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law,\" the U.S. 7th Fleet said in a statement. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the move wasn't in response to \"specific events or actions,\" but rather to demonstrate its commitment to the freedom of all nations to \"sail, operate and fly in accordance with international law.\" China hit out at the United States for \"endangering the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.\" CCP leader Xi Jinping has told the country's military and armed police force to get 'combat ready' to defend national sovereignty and security, amid fears that Beijing may be planning an invasion of democratic Taiwan in the next few years. Gaining control over Taiwan has been highlighted as a core goal of Xi's \"national rejuvenation program\" by 2035, with some analysts saying Beijing will likely make its first move in the next few years. The top U.S. military commander in the region has warned that China could be preparing to bring forward plans to invade Taiwan as early as 2027. Admiral Philip Davidson, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Beijing could launch an invasion within the next six years. The PLA has flown multiple aircraft into Taiwan's ADIZ since the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden took office on Jan. 20. The ADIZ was created by the United States Armed Forces after World War II, and covers most of the Taiwan Strait, part of the East China Sea, and adjacent airspace. Not mentioned in or regulated by any international agreement, the zones extend far beyond territorial airspace and are designed to give a country more time to respond to potentially hostile aircraft. Taiwan's defense ministry said recent incursions have included bombers and fast-moving fighter jets usually used for offensive purposes. In 2018, the Pentagon warned that the PLA is gradually preparing for a possible invasion of Taiwan, as the CCP \"continued to develop and deploy increasingly advanced military capabilities intended to coerce Taiwan, signal Chinese resolve, and gradually improve capabilities for an invasion.\" Taiwan has never been ruled by Beijing nor formed part of the People's Republic of China, but has been locked out of international diplomacy and agencies at the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s insistence. Washington has said it will no longer seek to \"appease\" China on Taiwan, as the State Department announced an end to a ban on high-level official and diplomatic contact with Taiwanese officials on Jan. 9, at the tail end of the Trump administration. Under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, China has stepped up its rhetoric claiming the island as part of its territory, and has refused to rule out a military invasion. But Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly said that the country's 23 million people have no wish to give up their sovereignty or their democratic way of life.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162003", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12856", "source": "scrapy"},

The device monitors the health of the patient such as wandering, pulse, and BP. If the patient starts wandering, or if the patient has abnormal health conditions, an alert is sent to the caregiver and the doctor. The Prime Minister took to a prominent micro-blogging website to say. “I truly admire Hemesh Chadalavada’s sensitivity. Seeing his grandmother suffer from Alzheimer's, he decided to work on a 'Smart Wristband' that would help monitor aspects that relate to this disease. Congratulations on being conferred the Rashtriya Bal Puraskar 2021!”   Inventing was something that he took a fancy to. “I took part in Ideate for India in January last year. I was awarded by Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. Then, in February, I took part in a competition named 'Eureka Junior' in IIT Bombay,” he said. Prior to this invention, he had come up with a device that could make car rides safer. \"I had taken up a small project in which I came up with a device that could be attached to the seat belt buckle of a car.

For weeks, the Philippine government has engaged in a verbal tussle with Beijing and lodged diplomatic protests over the presence of dozens of Chinese ships in contested waters of the sea, but China has denied the allegations and said these are fishing vessels. “The U.S. admonition to China against the use of force on Philippine public vessels and aircraft, which are performing their constitutional mandate to protect and defend Philippine rights in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea, is an additional affirmation of the long-standing partnership between our two countries,” said Arsenio Andolong, a spokesman for the Philippine Department of National Defense.  “As the situation in the West Philippine Sea evolves, we keep all our options open in managing the situation, including leveraging our partnerships with other nations such as the United States,” Andolong said, referring to the section of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines.  A day earlier, the U.S. State Department reiterated that Washington was backing its longtime Asian ally – a former American colony – in the ongoing dispute over the Chinese ships moored at Whitsun Reef, which lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and other disputed waters in the Spratly Islands. “As we have stated before, an armed attack against the Philippines armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, will trigger our obligations under the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty,” Ned Price, the department’s spokesman, told a daily press briefing in response to a reporter’s question. Under the auspices of the 70-year-old treaty, the armed forces of the United States and the Philippines will come to each other’s military aid in the event of an external attack on one of them.  Despite repeated calls by Manila for the ships to leave the area and the filing of diplomatic protests, the Chinese vessels have lingered there.  Last week, the Philippine military said dozens of Chinese militia ships were scattered among contested reefs and islets in the Philippine EEZ.  China’s foreign ministry has insisted the area around Whitsun Reef belongs to Beijing. “The Philippines attempts to use an illegal, null-and-void award to negate China’s sovereignty, rights and interests, negate Chinese fishermen’s fishing history and rights in their traditional fishing grounds,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a press briefing on Tuesday. “We hope the Philippines will look at this objectively and correctly, immediately stop wanton hype … and avoid casting negative influence on bilateral relations and the overall peace and stability in the South China Sea,” he said. The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond on Thursday to the Philippine and U.S. statements. Beijing insists much of the South China Sea is its territory, despite a July 2016 international arbitral ruling by a United Nations-backed tribunal that affirmed the Philippines’ EEZ. Other governments claiming parts of the South China Sea are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Although Indonesia does not consider itself a claimant in the territorial disputes, China claims historic rights that overlap with Indonesia’s EEZ.  Since Monday the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs has filed daily protests against China about the ships in its EEZ. On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. again demanded that all the Chinese ships move out.  “Nobody fishes by lashing ships together. Last time that was done was the Persian invasion of Greece recorded by Herodotus,” Locsin said in a Twitter post late Wednesday. “We’ve seen that movie.” The Chinese presence in the Philippine EEZ also has Manila counting on its Visiting Forces Agreement with Washington, which President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to terminate. In February, Lloyd Austin, the defense chief in the new Biden Administration, reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to the 1999 VFA and the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty during his first official phone call with his Philippine counterpart, Delfin Lorenzana. The VFA, which allows the presence of U.S. troops in the Philippines, has remained in effect since Manila deferred its termination.  The pact is also the basis for another defense cooperation agreement, which allows U.S. troops to pre-position assets at certain Philippine military bases.  “We are continuously in talks with the U.S. on the matter of mutual defense,” Andolong said Thursday.  “Both parties are committed to undertake their obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty so that neither stands alone in these issues involving the two states’ inherent right of self-defense, individually and collectively,” he said.  The U.S., meanwhile, has maintained naval patrols in the South China Sea. On Sunday, the Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group entered the waterway to carry out maritime strike exercises, anti-submarine operations, coordinated tactical training, and other activities, according to the U.S. Navy.  On Wednesday, the Royal Malaysian Air Force announced it had completed a two-day bilateral military exercise in the sea with the Roosevelt strike group.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"210408-PH-CH-US-defense-inside.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/philippine/210408-ph-ch-us-defense-inside.jpg\" title=\"210408-PH-CH-US-defense-inside.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162006", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13170", "source": "scrapy"},

Our success will be decided by us not stepping outside homes when not needed. Our success will be decided by that those eligible for the vaccine get it.

There are no clear answers but top scientists say the complex interplay of mutant strains, a hugely susceptible population made more vulnerable by elections and other public events and the lowering of guard are primarily to blame. India's COVID tally has climbed to 1,33,58,805 (1.33 crore, 13.3 million) with a record spike of 1,52,879 daily cases, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday, in what many say is a second wave that is surging more powerfully than the first. As Delhi alone reported 10,732 fresh cases, far exceeding its earlier peak of 8,593 on 11 November, 2020, the number of active cases in the country breached the 11 lakh mark for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic. And just like there were no answers to why there was a slide earlier this year, there is no clarity on why the numbers are rising so sharply. While there are many imponderables and many things unknown, virologists Shahid Jameel and T Jacob John are agreed that not following   protocol, including informing people they must continue with precautions even after being vaccinated, and a sluggish vaccination drive are responsible. Jameel said the interplay of mutants and vaccines over the next couple of months will decide the future of Covid in India and the world. The intensity of the surge also suggests that there were ahuge number of susceptible people after the first wave, the director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University in Haryana told  . The Centre warned earlier this week that the next four weeks are critical and people's participation in helping control the second wave of the contagion is pivotal. NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said the pandemic situation has worsened with a sharp rise in cases and a large part of the population still susceptible to the virus, without giving any clear explanation on why this is happening. The fact that people lowered the guard and didn't follow Covid protocols after the first wave was over is certainly one valid explanation for the surge, Jameel said. Everything opening up to pre-Covid levels and behaviour that was no longer risk-averse exposed the susceptible population in a big way. A new factor is emerging mutants — both imported and homegrown, the eminent virologist added. John, professor of virology at Tamil Nadu's Christian Medical College (CMC), concurred with Jameel, saying not following   protocols is partly to blame for the new wave. Lowering of the guard was led by the central government and followed by all political parties, all religious groups, and the public at large. Schools and colleges were opened without vaccinating all staff. This explains partlythe second wave, John told  . Wherever infection was rising, stricter imposition of discipline should have been taken but with the elections ahead, no leader wanted that. Elections during pandemic had to be carefully planned, the renowned virologist told  . The scientist also agreed that variants are the other reason for the second wave, adding that it was too late for India to look for mutants. The two factors came together and we were leaderless in response at the critical time. The speed of spread in the second wave is twice as fast as in the first wave. Partly due to variants and partly lowering of the guard, John explained. Referring to a Health Ministry briefing on March 24, Jameel noted that the UK variants now show up in about 80 percent of cases from Punjab. A new double mutant has emerged in India and is reported in 15-20 percent of cases analysed from Maharashtra. If this percentage goes up further, it would be a clear indication of its role in the Maharashtra surge, said the virologist. In India, variants first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been found. In late March, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced that a new variant had been identified insamples of saliva taken from people in Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab. The genome sequencing carried out by Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a consortium of 10 labs in India, identified two important mutations in the variant dubbed as double mutant. Explaining that the UK variant is known to be about 50 percent more infectious, Jameel said one of the two mutations in the double mutant was also found in California, US, where it was associated with increased transmission. The two experts also discussed the country's vaccination drive. According to John, the government started the drive too lateand no outcome goal of vaccination was defined. India started slow vaccine rollout in January third week, but it was first a token reward to healthcare workers who were vaccinated even when there was no need -- and we wasted a lot of vaccines, he said. Was advance purchase order given to vaccine companies to get production accelerated during last year itself before approvals were obtained? John asked. Jameel said there was poor communication by officials to people who were vaccinated on how they must continue with precautions like masks and social distancing. Describing India's   situation as curious, Jameel said the country was on a falling curve of daily infections when vaccinations started in mid-January. For various reasons, those eligible, including healthcare and frontline workers, were hesitant to get vaccines. Those above 60 also did not show enough eagerness even though cases had started going up by early March. Now we are on a very fast rising curve with only 0.7 percent Indians having received both doses and only about 5 percent having received one dose. That is too low to make an impact, he added. He noted that there was no way to predict that younger people would be affected in this surge. Make everyone above 18 eligible for vaccination in states experiencing the surge, while staying with the 45 plus eligibility in states not experiencing the surge. Vaccinations have to be balanced against the supply of vaccines, Jameel said. Noting that supply may be an issue, Jameel said India has the capacity to inoculate with 10 million doses of Covishield vaccine per month and three million Covaxin doses per month. Supply can also be boosted by giving emergency use approval to Johnson & Johnson vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. Both of these have received approvals in other countries and have manufacturing partners in India, he added. According to the Health Ministry on Sunday, the death toll increased to 1,69,275 with 839 daily new fatalities, the highest since 18 October, 2020.The active caseload was at its lowest at 1,35,926 on 12 February. In a recent study, scientists, including those from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, predicted that the ongoing second-wave could peak by mid-April, following which the infections may see a steep decline by the end of May.", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"COVID-19 surge: 'Mutant strains, sluggish vaccine drive, carelessness' contributed to rise in cases in India, say scientists\" alt=\"COVID-19 surge: 'Mutant strains, sluggish vaccine drive, carelessness' contributed to rise in cases in India, say scientists\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/COVID640.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162006", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "41878", "source": "scrapy"},

Law, 27, tweeted earlier this week that he had been approved as a political asylum-seeker by the Home Office following a series of intervies over four months. The Hong Kong government said on Friday that it opposed the \"harboring of criminals\" by other countries, regions, organizations, or individuals. Apparently dispensing with Hong Kong's rule-of-law principle that the accused are presumed innocent until proven guilty, it said \"criminals [were alleging] that they were prosecuted for political reasons to deliberately escape justice.\" \"Any country, region, organisation or individual that harbours Hong Kong criminals in any form shows contempt for the rule of law, grossly disrespects Hong Kong's legal systems and barbarically interferes in the affairs of Hong Kong,\" it said, in comments closely resembling those made by a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing on Thursday.  \"They shall eventually bear the consequences of what they have done,\" it said. Beijing on Thursday accused the U.K. of \"harboring criminals\" after Law's asylum status was confirmed. \"The UK is clearly a platform for Hong Kong independence agitators, and provides so-called shelter for wanted criminals,\" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing in Beijing. \"The UK should immediately correct its mistake, and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs,\" Zhao said. Law said it was precisely the fact that he was wanted under the draconian national security law, that was imposed by the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Hong Kong from July 1, 2020, that led to his being considered at risk by the British government. \"The fact that I am wanted under the National Security Law shows that I am exposed to severe political persecution and am unlikely to return to Hong Kong without risk,\" Law wrote, citing the decision letter he received from the Home Office. He also called on the Home Office to consider accepting a broader range of evidence for Hong Kong applications. Amnesty International said the national security law had \"greatly restrict[ed] freedom of expression and other human rights in the city.\" \"The chilling effect of the NSL on Hong Kong civil society has been rapid and deeply disturbing,\" the report, issued by the Hong Kong branch of the London-based rights group, said. Two days after the law was passed, the Hong Kong government declared that the 2019 protest slogan 'Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!\" constituted an offense under clauses in the law banning pro-secessionist words and deeds, the report said. \"Individuals and businesses that had shown support for the 2019 protest movement deleted their social media posts and accounts for fear of retaliation from the authorities,\" it said. The law granted sweeping new investigatory powers to police, including the power to impose travel bans, to search people's homes, to freeze or seize their assets, and to place them under surveillance without a court order, the report said. Authorities in Hong Kong ruled on Friday that Tam Tak-chi, the detained vice chairman of the opposition party People Power, could be tried for sedition in the District Court, with no jury, despite arguments from his defense team that the court would have no jurisdiction in national security cases. Tam was arrested in September 2020 for using the protest slogans \"Free Hong Kong, Revolution Now!\" and \"Five demands, not one less!\" while giving speeches on the streets of Kowloon between March and July.  Tam is also accused of shouting: \"Dirty cops, hope your family members all die!\" and of making complaints relating to police inaction during a July 21, 2019 mob attack on train passengers in Yuen Long, and to riot police attacks on passengers in Prince Edward MTR station on Aug. 31, 2019.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162006", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12529", "source": "scrapy"}
