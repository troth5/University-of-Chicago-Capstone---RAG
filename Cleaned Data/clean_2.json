   "text":"A young economist who’s changing the concept of Wealth creation! Sahen Karamchandani is one of the young Chartered Wealth Manager in India who’s suddenly taken wings and awaken the kings! What he meant was, all the resources in this world won’t make you successful if you don’t have a hunger for planning for your success, especially investing in the financial markets. Sahen was one of the few Economists who had sensed the Blood in the market way before it wounded. Sahen had predicted and cautioned about a crash in the markets through his social media handle with an unrealistic fall of 2600 points target which later turned out to be a reality. (Link:  ). Sahen had even predicted a strong rebound and vigorously pushed investors to invest… now we all know how we regret and crave for the march levels again. (Link:  ). Growing up, Sahen recalls business channels as screens displaying green and red arrows on which he used to bet on, with his father. He said, “As I grew up, I began learning more about the uses of the financial markets. From my father using financial markets to make his investments, to the companies using these funds for expansion and development. Learning these aspects of Financial markets familiarised me with the sheer amount of power and versatility these markets possessed”. He soon began to find traces of financial markets everywhere that he looked from MNC’s to employees, investment to speculation, DII to FII, saving to economic development; every economic variable relied on financial markets to operate. Claiming to be a turning point in his life, he said, “My friend once told me ‘Yeh Company ke share lele bahut kamayega’ (Buy this share, you will make a lot). At first, I got carried away, but I had my doubts about whether or not it would work. I spent the night researching online and learning more about the suggested company, and by the next morning I realized that this was a dooming opportunity with the business having no future prospects.” I decided to back out on my Investment. Though I was right in the long-run, but my friend did make money in that stock in the short-run… it was that day I understood that the market don’t believe in tit for tat…numbers don’t dictate the stock price…the market sentiment decides. Numbers just tell you which stock to buy, but when to buy is the place where market sentiment walks in. On being asked, What does it take to become a successful wealth manager? He said, “People will say investment strategies, plan, contacts, luck, etc but No…it all comes down to one word ‘Trust’, the trust that I have in my investment suggestion, and the trust that investors have in me. There will be times when things don’t go your way, that’s natural buts that when you have to be there with your investors and face it out… rather than shying away like most of the wealth managers do and losing their trust. NEVER BREAK ANYONE’S TRUST IN LIFE. It takes 30 years to build a reputation and ten minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.” Going forward on the Indian Growth story He said, “I never saw the Indian long-term growth story endangered. Despite, the initial contraction by almost 24% in the first quarter due to covid, we have recovered well to reach the minimal shrink of 7.5% in Quarter 2. Moving ahead, we continue to see huge potential in India in the long run and believe our growth story is intact. And it’s not just I who believe soo… it’s also accepted by others, who are ready to invest in India. We expect the country to witness a ‘V’ shaped recovery post the vaccine roll-out. Sahen Karamchandani, aka the triple ‘M’, not only has fulfilled his childhood dreams but is also helping others achieve theirs with compassion and a positive mental attitude, becoming one of the best wealth consultants in India.  To learn more about this inspirational personality, follow his work on social media, and become a part of his large community.

   "text":"Mass incarceration of Uyghurs in northwestern China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) has scattered some 500,000 Uyghur children in boarding schools, orphanages, and other institutions run by the Chinese state—a state that experts say is committed to the long-term eradication of the ethnic group. The forcible transfer of children from one group to another that has been documented for five years in the XUAR is one of five acts that meet the threshold for genocide, argued international experts in a report issued this month by the Washington-based Newlines Institute. The Newlines report cited Article II of the United Nations’ 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which spells out five acts that constitute genocide, any one of which the group found to be sufficient for if intent to harm or destroy a group in whole or part is clear. Those findings came amid reports of Uyghur children in China being completely separated from their parents, orphaned, and deprived of the opportunity to reunite with their families. Family separation appears to be creating conditions of trauma, the long-term effects of which are difficult to predict. Investigative reporting over the past few years has shown that hundreds of thousands of Uyghur children live in some form of state care. These numbers, which were initially reported in 2018 and have likely grown since, are drawn from Chinese government reports and other documents. In some of the more shocking cases, Uyghur parents abroad have spotted their own children—some of whom they left behind when they emigrated, expecting to reunite with them not long after—in videos showing them receiving state education in XUAR boarding schools circulating on social media. Recently a video of a Uyghur child in Aksu (in Chinese, Akesu) prefecture circulated widely on social media both within and outside of China, raising alarm within the Uyghur diaspora. The video appears to show a six-year-old girl named Sabira speaking in Mandarin to her ethnic Han teacher. The girl hesitates to tell her teacher her brother’s name, noting that she only knows how to say her brother’s name in Uyghur, and she is worried she will be hit if she does not say it in Chinese. Former internment camp instructor Qelbinur Sidik, who fled to the Netherlands after working for a total of nine months in two different camps, was an elementary school instructor for 28 years. She recently spoke with RFA’s Uyghur Service about the video and about the broader environment of fear in the XUAR, noting that in recent years she taught many students who were afraid and hesitant, as well as who had become orphaned as a result of state policy. “If you watch that video, you can see there’s a fear that has settled throughout the girl’s entire body,” she said, noting that physical abuse grew more widespread in schools in the region as the number of Han teachers increased. “She can’t speak her own language, but she also can’t say [what she wants to say] in Chinese, and she knows she’ll be hit. This is how these children are living now … Because they’re always hitting and verbally abusing the kids, [the kids] fear they will be punished, and they can’t think about anything else.” According to Sidik, the number of orphaned students began to grow in 2016, ahead of the implementation of a campaign of mass incarceration in the XUAR that has seen up to 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities detained in a vast network of internment camps since early 2017. By 2018, she said, many classrooms were half empty. “The students started coming to us, saying [the authorities] had taken away their older siblings, mothers, their fathers,” Sidik said. “In that period, the Bureau of Education put out a notice saying that schools had to assign children who had been left alone after their parents were detained to different teachers who would be responsible for them,” she said. “I was assigned to two children from one family. I had to check on them. One of the children was a 12-year-old girl. I went to her house, arranged food for them, did work for them. I told them, ‘Your parents will come back, surely they’ll be back tomorrow or the next day.’ By November [2017], there were many such children, so they started assigning them to Han teachers.” Sidik said children in classrooms became meek and afraid, and if teachers had to speak to them more forcefully, they would react by raising their hands over their heads, as if to protect themselves from a potential blow. “Eventually, a lot of children disappeared. About half of them were gone. There was no trace of them after they disappeared,” she said. “They said they had placed them in boarding schools, that the government was sending them there and would be taking care of them.” Sidik said she often thinks of her students, who have been placed in what she called essentially “camps for children.” “They must think I’m a liar—I told them their parents would come back soon, but it’s been years and their parents still aren’t back. I think about this and cry,” she said. Uyghur children outside the XUAR are facing similar psychological anguish and other difficulties, as well. Sadirdin, a Uyghur living in Almaty, Kazakhstan, recently spoke with RFA about the effect that his wife’s internment has had on his children. Sadirdin’s wife, Muyassar, disappeared in 2016 after returning to renew her passport in Atush (Atushi), a county-level city of around 270,000 people that is the capital of Kizilsu Kirghiz (Kezileisu Keerkezi) Autonomous Prefecture in the cotton- and grape-growing region of southwestern XUAR. Muyassar had assumed her trip would take no longer than a month. She was released from a camp around one year ago but has still been unable to reunite with her husband and children across the border in Kazakhstan, which has led to much anguish for the family. “My daughter drew a picture about two months ago. Her teacher didn’t know that our family has been separated for the past five years. The teacher said to me, ‘Your daughter is sad.’ I asked if something had happened at school, and she told me about the drawing,” Sadirdin said. “I asked [my daughter] about the meaning and she said it was because we hadn’t seen her mother [for a long time]. She drew her mom sitting behind the house and it was raining. She was just in preschool when her mom left ... How can children deal with this?” Omer Bekri, an ethnic Uyghur who was the first former camp detainee to testify to the international media about the torture he faced while in state custody, was separated from his wife and children for eight months after he was detained on a trip back to the XUAR, where he was born, from Kazakhstan, where he had obtained citizenship. After nearly four years, Bekri was finally reunited with his family on Feb. 24. He spoke with RFA at length about the impacts of separation and fear on his three children, who were previously healthy and well-adjusted. “These kids can’t even express what it is they’re thinking now … One of their teachers in Turkey said the children would freeze up and couldn’t speak, that they couldn’t even say out loud what they wanted to say,” he said. “I can sense that what they need is love. This is a type of spiritual hunger … I’m the one who left them because I went into the camp. I wasn’t able to give them my love. They were abandoned, they lived life without their father, wondering if they’d ever see me again.” Bekri said his family life “has started over again from zero” and that his children are still dealing with the trauma of his detention. “These things stay with adults, so they certainly stay with children as well,” he said. “I’m giving all my time to my children right now, talking to them, playing with them, taking them out, letting them know their father is always available to play with them. This is a way to raise them, to show them what life is like, to show them how to live, what hope is.” Cathy Malchiodi, the director of Trauma-Informed Practices and Expressive Arts Therapy Institute and a U.S.-based expert with more than 35 years of experience in the field of child psychology, who spoke about the video of the young girl from Aksu, as well as on the drawing of a family split in two made by Sadirdin’s daughter, noting that they both contain expressions of fear. “Even in the situations before when there has been genocide, there’s never been this systematic reeducation to change people’s identities and to try to make them forget the past,” Malchiodi said. “These children may never be able to find out what really happened. There's going to be a lot of pain, depression, and anxiety. It will not go away, or you feel like there's something missing. And you're grieving something, but you don't know what it is you're grieving throughout your life,” she said. “Even though that happened several generations ago, we know that down to other generations, those generations are also carrying the trauma.” When asked how it will be possible for parents to help lessen the residual trauma and fear these children are facing, Malchiodi stressed the importance of breaking silence and allowing children to relate their experiences as a way of healing. “That's the whole thing in trauma, that people have these stories, and children, and we have to find ways for them to be able to tell the stories,” she said.",

The show, backed by Ding Entertainment, is scheduled to start streaming on ALTBalaji and ZEE5 Premium from 25 April. It stars Satyadeep Mishra, Priyamani Raj and Mrinal Dutt. Saria, who bagged the National Award for best direction last month for his feature  , took to Twitter on Friday and shared the poster of his acclaimed 2015 same-sex romantic drama, which featured the film's two leads lying in an embrace. The film starred Dhruv Ganesh and Shiv Panditt. The poster of   shared by ALTBalaji on its social media pages, also showed their characters in a strikingly similar position. In a Twitter thread, Saria wrote he was disappointed at the makers for \"blatantly\" copying his poster. \"Why is this industry like this? Woke up to find that our painstakingly illustrated, original poster for @loevfilm has just been blatantly ripped off by the geniuses at @altbalaji @ZEE5Premium for their show #HisStoryy. \"Thirteen months of back and forth and so many drafts by the amazing minds at @TalkPigeonCo with oversight by @jahanbakshi and amazingly illustrated by artist @rohanpore just ripped off without any decency,\" the director said.

   "text":": All those who have been displaced from 192 villages because of Polavaram Project are living in fear amid insecurity. They are all worried that the villages would be submerged in June or July because of cyclones and floods. They appealed to the Union and state governments to provide a relief and resettlement package to them, before the completion of Polavaram Project. According to them, nearly 3.5 lakh people, from Schedule Tribe and Scheduled Caste, are facing a threat of their livelihood. According to sources, the government completed 70 per cent of Polavaram project works by the end of December but only four percent of the R & R package was implemented. The Chief Minister aimed at completing the project by the year-end.   As per the 2017 statistics, 5,08,874 persons have been displaced and the number may increase. The state government had announced that 371 villages will be submerged due to the project and CCLA has given permission for providing R&R package to 164 villages. However, only 15 villages have been given partial R&R packages. \r\nIndian Association of Lawyers state executive member Inapurapu Suryanaryana said that the Comptroller and Audit General (CAG) found fault with the project as there is no MoU between Centre and the state government on construction of Polavaram project and advised the state government to reach a truce with the Union Government for the sake of the project.   To avoid submergence problems, the Centre advised state governments of Odisha and Chhattisgarh to construct protection walls at eight and four places, respectively. But, either has obliged. He said that the Union Government has also not taken any steps to have cases filed in the Supreme Court to be withdrawn by Odisha and Chhattisgarh. SC, ST vigilance and monitoring committee district member Ayithabathula Rameswara Rao demanded the government to halt Polavaram project works till the completion of R&R package works to 371 villages. He said that the ST Commission recommendations have not been implemented by the governments so far.   Adivasi maha sabha district secretary Karam Venkateswara Rao said that tribal people should be given fertile lands as compensation. The government should provide livelihood to people who will lose their forest products. He demanded the government should make a fresh integrated survey on the number of displaced persons and families under the project under New Land Acquisition Amendment Act, as the socio economic survey was last done in 2005 and there were no environmental clearance for the project till 2009.",

   "text":"Rising cases of Coronavirus have led to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy cancelling his public meeting in the temple town on April 14 as part of his campaigning in the Tirupati Lok Sabha byelection. Instead, he has decided to write a letter to voters of the constituency seeking their continued support for ruling YSR Congress’ development and welfare activities during the past 22 months.   In the letter, Jagan Mohan Reddy pointed out that Coronavirus cases in AP have been increasing rapidly, with the state reporting 2,765 new infections in last 24 hours, with positivity rate of 8.67 percent, which is higher than the national average of 5.87 percent. The cases have been rising also in Tirupati Parliament constituency, which is spread across Chittoor and Nellore districts. Of the 2,765 positive cases, 496 have been registered in Chittoor and 292 cases in Nellore district. Of 11 people who have died, four are from Chittoor and Nellore districts, he pointed out in the letter.   \"As the public meeting will attract huge crowds, I have cancelled it as a responsible Chief Minister and leader keeping in view the health and well being of people,” he maintained, appealing to voters to elect ruling party candidate Gurumurthy with an increased margin. The CM pointed out that he had earlier written letters to each and every family in the constituency. “Even if I personally do not campaign, I know that for your children, our sisters, our villages and towns, our SC, ST, BC and minority brother and sisters, and our elders, you will support our government. Hope you will shower more blessings than you did last time around and make our candidate, Dr. Gurumurthy, win with more majority than the last time (2.28 lakh).”  ",

   "text":"United States of America's naval operation near Lakshadweep has thrown up many questions and in the backdrop of Indo-US co-operation in the Quad alliance the recent development assumes interesting significance. US naval manoeuvre near the Lakshadweep came out of the blue. There was no indication, no diplomatic outreach. What does this mean for the democratic axis? More importantly, is it a setback in the battle against China? \r\n  India and the US are strategic allies. It is a partnership built on shared ideals like democracy, freedom of speech and rule of law. But today, there is a new common ground of security in the Indo-Pacific. Washington is betting on India to counter Beijing. This is reflected in America's policy realignment. It started with Trump. And has gained momentum under Joe Biden. It is vital that both sides see the bigger picture. This has been the case throughout history. Alliances survive as long as there is clarity on who the adversary is. For example, NATO has struggled to define itself.  The Quad must be wary of this. This so-called freedom of passage exercise was in simple terms, unnecessary. It wasn't a message to India, but to China. Washington wants to stamp its version of free navigation around the world. Allies, adversaries, it doesn't matter. This move reiterates America's resolve. But at what cost? The South China Sea is a disputed region. There are dozens of claims and counter-claims. There is an active aggressor in the form of China. On the other hand, India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is not a disputed region. There are no ambiguous claims of sovereignty, and there is no aggressor here. So America's adventurism here seems unwarranted. As allies, dialogue must be given priority. Differences have to be settled by diplomats, not warships. Small incidents can escalate fast. A break between India and the US would hand China the advantage. Washington needs to be wary of this. When Donald Trump was US President, he was accused of abandoning allies. He wanted to pull out troops from Germany. He asked South Korea to pay up for US deployments. Biden had some sharp words back then. Now that he's president Biden is promising change. He has told his partners that America is back. But actions like this make you doubt his sincerity. The president was lauded for his push to convene a Quad summit. It was the first time, leaders from the 4 countries met. However, as far as alliances go Quad is still a newbie. It must be cultivated into an iron bond. And India has been more than willing to engage. New Delhi has repeatedly committed itself to a free and open Indo-Pacific. And more importantly to freedom of navigation. The joint statement issued last month after the Quad virtual summit was signed by all four partners including India. \"We support the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, democratic values, and territorial integrity,\" said the statement. This is the spirit of Quad as agreed by all leaders. It also featured in the phone call between PM Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden. Allies inform, they consult and they act together. Without a joint spirit, alliances will exist only in name. America has taken a risk by wading into India's EEZ. Diplomats will most likely iron out the differences, but what about public opinion? On social media, Indians are not impressed by America's action. Domestic support is key to foreign alliances. They help leaders make long term commitments without stirring emotions back home. A 2014 pew survey found that 56% Indians held a favourable view of America. Washington cannot let that number drop any further. With this move, the US has also put other allies on notice. Japan, Australia, South Korea will all be watching closely. What is stopping US Ships from repeating this elsewhere? The American intention was to send a deadpan message. Ally or not, our worldview will prevail. But that's simply not how partnerships work.",

   "text":"India reported a record 145,384 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday and the highest number of deaths in more than five months, as it grapples with an overwhelming second-wave of infections that has forced the state of Maharashtra to impose a weekend lockdown.  Deaths rose by 794 to a total of 168,436, health ministry data showed.  India’s overall case load has swelled to 13.21 million, the third-highest globally, behind the United States and Brazil. India has reported the most number of cases in the world in the past week, breaching the 100,000 mark for the first time on Monday and four times after that.  The government blames the resurgence mainly on crowding and a reluctance to wear masks as businesses have nearly fully reopened since February, only to be partially shut again to control the current surge.  Maharashtra, the Indian state with the most cases, has already shut down restaurants, malls and places of worship and barred the movement of most people to control the outbreak that has threatened to overrun medical facilities and created vaccine shortages, officials said. Its weekend lockdown will end on early Monday.  In India’s financial capital Mumbai, hundreds of poor migrant workers crammed onto trains this week to flee the city, potentially risking a wider outbreak in smaller towns and villages.  The railways department denied people were fleeing cities because of the surge, calling it a usual rush this time of year because of holidays and as workers move to harvest crops.  Many states, meanwhile, have complained of a shortage of vaccines.  (With inputs from agencies) ",

   "article_summary":"“Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, because we were literally zooming into people’s homes,” said one recruitment expert.",
   "text":"For millions of Americans, the pandemic triggered an acute caregiving crisis, with working parents leaving their jobs as weeks of remote schooling turned into an entire year. But it has also forced a reckoning in corporate America about the day-to-day demands on working caregivers in general — and working mothers in particular. “Child care and balancing the demands of, say, dealing with a sick kid, have been perennial issues, even pre-Covid,” said Andrew Challenger, vice president at executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The pandemic, Challenger said, essentially pulled back the curtain to expose a rickety, fragmented system that didn’t function very well even at the best of times. When school resumed last fall, 865,000 women dropped out of the workforce between August and September alone, and women’s labor force participation has continued to plummet: As of last month, the labor force participation rate for men older than 19 was 69.5 percent. For the corresponding cohort of women, it was 57.4 percent. What happens next — and how much of the lessons of the pandemic will be retained in the future — could turn out to be an unexpected silver lining during a year of unprecedented stress and challenges. “Sometimes it takes a big crisis to set in motion shifts in compensation,” Challenger said. “This has always been part of the conversation — how do you give flexibility for the worker but still have consistency for the employer? This is something that has been exacerbated during the pandemic,” said Aliya Robinson, senior vice president of retirement and compensation policy for the ERISA Industry Committee, an association focused on benefits at large companies. “With this whole shift to work-from-home, I think a lot of employers realized there's a lot more ability than they anticipated to have employees working from home,” she said. This, in turn, has paved the way for greater acceptance of remote work, scheduling flexibility and more willingness to expand benefits specifically for caregivers — particularly as employers face the prospect of losing valuable talent. “I think it does indicate that this issue, particularly for women around caregiving and careers, has at least been recognized by a large number of organizations. In this crisis, we saw such an outflow of women from the workforce as the coronavirus hit,” Challenger said. “I think you’re starting to see smart companies recognize that if they want to be the best possible company they can be, which means having a diverse set of individuals leading their organization, that it's going to take an active effort to get women back into the pipeline and back into the office.” Research by the Society for Human Resource Management found that women are worried — often rightly so — that dropping out of the workforce can hurt their career advancement: A recent survey found that 27 percent of working women who also act as caregivers said the pandemic had hurt their professional development, compared to just 10 percent of men who said the same. According to surveys of 500 HR managers conducted by Care.com, human resources departments are reevaluating the kinds of benefits they offer employees — and making adjustments to address the yawning gap between caregiving demands and employers’ accommodation of those obligations. More than three in five survey respondents said they plan to increase childcare benefits, while about two in five will expand offerings for elder care. “Caregiving challenges are not new for families. They were just really highlighted during Covid, and that’s because we were literally 'Zooming' into people’s homes,” said Alyssa Johnson, senior director of account management at Care.com. “Employers have literally had a front-row seat into people's homes and lives, and they've seen the challenges families have faced,” she said. “It’s just an acknowledgement of this idea that emergencies happen, emergency child care situations arise. Companies that have now been forced to reckon with a mass child care emergency now have the tools and wherewithal to help employees,” Challenger said. Addressing this is less a matter of altruism than accounting. “Half of HR leaders are seeing productivity decrease in working parents,” Johnson said. “It’s never been clearer — employers are realizing that care challenges have had a significant impact on their workforce, and there is just a real connection between child care and employee performance.” In addition to diminished productivity, employee departures extract a tangible financial toll on employers. “They may actually lose a significant portion of their workforce. That can affect the bottom line,” said Amber Clayton, director of the Society for Human Resource Management Knowledge Center. The opportunity cost of having to devote resources to recruit, hire and train replacements when women leave the workforce can be steep: Pre-pandemic research from SHRM suggested that replacing a salaried employee can cost between six and nine months of that worker’s annual pay. “Hiring and re-hiring is really expensive. Companies are always looking to decrease turnover. There's a real recognition that this is an issue that needs to be addressed,” Challenger said. HR experts report that employers are experimenting with different tools and approaches to ease the burden of caregivers trying to juggle work and family obligations. In addition to greater acceptance of remote work and nontraditional work hours — including longer breaks so parents can supervise kids’ remote lessons — some have expanded paid or unpaid leave, provided subsidies for on-site or in-home child care, or offered on-site child care for employees who can’t work from home. “Employers have stepped up and are making those accommodations,” Clayton said. In a recent survey of more than 200 HR executives, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 84 percent said they are offering workers more flexibility, with many making changes specifically in response to workers’ caregiving obligations. Two out of five reported that they specifically have extended greater flexibility to parents, with 23 percent expanding paid time off and 13 percent offering child care options. Of those, the vast majority — 95 percent — said they plan to make some or all of these changes permanent. “I think it was very eye-opening for employers,” Clayton said. “It forced them to look at their policies and procedures overall.” This is a paradigm shift, experts say, that is long overdue. “It highlighted the need for employers to step in and play a role,” Johnson said. “When families are forced to choose between families and work, no one wins.”",

   "article_summary":"According to the CISF, the mob of around 150 first manhandled the polling staff at the booth",
   "text":" The fourth phase of Assembly elections in West Bengal witnessed unprecedented bloodbath on Saturday when the Central paramilitary forces gunned down four Trinamul Congress workers during an attack on a polling booth while ruling party workers allegedly shot dead a first-time voter outside a booth during a clash. Both incidents took place in Cooch Behar of North Bengal, the BJP’s stronghold. The Election Commission said that the CISF had to fire in order to save lives of voters who came to vote, put in place certain restrictions, including extending the \"silence period\" from 48 hours to 72 hours for the fifth phase of polling West Bengal. It also barred the entry of politicians in Cooch Behar district for the next 72 hours to prevent any possible law and order flare-up.   The shocking incident took place at around 10.30 am when a group of TMC workers stormed a polling booth (No. 126) at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra in Shitalkuchi Assembly constituency. Facing their attack, Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) troopers, who were guarding the booth, fired on the mob and shot dead four persons — Hamidul Haque, Monirul Haque, Samiul Mian and Amjad Hossain — while injuring three others.  According to the CISF, the mob of around 150 first manhandled the polling staff at the booth. Sources said they were not “armed”, but some were carrying bamboo sticks. \"The CISF booth commander tried to pacify the miscreants but the mob entered the polling booth and beat up the other polling staff on duty. Few miscreants tried to snatch the weapons of CISF personnel deployed there. As a result, CISF personnel fired two rounds in the air but the mob did not pay any heed to the warning. In the meantime, a quick response team of the CISF and police also reached the spot. The mob further started advancing aggressively towards CISF personnel. Therefore, sensing imminent danger to their life, they fired seven more rounds towards the advancing mob of miscreants. While the above incident was going on, more police parties also arrived at the booth. It is reported that in self-defence they have also fired a few rounds,\" the CISF said.   Polling was stopped immediately by the EC.  The CISF's justification of \"self-defence\" was supported by the district police and administration in its preliminary report to the EC which, issuing the CISF a clean chit later, said, \"Recourse to open fire by CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save lives of voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as mob had attempted to snatch their weapons.\" The TMC, however, described the shooting as “cold-blooded murder\" of its workers in its complaint to Chief Electoral Officer West Bengal Ariz Aftab. Spewing venom against the Central forces and Union home minister Amit Shah, an angry chief minister flew to Siliguri and announced that the Criminal Investigation Department would probe the killings.    The TMC chief is likely to visit the kin of the deceased on Sunday though the EC has banned the entry of any politician of any level in Shitalkuchi.  The tragic incident follows party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee's recent statements that the Central forces were acting in a biased manner at the behest of the BJP and asking voters to gherao them. On Saturday, her party landed in the dock after its workers shot dead a first-time voter, Ananda Burman (18), in the same district. The teenaged boy was standing in a queue outside a polling booth (No. 285) at Pathantuli Shalbari area when a scuffle broke out between TMC and BJP workers. Another person, close to him, also suffered bullet injuries.   Despite the poll-violence, the 44 seats spread across five districts of West Bengal recorded a voters' turnout of 76.16 per cent on average till 5 pm. While Cooch Behar saw 79.73 per cent polling in nine seats, the figure stood at 73.65 per cent in five of Alipurduar seats, 75.49 per cent in 11 seats of South 24 Parganas, 75.03 per cent in nine seats in Howrah and 76.02 per cent in 10 Hooghly seats.  Updated data is expected from the Election Commission on Sunday. Among the 11 seats in South 24 Parganas, five -- Jadavpur, Kasba, Tollygunge, Behala East and Behala West -- are actually located in Kolkata.  The Election Commission’s order said that in Cooch Behar, comprising nine Assembly constituencies where voting got over on Saturday, no political leader from any national, state or other party should be allowed to enter the geographical boundaries of the district for the next 72 hours.   \"The Election Commission of India further directs that the silence period for phase 5 (i.e. for polls scheduled on April 17) shall be extended to 72 hours and no campaigning shall be permitted during 72 hours before the close of the poll in order to ensure the conduct of free, fair and peaceful elections,\" an EC order said. The silence period is generally for 48 hours.",

   "article_summary":"Centre playing politics by giving more vaccines to BJP-ruled states and fewer to non-BJP governed states, says Maharashtra health minister",
   "text":"On a day India recorded about 1.32 lakh fresh cases of Covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conferred with the Chief Ministers of several states in virtual mode to discuss the surging Covid-19 infections and the vaccine strategy. He told the Chief Ministers to strengthen their efforts for the next 2-3 weeks to check the spread of the virus on a “war-footing” and to focus on vaccinations and testing and hold a special drive — ‘vaccine festival’— from April 11 to 14 to cover all eligible beneficiaries over 45. He also asked the states to prevent vaccine wastage.   He defended the eligibility criteria for vaccination amid demand by some states, ruled by Opposition parties, to open the vaccination for all above 18 years. India's criteria is no different from the most prosperous countries in the world, Modi said. States like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Haryana and Chhattisgarh have complained to the Centre regarding the shortage of oxygen, remdesivir and vaccine supply and said the vaccine drive will be severely impacted due to this.  Union health minister Harsh Vardhan dismissed these allegations, saying enough vaccines had been given to the states. Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister took the second dose of Covaxin at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, meanwhile, tested positive for Covid-19. He had taken the first dose of the vaccine on March 3.   Addressing the meeting, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said his state has vaccine supply only till Friday, while several vaccine centres in Maharashtra had to be closed for the want of vaccines. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday attacked the Centre for playing politics during the pandemic by giving more vaccines to BJP-ruled states and fewer to non-BJP governed states.  He accused the Centre of giving Maharashtra only 7.5 lakh doses against its demand for 40 lakh vaccines. The minister said the state was aiming to vaccinate five to six lakh people daily to break the chain of transmission.  Tope also held meetings with the manufacturers of Covid-19 drug Remdesivir and asked them to double the production for the state. In order to increase beds for patients, the Pune administration has tied up with the Army Hospital to provide 40 ICU beds.   Health minister Harsh Vardhan said: “The hue and cry by certain states about partisanship by the Union government is just a farce, an attempt to hide their own incompetence. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are two of the top three states based on the allocation of Covid-19 vaccine doses. Both are non-BJP governed states. Let’s put an end to the fear-mongering now! Covid-19 vaccine doses: Total administered: 9 crore plus, in stock/nearing delivery to states: 4.3 crore plus. Where does the question of shortages arise? We’re continuously monitoring and enhancing supply.”  According to him, Maharashtra was given 1.06 crore vaccine doses, Gujarat 1.05 crore and Rajasthan 1.04 crore, while the country’s average distribution was 37.11 lakh.  ",

   "text":"As India continues to witness a sharp rise in the number of   cases, various state governments have issued travel restrictions and guidelines to curb the spread of the disease. The latest addition to this is  . The state government on Sunday (April 11) made it mandatory for people coming from seven high load states to produce a RT-PCR negative report obtained within 72 hours of entry, from April 16 onwards. These high load states are Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. This was part of the state government’s fresh guidelines issued by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur following a spike in Covid-19 cases across the state. The government has allowed tourists to visit the state as of now, but has also directed hotel owners and tourists to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures (SoPs) issued by the government, Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said. Calling it a matter of concern, the CM said that during the last 45 days, the state has reported 10,690 new COVID-19 cases, while with 120 fatalities the number of deaths have also increased rapidly. Under the new guidelines, devotees in the state have been allowed to visit temples during the Navratri festival but they will have to perform ‘puja’ and ‘darshan’ by maintaining social distancing and using face masks.  However, organising ‘langars’ or community kitchens and ‘jagran’ have been banned by the government. No overcrowding would be allowed in buses and public transport vehicles, the CM said. Earlier this week, the state government had restricted gatherings in marriage ceremonies to 50 people indoor and maximum of 200 in open space while only 50 persons would be allowed to attend funerals. The state currently has 4,659 active cases of COVID-19, as per the Union Health Ministry. (With agency inputs)",

   "article_summary":"Kolkata Knight Riders defended the 187-run total as Andre Russell and Prasidh Krishna bowled well at the death to restrict Sunrisers Hyderabad.",
   "text":"Kolkata Knight Riders have opened their account with a win against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in their first game of the 2021 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).   side defended the 187-run target by 10 runs as it proved to be too much for Manish Pandey in the end after they lost a few wickets in quick succession. Pandey anchored the innings for the Sunrisers with a 44-ball 61* with a strike rate of 138, but the target needed for him to play a little bit quicker as it put too much pressure on the other batsmen to get going from the outset. Hard-hitting all-rounder Abdul Samad did hit a couple of lusty blows after coming in at No 7 was it was too late as the required run-rate had gone out of the reach for the SRH side. They didn't have a great start to their innings both the openers by the third over, however, a 92-run partnership between Jonny Bairstow and Pandey came to the rescue for the Sunrisers. Both brought up their fifties and after settling down took the attack to the KKR bowlers. However, Bairstow got restless after playing three dots in the 13th over bowled by Pat Cummins and he hit straight into the hands of the backward point fielder.  The wicket came at the right moment for the KKR but wrong for the SRH as they just started to amp up towards the 188-run target on a slowish pitch. Sunrisers then lost a couple of more wickets and the innings suddenly lost the momentum and it got to a sluggish end and they fell short of the target despite Pandey and Samad being there at the end. Earlier,   played a decisive cameo of 22 runs off just 9 balls to help KKR finish on a high after they lost four wickets in just 14 runs. Nitish Rana and Rahul Tripathi stitched a 93-run partnership to give KKR much-needed momentum as the duo ripped apart the Sunrisers' bowlers. Rana, who recovered from COVID-19 last week came out all guns blazing and nine fours and four sixes in his knock of 80 runs. While Tripathi was the aggressor hitting fifty off just 28 balls.",

   "text":"Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli says dropping the sitters has hurt his team, which endured a 59-run drubbing at the hands of Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League. All-rounder Marcus Stoinis was dropped on 30 by Yuzvendra Chahal, after which he went on to score a 26-ball 53 and power the Capitals to 196 for four at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Monday. Kohli himself had dropped KL Rahul twice in RCB’s loss to Kings XI Punjab earlier in the tournament. “Those important chances in between, we need to grab when the opportunity comes our way. It is not like we are dropping half chances, we are dropping sitters and those things hurt you,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony. “We got into the game after the first six and then Stoinis batted really well in the end, we gave him a life, he took the game away from us,” he added. Delhi were off to a flying start with openers Prithvi Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan adding 68 runs. The RCB bowlers were able to pull things back, picking up quick wickets before slipping again. “I think they got off to a great start in the first six then we pulled it back in the next eight overs and the last phase again got away from us,” Kohli said. RCB have won three of their five matches. However, both their losses have come while chasing big targets. “I think it is about rectifying those small mistakes. The conversation around chasing is always to have a big partnership, with the dew setting in had we kept 7-8 wickets at the end of 10 overs, the game would have been on,” Kohli said. Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer was delighted with his team’s all-round performance. “Our strategy was to be fearless and play with full freedom. We have got good youngsters in our side, so we just need to go out and execute our talent and skills. I am very happy with the way things are going so far, and we need to keep up the momentum,” Iyer said. “It is important for us to get a good recovery. It isn’t easy going back into the bio bubble, so we try to spend time with each other and that is working really well for us,” he added. Axer Patel (2/18), who came in to the side in place of the injured Amit Mishra, played a vital role in his side’s victory and was adjudged the Man of the Match. “I knew it was stopping on the wicket. I knew I would bowl in the Powerplay and I had practised for it as well. I executed my plans really well. “My plan after speaking to batsmen was that since the wicket was slow, I wanted to bowl at the stumps and vary the pace. “In the Powerplay I was in a mood to defend at first, but when the third ball spun I changed gears and got into an attack mode,” he said.

The police of Alibaug had filed a case two years ago for the incident but the case was later brought to an end by Raigad Police in 2019. The Maharashtra Police has not released the official statement in connection to the case. Clippings displayed in various news channels depicted that Arnab Goswami was taken by cops in a police van.

   "text":"A rare goal from full back Matteo Darmian earned Inter Milan a 1-0 victory over Cagliari on Sunday, as Antonio Conte's side closed on their first Serie A title in 11 years. Juventus however eased to a 3-1 victory over Genoa to keep alive their faint hopes of making it 10 successive Serie A titles this season. Third-placed Juventus moved on to 62 points after 30 matches, one behind AC Milan and 12 adrift of leaders Inter Milan. Struggling Cagliari were proving to be a tough nut to crack in the San Siro, with debutant goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario making several fine saves to keep the league leaders at bay. But the visitors' resistance was broken by an unlikely source in Darmian, whose second league goal of the season in the 77th minute secured Inter a 11th successive league win. \"I like to repeat - these matches are starting to feel like victories are worth six points,\" Conte told DAZN. \"Milan won (on Saturday) and it was important for us to keep our lead. It is not easy but we are getting used to it. \"For many it is the first time being under pressure like this, playing always to win. I am very satisfied with what we are doing.\"  ",

   "article_summary":"American player Glenn Cowan (right) shakes hands with Chinese player Zhuang Zedong(center) after getting off a bus for Chinese players during the 31st World Table Tennis Championships on April 4, 1971 in Nagoya, Japan. Glenn Cowan, who missed a bus for his own team, accidentally boarded a bus for Chinese players, which led to a domino of events that saw the normalization of the China-US relationship. Photo: Collected ",
   "text":"\"We were on the bus and were talking and laughing,\" Zhang, now 80, told AFP. \"But when we realised that an American had come onto the bus, we fell silent.\" The Chinese triple world champion Zhuang Zedong eventually came forward and famously broke the ice, giving Cowan a silk embroidery as a souvenir from China. They did not know it at the time, but it was the spark for China and the United States to begin normalising relations, in what became known as 'ping-pong diplomacy'. Zhang, a doubles world champion and later China's coach, recalled: \"Mr. Zhuang understood that there was a difference between the American people and the American government, and that we should be nice to American people, so he took the initiative to chat with Glenn.\" Photographers captured Zhuang and a 19-year-old Cowan shaking hands and smiling. \"The newspaper came out the next day and it seemed that China and the United States were about to have a relationship,\" said Zhang. Days later, on April 10, 1971 the US team became the first Americans to step foot in China for nearly a quarter of a century when they were invited to play friendly matches in the country. The thaw saw President Richard Nixon visit China in February 1972, and a Chinese table tennis squad visit the US. In 1979 formal relations were established between the two countries. Yao Zhenxu played Cowan, who died in 2004, during the Americans' ground-breaking trip. Yao still remembers the score, he won 21-12, 21-14, and says that Cowan thanked him afterwards for \"a serious game\". The American team were vastly inferior to the Chinese, so the hosts sometimes let their visitors win points in the spirit of sportsmanship and goodwill. Now 74, Yao says that it was only afterwards that he realised that he had played a part in something historic. \"Because of ping-pong diplomacy we changed the world order, and the people of China and the United States started friendly exchanges,\" he said. Yao appeared alongside Zhang in Shanghai on Saturday to mark 50 years of ping-pong diplomacy, with the city authorities hosting an event with speeches and friendly amateur matches. But the anniversary comes at a time when relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated markedly over a number of issues, notably trade, the fate of China's Uyghur minority and a clampdown in Hong Kong. In a recorded speech to mark the 50th anniversary, China's ambassador in Washington, Cui Tiankai, accused some in the US of \"ideological bias and zero-sum thinking\". But he and Chinese state media took a largely positive tone, with Xinhua news agency hailing ping-pong diplomacy's \"wonderful legacy\". Yao and Zhang hope that the spirit of 1971 can help shape future relations between the world's top two economies for the better. \"Everyone knows that the relationship between China and the United States is a bit tense nowadays,\" said Yao. \"We hope that we can agree to disagree and keep friendly relations. \"Don't be afraid of competition, we can compete peacefully.\"",

   "text":"Oberstein: Later this month, the Jewish people will celebrate Passover, which is the story, as many people know, of the [Jewish] exodus [from enslavement in Egypt]. It's a story of slavery to redemption, of people who were exiled and found their freedom. And so, for a number of reasons, not just because it resonates so deeply with the Jews, it's a universal story. It is a time when we talk about us being strangers in a strange land. We're going to have three days of action. The first day will be a global seder (Passover dinner) … A number of Jewish and Uyghur leaders coming together to raise our collective voices to call for an end to the atrocities that are happening to the Uyghurs. The next day will be a day of global advocacy … and the third day is a day of business engagement. As I'm sure you know, more than 90 multinational corporations are unfortunately utilizing Uyghur slave labor … Four of these corporations actually have ties to the Holocaust, and so, again, it’s something that's deeply personal for the Jewish community on this day of business engagement. We intend to reach out to some of those companies that have these ties and talk to them about not repeating the same mistakes that they made more than 75 years ago. You know, a conversation that I keep having recently is that we are in a moment right now that feels so similar to the moment right before the Berlin Olympics in 1936. The Beijing Olympics are approaching and people are saying broadly the things that they were saying right before the 1936 Olympics—“Look at the way that Germany is contributing to the world economy, the way that they’re cleaning up the streets,” or “they’re so innovative” … Germany was creating the systemic ways that they were “othering” and dehumanizing the Jewish people, but the ways that [the public was] willing to overlook putting all Jews into one neighborhood or interning them or setting up train stations, we hear the same things happening in [the XUAR] and we—the Jewish community, these human rights organizations, and the leaders of these other organizations—are coming together to raise our collective voices to say enough is enough, we have to pay attention. And making sure that never again isn't just an empty phrase, but a call to action. Oberstein: The IOC by now, again, should have learned its lesson. We can't just crack down on countries that don't play a role in the world economy … The purpose of the Olympics is to create an even playing field … Growing up, the message that I received about the Olympics was that it was about unity, unity and human rights and brotherhood and sisterhood. And by ignoring that there is an ethnic minority being … persecuted sends a message that that they’re willing to stand idly by. There’s a saying in Judaism that “silence is complicity” and Jewish World Watch holds that phrase and that idea very close that it’s not OK to witness something and then do nothing. Oberstein: Yes absolutely … We hear about people being taken in the night, disappeared, their heads shaved. We hear about the train stations and the systemic rape and people being interned and forced slave labor, we hear about China now disseminating companies around the country and shipping people to those to those companies. This is the infrastructure that was created in Germany leading up to the Holocaust. Maybe no one is being mass murdered to the same degree, but we don't know that yet. Right? Information that's coming out of the region may be years old, so we don't know exactly how far down the road China is. And what we do know indicates exactly what Germany was doing to prepare for the Holocaust. So, if that's not enough information, I don't know what the U.N. needs in order to act. But I know Jewish World Watch sees what's happening and sees the writing on the wall, like many of these other Jewish human rights organizations, and we know that “never again” is right now. Oberstein: We have legislation that's open right now in Congress, which is the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, so the first thing that we can do is pass that immediately. It's imperative that we take the first steps so that companies that are making money on the enslavement and persecution of the Uyghurs stop immediately. In 2020, we passed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, to protect Uyghurs living in this country from extradition and harassment. We need to hold true to that. We need to make sure that Uyghurs who have fled persecution are not persecuted. And I think we need to stand strong against the Chinese government and against the CCP. It's not enough to say that there are differences of culture … That's not a relationship that we need to hold on to. We need to stop it. We need to set boundaries. We need to sanction them and stop them from going any further.",

   "text":"At 77, Joe Biden is set to be the oldest president in US history. After a nail-biting election day that extended by nearly a week, Democrat Joe Biden finally won the mantle of the 46th president of the United States of America on Saturday, 7 November, after a victory in Pennsylvania. Soon after the victory, Biden took to Twitter to say, “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country”. The Biden Campaign also released a statement from the president-elect on Saturday, in which he said, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation.” Several US networks projected Biden as having won the presidential race after securing the key battleground of Pennsylvania, which helped him cross the 270 votes needed to win. With 20 electoral votes from the state, Biden now has a total of 273 electoral votes. He ran for president in 1988 but withdrew after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British leader Neil Kinnock. Biden ran for the presidency again in 2008 but later withdrew from the race. The candidates had been locked in a virtual dead heat for days, and  reported that Trump’s chances of winning a second term depended on his ability to hang on to his leads in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania. However, Biden narrowed the gap in both states as vote counting progressed, finally winning Pennsylvania with 49.7 percent of the vote, as opposed to Trump’s 49.2 percent. Once he had gained ground in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia on Thursday he got to closer to defeating President Trump. “Democracy is sometimes messy. It sometimes requires a little patience as well. But that patience has been rewarded now for more than 240 years with a system of governance that’s been the envy of the world,” Biden had said as he awaited the results.",

   "text":"Netherlands Ambassador Marten van den Berg has said that India is a ‘key player in the Indo-Pacific’, and sees New Delhi ‘as a key partner in addressing all the challenges in the Indo-Pacific region’. Speaking exclusively to our Principal Diplomatic Correspondent Sidhant Sibal, Marten van den Berg also lauded India's role amid the Covid pandemic. He said, \"Happy the way, India is presenting itself as a very important vaccine manufacturing country and taking big responsibility\" and it has a \"very positive impact on the world in addressing the covid pandemic crisis.\"  Netherlands Prime minister Mark Rutte and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a virtual meet on Friday. One of the key outcomes of the meet was that both countries announced a ‘strategic partnership on water’. The Netherlands is a world leader in water management and a collaboration with New Delhi aims to increase research and innovation in the sector.  Sidhant Sibal: Key outcomes of the virtual summit?  Marten van den Berg: Netherlands and India have a long-term relationship and both Prime Ministers know each other very well. So, it was a very open and productive meeting. The outcome was a strategic partnership on the water between Netherlands and India. We are active already in India on the topic of water, in terms of water management, dealing with floods and also water scarcity. We have a large programme in Chennai, we are doing a lot of research with India, and decided to bring it to a higher level, so as to have a strategic relationship on the water to address the challenges we both face in our countries over water.  Sidhant Sibal:  How do you see India-Netherlands engagement going forward?  Marten van den Berg: We will have more meetings at a political level. We have upgraded collaboration on the water. We are quite active in research and innovation so that we will strengthen our joint research programmes. We have collaboration with the department of science, department of biotechnology with India. strengthen collaboration on health, agriculture, water in terms of research, trade, investment. Also on the issue of space, the close relationship between the two countries. We see a lot of opportunities. Also on energy and climate. We are both partners in the international solar alliance. India is ambitious on renewables. A lot of opportunities on offshore wind, solar energy, a grid system. We decided to go next step to deal with the challenges of climate.  Sidhant Sibal: The Netherlands has been a world leader in climate technology. Your PM has been famous for cycling around, and gifted cycle to PM Modi. How both countries are engaging on climate issues?  Marten van den Berg: It is a very important part because the climate challenge is a real global crisis and maybe one of the biggest crisis we face at the moment, maybe after Covid. What we have to do is fast track sustainable development in Netherlands and India. We are partnering in developing clean technologies, working on decarbonisation, also important, in the context of the international solar alliance, both countries work together in Africa to fast track in sustainable development, introduce clean technologies, fast track in phasing fossil fuels.  Sidhant Sibal: What is Netherlands' view on Indo-Pacific?  Marten van den Berg: Indo-Pacific region is a very important region. If you look at economic figures, it is of increasing importance in the world. So, on one hand, you see a lot of economic opportunities, you see some challenges, some concerns, so we are very much in favour of an open inclusive rules-based society. Two PMs discussed this topic in how we can strengthen the institutions, how we can strengthen the rule of law, how we can strengthen institutions for enforcing the rule of law. we doing that in terms of discussion. We are getting more collaboration on maritime security, sharing expertise, maybe also training, exercise together. We see India as a key player in the Indo-Pacific, we see India as a key partner in addressing all the challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. The Netherlands proposed Indo-Pacific strategies, guidelines on how we can address the challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.    Sidhant Sibal: How are both countries planning to increase cooperation on dealing with pandemic, vaccines?  Marten van den Berg: Covid is a huge concern to all of us. We work closely together, both countries working on health issues. Also on vaccine development, research and science. Serum Institute has a plant in the Netherlands. So, there is a close collaboration with Serum Institute, and we are happy the way India is presenting itself as a very important vaccine manufacturing country, taking big responsibility and have a very positive impact on the world in addressing the Covid pandemic crisis. We are looking forward to strengthening our collaboration on vaccine development and vaccine manufacturing.  Sidhant Sibal: A personal question, if you can talk about the history of the place you are living in?  Marten van den Berg: The residence of the Netherlands envoy is the Jinnah house, and in this library, Gandhi, Jinnah and Nehru discussed independence and partition. So, historically, it is a very important place, a lot of important discussions took place and Nehru, Gandhi came here. It's a privilege to be ambassador to India and also living in this very historical place in India. ",

   "article_summary":"That said, there are some recent emergencies of the new variants in the localised lockdowns that are seen as one of the threats to this recovery, Brooks noted.",
   "text":"India, which is projected to grow at an impressive rate of 12.5 per cent this year, needs to grow at a much faster pace to make up for the unprecedented contraction of eight per cent that it clocked during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a senior IMF official. The International Monetary Fund Deputy Chief Economist, Petya Koeva Brooks, in an interview to PTI on Friday also made a strong case for an additional economic stimulus to address the impact of the pandemic on the country's economy. \"When it comes to India there was a major collapse of output last fiscal year and the number as you mentioned is eight. \"So, we are very glad to see the strong rebound this year with projected growth of 12.5 for fiscal year 21-22 and we are seeing also high-frequency indicators including PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index), and trade and more mobility indicators which give us a sense that there is a continued recovery in the first quarter of this year,\" she said. That said, there are some recent emergencies of the new variants in the localised lockdowns that are seen as one of the threats to this recovery, Brooks noted. On the recovery itself, when it comes to the level in terms of the level of output, we are expecting that level to return to the pre-crisis one from 2019 to this fiscal year. That is what we have in our projections. \"However, if you look at a concept of scarring, which just compares what the level of output would have been hadn't there been a crisis in 2024, which is the measure which we are using. Then at and compare where our current growth trajectory is for India that gap is much larger, Brooks said. The gap, she said, which is eight per cent of GDP is significantly larger than what it is for the world as a whole. \"For the world as a whole it's about three (per cent), which is another way of saying that even though in the near term we have this real rebound, there's still scope in the coming years to see higher growth which would reduce and hopefully, eliminate that scarring, which we are currently expecting, the top IMF official said in response to a question. \"If we were to just think about the level of output that it was prior to being a pandemic then that catch happens this year, which is not surprising also given the very high level of the underlying high level of growth which India has. But again, if we compare it to the path of what it would have been without the pandemic then we are getting too many larger gaps there, she said. Noting that the Indian government took several steps to address the COVID-19 crisis, Brooks said, We have seen policy responses, which have been coordinated and in several areas. We have seen that the fiscal support, the monetary easing as well as the liquidity and regulatory measures that were taken.\" What makes sense is to maintain the focus on having that coordinated policy response because this is what's going to prevent long-term damage to the economy. Providing that support to small and medium-sized firms as well as vulnerable houses would be particularly important, she said. Brooks said the IMF very much welcomes the measures that were announced by India during its budget. It is particularly supportive of maintaining the accommodative fiscal stance and also emphasising expenditures on health and infrastructure. We estimate that the positive impact of the measures for this fiscal year is going to be of the order of point six percentage points on growth, she said, adding that several measures announced in the budget were in line of the IMF's advice. Prominent among them are that there would not be a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus at the general government level and also that state governments would be given the temporary flexibility to go over their budget ceilings. And last, but not least, the fact that some of the other budget items on food subsidies were actually brought into the budget. Overall, the IMF is very supportive of this focus on growth. At the same time, Brooks made a strong case for an additional economic stimulus. We do think that additional fiscal stimulus would be helpful. Focusing that stimulus again on the most vulnerable is something that makes sense to us. We note that some of the income support schemes were not extended beyond November 2020 and such, she said. Taking measures in that area would be particularly helpful as well as making sure that there's priority spending on education, the economist noted. Last, but not least, also ensuring that there is a very concrete medium-term fiscal framework is an area where we can see some room for more work in that area, she said. Now when it comes to monetary policy, we think that given the underlying slack in the economy, maintaining the accommodative monetary policy stance makes sense. This is what we understand is being planned at the moment. This has been our long-standing recommendation that we see scope for additional policy measures to address the weaknesses in the financial sector, in the banking part in the non-bank part of the financial sector. We think that this is going to be particularly important as we come out of the crisis to have that efficient credit intermediation, which is going to allow the economy to grow, the IMF official said. Responding to a question on the stimulus package, Brooks underscored the need to essentially have targeted support for households and for the firms that have been most affected is the most efficient and sensible way to provide that support.",

   "text":"There is no eye of newt or toe of frog in  , Robert Zemeckis’ take on the 1983 book — just a mischief of mice, a cantankerous cat, and an occasional s-s-snake. There are people, too; some buzz around in the background while others push the story forward. Chief among these are an unnamed orphan, call him the Boy (Jahzir Bruno, sweetly sensitive), and his loving grandmother (Octavia Spencer), who form a wee bulwark against witches who appear fair but are most foul. Narrated by a distracting Chris Rock, the story primarily takes place in flashback, in 1967, starting with an accident that kills the Boy’s parents. He moves into the Alabama home of his Grandma, whose warm embrace eases his pain. Zemeckis, working from a script written with Kenya Barris and Guillermo del Toro, handles this setup effortlessly, with his two cozily inviting leads, low-key visual panache and customary restive camerawork. Within minutes, Zemeckis has created a vibrantly inhabited world, even if the golden oldies on the soundtrack are overly familiar, as is his habit, and Grandma’s caky cornbread looks more Northern than Southern. The witches sidle in, disguised and cunning. One materialises in a once-upon-a-time tale; another pops up in the present. Amid intimations of doom, Grandma and the Boy decamp to a resort hotel, a nonsensical turn that is effectively a narrative contrivance. There, they soon find themselves facing down a coven of witches stirring up trouble. United by their hatred of children, the twisted sisters are led by the Grand High Witch (an amusing Anne Hathaway), who arrives with a black cat, a trunk stuffed with cash, and a vile plan. Speaking in a vaguely Eastern European accent with Nordic notes, she has a cavernous mouth and jagged teeth right out of del Toro’s imaginarium. Zemeckis improves on the first film adaptation, a 1990 oddity directed by Nicolas Roeg. Here, the Boy feelingly mourns his parents, creating a tangible sense of loss that strengthens the story and raises its stakes. As the Boy heals, Zemeckis pumps up the design and sets his cameras to giddily flying. Everything is slicker and grander in this iteration, including the hotel, which now looks like a supersized plantation. The movie does not do much with this iconography, but it resonates simply because the heroes are now Black. Mostly, the movie is all shivers and silliness until the High Witch and her minions gather. By that point, she has peeled off her wig and bared her sharp teeth, exposing her true evil self. Witches may look like women, as Grandma warns the Boy, but they are demons. Roeg literalised that idea by revealing the High Witch (Anjelica Huston) as a blobby, warty monster who speaks with a German accent and calls her cat “Liebchen.” Hathaway’s witch largely retains her human shape, which only makes her more menacing when she explains her plan. She wants “every child in the vorld rubbed out, squashed.” To do that, the witches will turn children into mice. In his review of the 1990 film, British critic Philip French singled out this scene, noting that “consciously or subconsciously, Dahl is playing with the rhetoric and imagery of the Final Solution.” Zemeckis seems to have tried to attenuate this association by cranking up the comedy and the High Witch’s voice. Even so, the scene retains its queasiness when read through the lens of Dahl’s anti-Semitism. Its macabre humor can be viewed as classic Dahl, a modern riff on a grim fairy tale. But it is also ambiguously coded. The witches are not Nazis; rather, they evoke the demonic figures of blood libel, the slander that Jews ritualistically sacrificed Christian babies.  is not a hate tract; it is just a weird stew of jokes, fantastical turns, swooping cameras, half-baked ideas, and ugly signifiers. It is also a missed opportunity because by not radically upending Dahl’s story, the movie remains burdened by its creepiness. That is too bad, especially given the fruitful liberties this version does take, notably with its casting and shift to the 1960s American South. Even if Zemeckis et al do not do much with this transposition, it is satisfying that the heroes of the story are now a Black child and woman. It works like a charm, for one, and it is not ambiguous at all.",

   "text":"BEIJING: China is planning a mega dam in Tibet able to produce triple the electricity generated by the Three Gorges - the world's largest power station - stoking fears among environmentalists and in neighbouring India. The structure will span the Brahmaputra River before the waterway leaves the Himalayas and flows into India, straddling the world's longest and deepest canyon at an altitude of more than 1,500m. The project in Tibet's Medog County is expected to dwarf the record-breaking Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in central China, and is billed as able to produce 300 billion kilowatts of electricity each year. It is mentioned in China's strategic 14th Five-Year Plan, unveiled in March at an annual rubber-stamp congress of the country's top lawmakers. But the plan was short on details, a timeframe or budget. The river, known as the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibetan, is also home to two other projects far upstream, while six others are in the pipeline or under construction. The \"super-dam\" however is in a league of its own. Last October, the Tibet local government signed a \"strategic cooperation agreement\" with PowerChina, a public construction company specialising in hydroelectric projects. A month later the head of PowerChina, Yan Zhiyong, partially unveiled the project to the Communist Youth League, the youth wing of China's ruling party. Enthusiastic about \"the world's richest region in terms of hydroelectric resources\", Yan explained that the dam would draw its power from the huge drop of the river at this particular section. Beijing may justify the massive project as an environmentally-friendly alternative to fossil fuels, but it risks provoking strong opposition from environmentalists in the same way as the Three Gorges Dam, built between 1994 and 2012. The Three Gorges created a reservoir and displaced 1.4 million inhabitants upstream. \"Building a dam the size of the super-dam is likely a really bad idea for many reasons,\" said Brian Eyler, energy, water and sustainability program director at the Stimson Center, a US think tank. Besides being known for seismic activity, the area also contains a unique biodiversity. The dam would block the migration of fish as well as sediment flow that enriches the soil during seasonal floods downstream, said Eyler. There are both ecological and political risks, noted Tempa Gyaltsen Zamlha, an environmental policy specialist at the Tibet Policy Institute, a think tank linked to the Tibetan government-in-exile based in Dharamshala, India. \"We have a very rich Tibetan cultural heritage in those areas, and any dam construction would cause ecological destruction, submergence of parts of that region,\" he told AFP. \"Many local residents would be forced to leave their ancestral homes,\" he said, adding that the project will encourage migration of Han Chinese workers that \"gradually becomes a permanent settlement\". New Delhi is also worried by the project. The Chinese Communist Party is effectively in a position to control the origins of much of South Asia's water supply, analysts say. \"Water wars are a key component of such warfare because they allow China to leverage its upstream Tibet-centred power over the most essential natural resource,\" wrote political scientist Brahma Chellaney last month in the Times of India. The risks of seismic activity would also make it a \"ticking water bomb\" for residents downstream, he warned. In reaction to the dam idea, the Indian government has floated the prospect of building another dam on the Brahmaputra to shore up its own water reserves. \"There is still much time to negotiate with China about the future of the super-dam and its impacts,\" said Eyler. \"A poor outcome would see India build a dam downstream.\"",

(AP) — A 27-year veteran of the Iowa State Patrol was shot and killed during a violent standoff with a man who fought back against agents in an armored personnel carrier and said he wanted to shoot other officers, authorities said Saturday. Sgt. Jim Smith was killed Friday night in Grundy Center as he and other officers entered the home of Michael Thomas Lang, 41, who fled there after an earlier police pursuit, authorities said. The standoff ended about midnight Friday when a team of highway patrol troopers in an armored personnel carrier smashed into the home. Lang fired multiple shots at the carrier. Three officers inside the carrier returned fire, hitting the man several times, authorities said. Lang was hospitalized in critical condition on Saturday. He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held on $1 million bond. Iowa Department of Public Safety Commissioner Steve Bayens said Smith “died a hero” and “sacrificed himself protecting others.” “We are hurting, we are angry,” Bayens said. “But rest assured we’re not broken. We will continue to shoulder the burdens of our communities while carrying our own. We will continue to stand in the gap of good and evil because, like Jim, that is what we are called to do.” Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of the division of criminal investigation, said events began at 7:22 p.m. on Friday when a Grundy Center officer tried to stop Lang for a traffic violation. Lang was known to Grundy City officers and was not supposed to be driving, he said. Lang fled but eventually stopped and assaulted the officer, Mortvedt said. During the assault, Lang yelled “Shoot Me” at the officer several times, and Lang disarmed the officer of his gun and stun gun and put him in a chokehold, he added. A Grundy County deputy arrived and told Lang to drop his gun. Lang instead yelled “Come get me” and got into his vehicle. He ended up at his home, and several law enforcement officers arrived, Mortvedt said. Lang’s father arrived and told officers his son had multiple weapons in the house. Four Iowa patrol troopers, including Smith, and a K-9 unit, entered the home, and Smith was shot as officers tried to clear the house, he said. Two members of the team retreated into the basement while other officers pulled Smith out. Lang barricaded himself for several hours. Officers who were in the basement said Lang made several statements about shooting Smith and “expressed the desire to shoot more police officers,” he said. About 11:50 p.m., a patrol team tried to enter the home in the armored personnel carrier and exchanged gunfire with Lang, Mortvedt said. No other officers were injured. Gov. Kim Reynolds said she plans to order flags flown at half-staff in Smith’s memory. “It’s with deep sorrow that we recognize the loss of Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Jim Smith, a courageous hero who died in the line of duty,” Reynolds said in a statement Saturday. “Sgt. Jim Smith was a loving husband, father of two, and a pillar of the community. I along with the entire state of Iowa grieve for his family and friends as they try to cope with this devastating loss. Today we are once again reminded of the selfless sacrifices the brave men and women in uniform make. Let us never forget their bravery and that of their loved ones.” Smith is the 11th trooper to die in the line of duty in the patrol’s history. The last death was on Sept. 20, 2011, when Trooper Mark Toney died in a crash in Warren County as he tried to make a traffic stop.",

   "article_summary":"A new documentary, exposes the tricks social-media influencers may use to attain a popular social-media presence",
   "text":"Fake Famous, the HBO Original Documentary, uncovers how an actress, a fashion designer and a real-estate assistant attempt to become social-media influencers by purchasing fake followers and bots to boost their popularity. The about-90-minute-long documentary mocks influencers as it shows how they shape our culture and perceptions of ourselves. The defamatory nature of the documentary has sparked a huge social media outrage, with some calling it even condescending. Controversially, the makers had apparently not sought permission from influencers used as examples in the documentary, before their data was used.   The whole scenario begets the pressing moral question about who’s at fault: is it the influencers who establish a fake image online to attain a popular social-media presence? Or is it the documentary makers who allegedly projected these influencers in a wrong light? \r\nHyderabad-based Y. Kiran Chandra, General Secretary, Free Software Movement of India, articulates that influencers falling for fake followers to fake an image for online popularity are nothing but puppets baited by the business module of corporates such as Facebook and Instagram, which buy and sell followers. “As I see it, the social-media business module is more at fault than the people who buy followers,” states Kiran, emphasising that the morality of the business module that allows for a trade of fake followers and likes and deliberately letting the trend thrive needs to be questioned.   Furthering his argument, Kiran points out that the Internet itself has several algorithms to filter out fake followers. “When a third-party algorithm can do such segregations, corporations such as Facebook or Instagram have access to much more sophisticated algorithms for similar filtrations,” Kiran elaborates. “But they don’t do it precisely because that’s the core of their business module. Both Facebook and Instagram have a system that enables people to pay to increase their likes and followers on their posts, with no transparency in finding out if these likes and followers are real. So to me, the moral fault lies with the corporations that run on this trade.”   \r\nSneha Polapragada, another Hyderabad-based professional who’s a content creator and social media influencer, believes everything on social media revolves around numbers. Emphasising her point, she adds, “Most people are solely focused on increasing the numbers of their followers, likes, etc. So while there’re those who take the effort to authentically increase these numbers by working on their content, almost every second profile on social media, unfortunately, indulges in the scam of purchasing BOT accounts to look popular.”   She admits that audiences get swayed by the opinions of influencers considered experts in their respective domains, but she is clear that the power of content matters. “It takes a lot of time and effort to create content,” articulates Sneha, who nevertheless also believes there is no point in creating content when one cannot actually influence a real audience. “Therefore, these influencers with fake followers reap no real results despite spending money and energy on buying followers and creating content.” Clearly, according to Sneha, to stay relevant online and to create a niche audience for oneself, one must be real and authentic with both one’s content and followers.   Quite differently from Sneha’s thoughts, Mrs Universe 2017 and fitness and fashion influencer Abhimanika Yadav likes to believe that real influencers don’t fake anything and that audiences are the best judge of whom they choose to follow. “I don’t agree with the prefix ‘fake’ before ‘famous’ in the documentary’s title as there are influencers who put up what’s real and their content helps their followers to gain knowledge, stay updated about the latest technologies and fashion and get entertained,” elaborates Abhimanika. “In fact, I don’t think any influencer fakes stuff. They simply put up content that they believe in and have created with a lot of effort, time and energy. They brainstorm and come up with ideas to make their content look interesting and then they add various props and elements to make it attractive.”   \r\nFashion and lifestyle blogger and influencer Esha Hindocha shares her thoughts on how influencers fall into the scam of fake followers. “When people start their influencing journey, they’ve really determined that it will work for them,” says Esha. “It seems like an attractive profession because it looks comparatively easy to earn money on this platform, without either much education or investment. But once you start creating content and uploading it, only then you begin to understand how difficult it is out there to stand out among tons of influencers creating mind-blowing content. Receiving a good fan following is not an easy task as there’s so much content out there that for people to stop by your page, there has to be something really strong and dynamic about yours. But that indirect and unseen competition might also lead to new creators losing confidence and falling into these fake followers and like scams.”   Despite what leads them into purchasing their likes and followers, fake influencers, according to Esha, do not survive on the platform “If you project something you’re not, that game won’t go on for long because at some point, you’ll run out of content,” adds Esha. “I think people who take influencing seriously know the repercussions of doing these things and will stay away from them. For those still doing it just for the numbers, it doesn’t really matter because the engagement rate is like a clear statement of their work. The quality of comments and likes and the quality of their work are equally proportional. The bottom line is you’ll be judged by your content and not the numbers. So, such malpractices won’t take you far, and ironically in this business, there’s no getting away… you just reap what you sow.”  ",

   "article_summary":"'One Night In Miami', about a fictional conversation between Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, Jim Brown, Cassius Clay is a sure-shot Oscar contender",
   "text":"Regina King’s audacity is staggering. Just last year she beat Amy Adams, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz to take home the Oscar for best supporting actress, and now she’s all set to compete with the boys for the director's Oscar. Just this Monday, at the rather white and chauvinistic 87-year-old Venice Film Festival, Regina made history as the first Black woman director to have a film selected.   And now she is going to dominate the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) with   a film that’s set in a room in a Miami motel where four superheroes gather one evening to, well, talk.  Based on the one-act play by Kemp Powers,  … is a fictional account of a real day — Feb. 25, 1964 — the day 22-year-old Cassius Clay (Eli Goree) beat Sonny Liston to become the World’s heavyweight boxing champion. Clay, who called himself The Greatest, emerged from that room to announce that he was embracing the Nation of Islam and discarding his “slave name”. He would soon be known as Muhammad Ali.   Almost exactly a year later, Malcolm X (played with a touch of Barack Obama-like elegance and appropriate self-righteousness by Kingsley Ben-Adir), the Champ’s spiritual and political mentor would be assassinated by the Nation of Islam. What happened in that room? Who else was there?  One Night's sharply written screenplay (by Powers), places Ali’s two friends in the room — singer, songwriter and black rights activist Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr), and NFL star Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge). Regina King’s film first introduces us to its heroes while fawning over them, celebrating their swag.   It opens with Ali beating Henry Cooper at Wembley in 1963, and then sets off to watch him “demolish that ugly beast, Liston”.  It then follows Jim in his sleek, shiny, open-top car as he visits a white well-wisher and benefactor who loves his achievements and can’t stop talking about them, but won’t let a Black man into his house.  then swoons to Sam’s soulful crooning at New York’s famed nightclub, Copacabana, and watches as the white audience grows uneasy and starts to leave.   And then it visits Malcolm X’s simple, austere home, to listen in as he talks to his wife about sexual abuse by the head of Nation of Islam. Lurking outside, he senses, is a threat to his life. The evening is imagined in King's film, and so is the conversation among these four men, who come to celebrate Ali’s win but end up talking politics. But it takes place at a critical intersection of what really was happening in their lives, and in their country. The film places this conversation in the middle of real events and presents us four proud men with powerful personalities. Brief scenes and dialogue add flavour to these full-bodied icons, giving us not just their traits, but also political beliefs and frustrations at having to stand in the margins despite their genius and achievements.    The challenge first comes from Malcolm to Sam, about pandering to a white audience with his “soulful” songs. “Join the fight brother,” he says, and puts on an LP of a white man’s rights anthem to wind him up. It’s Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in The Wind.  Sam and Jim then challenge Malcolm, question his controversial remark on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, berate him for advocating violence, for peddling Islam. They accuse him of “recruiting” Ali who seems naive till he says that though he is not sure about becoming a Muslim, he will join the fight.    In between all these tense, taut moments is Ali, excited and barely able to control a world champion’s trippy, bouncing energy, screaming that he’s the prettiest, fastest. There’s also Sam, and sometimes Jim, sulking at this booze-less party, at having to endure Malcolm’s pulpit-posturing, hectoring and punishing sobriety. Outside the room are two of Malcolm’s alert bodyguards, watching the road, checking who’s coming and going. has arrived in the middle of the growing rage over racism. Through a very powerful, heart-felt monologue delivered by Malcolm, it says, there is no room to stand on the fence anymore, everyone has to pick a side. Because the fight, my brother, is on.   Sam Cooke, both ashamed and inspired by Dylan, would release his song, A Change Is Gonna Come, that has since become a favourite at civil rights rallies. \r\nBut nine months after that evening in a Miami motel, he would be shot dead at a motel in Los Angeles. Two years after that evening in Miami,   would release, starring Jim Brown. That same year, 1966, Ali would become a conscientious objector and refuse to be drafted for the Vietnam War, saying he didn’t believe in it.",

   "text":" It will be a couple's affair when the nominations for the 93rd annual Academy Awards are announced! Global star Priyanka Chopra and singer-actor Nick Jonas will announce the Oscar nominations on March 15. The Academy took to Twitter and revealed that the power couple will announce the nominations in all 23 categories on Monday. The nominations will be announced in two parts via global live streaming.   \"Who's excited for #OscarNoms? Join @priyankachopra and @nickjonas here on Monday at 5:19am PDT. https://twitter.com/i/events/1369298773734682625,\" the tweet read. Priyanka and Nick also shared the news on social media in a video where the 'Mary Kom' actor ended up making a little gaffe. Sharing the video on Instagram, Priyanka used the latest TikTok trend. Priyanka began the video by saying, \"Tell me we are announcing the Oscar nominations without telling me we are announcing Oscar nominations\", a popular trend on Instagram reels and TikTok.   Behind Priyanka, an unimpressed Nick lets her know that she has already told everyone that they are announcing the Oscar nominations. \"Hey @theacademy, any chance I can announce the Oscar nominations solo? Just kidding, love you @nickjonas! We are so excited to be announcing the #OscarNoms on Monday, March 15th at 5:19AM PDT!

Usually scheduled for early February, the ceremony is slated to take place on April 25 this year, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The 93rd Oscars will be televised live on ABC. The actual ceremony was also expected to be a virtual affair, with nominees joining in from their home through video feeds, much like what was seen during the Emmy Awards last year and the Golden Globe Awards more recently. Films like Chloe Zhao's 'Nomadland', Aaron Sorkin's 'The Trial of the Chicago 7', and Emerald Fennell's 'Promising Young Woman' are expected to receive many nominations from the Academy.   Priyanka's latest outing 'The White Tiger' is expected to score several nominations as well. On Tuesday, the film earned two BAFTA nods for Best Screenplay and Best Actor (Male) for Adarsh Gourav. Priyanka, who also starred in the movie, is one of the executive producers of the film.",

   "article_summary":"Look, who hasn't lost a job, and who hasn't dreamed of just wandering?",
   "text":"In these listless Covid times, Chinese-American film director Chloé Zhao’s  , about a woman who travels through the American west in a van after losing her job and her home, seems to be the film of the year. On Sunday,   took home the People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival 2020 (Tiff). Just last Saturday, it received the Golden Lion Award for best film at the 2020 Venice International Film Festival. That’s an accomplishment no other film can lay claim to. Venice is 77 years old, Tiff 45.     stars two-time Oscar winner for best actress, Frances McDormand as Fern, along with many “actual nomads” that Zhao  cast while on her own travels through the area. An adaptation of journalist Jessica Bruder’s non-fiction book, Zhao has scripted and edited the film which is scheduled to release in theatres in December. Two things set apart TIFF from the other film festivals in the group of Big 4 —  Cannes, Venice, Berlin and Toronto. First, unlike the others, TIFF consciously, doggedly and sincerely pursues inclusivity in the films, directors and actors it picks to showcase during the 11-days festival. It also actively seeks to widen and enlighten conversations around films by bringing in \"women, people of colour, people with disabilities, and people from the LGBTQ communities” -- the marginalised, who are often not seen on or behind the screen. Every year TIFF also seeks out and opens its doors to journalists from under-represented sections. That changes not just what we view, but also how we view and talk about films.   Second, TIFF has, over the years, earned a reputation for being what I call the “Oracle of Oscars”. With sharp accuracy, TIFF audiences have been picking and rewarding films that go on to be nominated for various categories at the Oscars, often winning best picture and other awards. All of this year’s top winners at TIFF are directed by women. The first runner-up in the best film category was Regina King’s  , which brings together Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, singer Sam Cooke and NFL legend Jim Brown for one night to discuss race.    For India, however, the film of the year of Covid is most likely Chaitanya Tamhane's   that TIFF’s artistic directors called a “masterfully composed second feature” which “examines a lifetime journey devoted to the art of Indian classical music”. Tamhane’s last film,   was India’s official entry to the Oscars in 2015. It didn’t make it to the nominations. The Oscars are still eight months away — the ceremony will take place on April 25, 2021, and the eligibility criteria has been extended to Feb. 28, 2021. But if TIFF audiences have got it right this time, we may see Tamhane at Hollywood's Dolby Theatre, celebrating a film that tells the story of an “idealistic young performer who dreams of capturing the magic of a musical tradition.”   Or, as one Twitter review described the film, \"AaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaa...\"",

   "text":"There is no eye of newt or toe of frog in  , Robert Zemeckis’ take on the 1983 book — just a mischief of mice, a cantankerous cat, and an occasional s-s-snake. There are people, too; some buzz around in the background while others push the story forward. Chief among these are an unnamed orphan, call him the Boy (Jahzir Bruno, sweetly sensitive), and his loving grandmother (Octavia Spencer), who form a wee bulwark against witches who appear fair but are most foul. Narrated by a distracting Chris Rock, the story primarily takes place in flashback, in 1967, starting with an accident that kills the Boy’s parents. He moves into the Alabama home of his Grandma, whose warm embrace eases his pain. Zemeckis, working from a script written with Kenya Barris and Guillermo del Toro, handles this setup effortlessly, with his two cozily inviting leads, low-key visual panache and customary restive camerawork. Within minutes, Zemeckis has created a vibrantly inhabited world, even if the golden oldies on the soundtrack are overly familiar, as is his habit, and Grandma’s caky cornbread looks more Northern than Southern. The witches sidle in, disguised and cunning. One materialises in a once-upon-a-time tale; another pops up in the present. Amid intimations of doom, Grandma and the Boy decamp to a resort hotel, a nonsensical turn that is effectively a narrative contrivance. There, they soon find themselves facing down a coven of witches stirring up trouble. United by their hatred of children, the twisted sisters are led by the Grand High Witch (an amusing Anne Hathaway), who arrives with a black cat, a trunk stuffed with cash, and a vile plan. Speaking in a vaguely Eastern European accent with Nordic notes, she has a cavernous mouth and jagged teeth right out of del Toro’s imaginarium. Zemeckis improves on the first film adaptation, a 1990 oddity directed by Nicolas Roeg. Here, the Boy feelingly mourns his parents, creating a tangible sense of loss that strengthens the story and raises its stakes. As the Boy heals, Zemeckis pumps up the design and sets his cameras to giddily flying. Everything is slicker and grander in this iteration, including the hotel, which now looks like a supersized plantation. The movie does not do much with this iconography, but it resonates simply because the heroes are now Black. Mostly, the movie is all shivers and silliness until the High Witch and her minions gather. By that point, she has peeled off her wig and bared her sharp teeth, exposing her true evil self. Witches may look like women, as Grandma warns the Boy, but they are demons. Roeg literalised that idea by revealing the High Witch (Anjelica Huston) as a blobby, warty monster who speaks with a German accent and calls her cat “Liebchen.” Hathaway’s witch largely retains her human shape, which only makes her more menacing when she explains her plan. She wants “every child in the vorld rubbed out, squashed.” To do that, the witches will turn children into mice. In his review of the 1990 film, British critic Philip French singled out this scene, noting that “consciously or subconsciously, Dahl is playing with the rhetoric and imagery of the Final Solution.” Zemeckis seems to have tried to attenuate this association by cranking up the comedy and the High Witch’s voice. Even so, the scene retains its queasiness when read through the lens of Dahl’s anti-Semitism. Its macabre humor can be viewed as classic Dahl, a modern riff on a grim fairy tale. But it is also ambiguously coded. The witches are not Nazis; rather, they evoke the demonic figures of blood libel, the slander that Jews ritualistically sacrificed Christian babies.  is not a hate tract; it is just a weird stew of jokes, fantastical turns, swooping cameras, half-baked ideas, and ugly signifiers. It is also a missed opportunity because by not radically upending Dahl’s story, the movie remains burdened by its creepiness. That is too bad, especially given the fruitful liberties this version does take, notably with its casting and shift to the 1960s American South. Even if Zemeckis et al do not do much with this transposition, it is satisfying that the heroes of the story are now a Black child and woman. It works like a charm, for one, and it is not ambiguous at all.",

   "text":"ABOARD A US MILITARY AIRCRAFT: Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday (Apr 10) discussed with his Philippine counterpart China’s recent positioning of “militia vessels” near the Philippines in the South China Sea. Austin spoke by phone with Philippine Secretary of National Defense Delfin Lorenzana while Austin was flying from Washington to Israel to begin an international trip. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Austin and Lorenzana discussed the situation in the South China Sea and the recent massing of Chinese vessels at Whitsun Reef, which has drawn criticism from Manila. China has said its vessels are there for fishing. In their phone call, Austin proposed to Lorenzana several measures to deepen defence cooperation, including by “enhancing situational awareness of threats in the South China Sea”, Kirby said. He did not elaborate. Kirby said earlier this week that the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group, as well as the amphibious ship USS Makin Island, are operating in the South China Sea. The US has no military forces based permanently in the Philippines but sometimes rotates forces to the country under the US-Philippines Visiting Forces Agreement. The recent gathering of Chinese vessels near the Philippines is among moves the United States has criticised as efforts by Beijing to intimidate smaller nations in the region.",

   "text":"Oscar-winning filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho has spoken out against the anti-Asian hate in the US, saying that attacks on the minority communities make him feel \"quite fearful\". The   director made the comments during an interview at Chapman University’s Dodge College in Orange, California, reported  . When asked about the incidents of racial discrimination and violence towards Asian people, Bong, who was speaking through a translator from his home in South Korea, said he has an outsider perspective on the issue. \"But as someone who is a part of mankind, as a person, it’s quite fearful to watch the hate crimes against Asian-Americans and the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement,\" he said. Bong said directors and creators should be bolder when dealing with current issues of society. \"I do think about what the film industry can do at this time. With films, creating a film takes a lot of time and a lot of money; it's a big unit that can’t really respond quickly to issues that are currently happening in society,\" he said. \"But ironically, because of that, I think creators and filmmakers can be bolder with dealing with issues and they shouldn’t be afraid to confront them,\" he added. Referring to filmmaker Spike Lee’s 1989 movie  , Bong said the film is a perfect example of how directors can address societal issues through their work. \"Not necessarily to predict what will happen in society, but to use your insight to portray the issues that are currently boiling underneath the surface of society that can explode later on,\" he added. The filmmaker said he tried to follow Lee's method with his 2019 social satire  , which became the first South Korean movie to win the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020. \"For me,   was a film where I tried to take that approach… (the film) talks about the haves and have-nots of our current society. It began with a question of ''what does it mean to be poor or rich in our current times?'' \"As creators and artists, you sort of have to see through the essence and the central questions in our society through the days that you live through and send a reply to those questions through your work,\" Bong said. The South Korean filmmaker's comments come weeks after six women of Asian descent were among eight people killed by a gunman in a series of shootings at massage parlours in Georgia, US.",

   "article_summary":"Actress Malvika Sharma has started practicing as a junior lawyer in the High Court",
   "text":"While we have watched actresses turning into lawyers in films, an actress has recently turned into a lawyer in real life. Having completed her LLB from Rizvi Law College in Mumbai in November 2020, actress Malvika Sharma is now also a practicing junior lawyer in the Hyderabad High Court. Of course, Malvika is delighted with the new tag she has of a junior lawyer. \r\n“It’s an overwhelming feeling because being a lawyer is what I’ve been working towards for the last few years,” explains Malvika, who has got my license in January 2021 from the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa.   Incidentally, the actress would be soon giving her all-India examination later this year, she tells us. “I was supposed to give that exam in January but then I was promoting my film Red, and so I couldn’t,” says the actress. Despite two films in her kitty, and those with top names in the industry, the most defining achievement in the  actress’s life appears to be her lawyer’s degree. For one, she says it made her more confident. “When I was holding my degree and license in my hand, it was a very emotional moment,” Malvika expresses.   What’s more, the confidence even rubbed off on her personality. “I started to become more positive; a Law degree gives crazy confidence, and it added a different dimension to my personality. Then, from the day I got my license I started feeling more liberated in ways I’ve never felt earlier,” she elaborates. Not the one to stop at a bachelor’s degree, Malvika has even applied for admission into LLM from Mumbai University. Now, having cleared the entrance test for the Master’s, she is eyeing at a specialisation in criminology.   While Malvika hasn’t yet argued a case in the High Court, the actress states that the experience of going to the court, understanding the cases and insights has been a great experience in itself. “It is such a learning experience that I’ve understood it requires a lot of hard work to break down the details of a case. For starters, I’ve realised studying and practicing law are completely different from each other,” says the actress, adding that acquiring practical knowledge by dealing in live cases requires a lot of patience.   In fact, initially, she didn’t even understand most of the court jargon. “I had to either Google them or find out about them by calling up my lawyer friends,” she explains. “I realised what we study is completely different from what we experience at work. We need to understand the terms to argue in the court of law. So also, while I’ve been making constant efforts to get used to the terminologies, my experience of being in the court as an intern has helped me a lot, too.” Life, however, is getting a little tighter for the Red actress. For instance, even as she’s been preparing for her LLM on one side, she has been shooting for ad and commercials on the other.   “And I am practicing, so it’s just becoming hectic and I am having a tough time preparing for my LLM because of the time constraints,” says the actress, adding that if she were to get three days in a week, she’d prefer to use those to focus on her studies. “In fact, after my graduation, I’ve understood what it is to be a lawyer.” Despite admitting the challenges of studying, shooting and practicing all at once, Malvika says she constantly strives to strike a balance between all of them. “I’ve already started going to court and have been studying a few cases,” she explains, while thanking her senior, Advocate V Pattabhi for constantly supporting her and understanding the demands of the acting profession, especially when she has to rush out for an impromptu shooting assignment, leaving behind important details of a case.   So what are her plans? Have films taken a back seat? Does she plan to continue with her lawyer practice? “I am just going with the flow,” she replies matter-of-factly, but not before adding that a new title against her name hasn’t changed her perception of looking at scripts. “I’ll always look at a script in the totality of a film. Moreover, I am still keen on being an actor because the kind of high I get being in front of the camera is inexplicable. You have a great opportunity to be someone else. In fact, acting has always been my first love and I’ll be a little partial towards acting,” she says. \r\nAnd why not, we wonder, because as she tells us, it was acting that prompted her to get a lawyer’s degree in the first place.  ",

   "article_summary":"Experts say it is better that patients put off their surgeries in case they are not urgent",
   "text":" Patients who clear the Covid-19 test before going for elective surgeries for kidney, liver and cardiac diseases are ending up testing positive in post-operative wards.  Their testing positive post surgery is being attributed to their lungs having the typical scarring of Covid-19. A senior doctor of a private hospital, on condition of anonymity, said, they had had 10 such patients. “In three of these cases, the patient’s lungs turned out to be fully white, which means they were filled with virus. This is worrisome,\" the doctor said. Similar cases are being reported from other hospitals too.   There is suspicion that this could be hospital-acquired Covid-19. This is because patients, especially in-patients, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 that is in the hospital for more than two hours, according to a study carried out by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB). While both government and private hospitals have separate pathways for Covid-19 patients, it is worrisome that other patients end up contracting the virus. A senior infection control specialist, who chose to remain anonymous, said, \"These cases are being noted despite our infection control protocols, as the virus movement in the hospital air is high. The other alternative could be that the number of asymptomatic carriers in the public is very high. Contacts of healthcare workers, patient caregivers and family members interact with society, leading to transmission and movement of virus. As immune-compromised are susceptible to virus, they are acquiring it.\"   Hospitals are finding it difficult to explain this challenge to patients who pick up the infection post surgery. Elective surgeries are finalised on various parameters, including when mere medication is no more effective. Patients have no option but opt for surgery. \"Separate pathways in hospitals require extensive care and extremely strong protocols, which healthcare workers have to follow. In the second Coronavirus wave, it is estimated that every fourth person is a carrier of virus. We are approaching a peak. During this time, it is better that patients put off their surgery in case it is not required urgently,\" a senior doctor said.   Similarly, senior citizens and other immune-compromised patients must not be called to hospitals for counselling for fear of them contracting virus in the air. They must be provided online consultation for some time to come. Dr Mustufa Afzal, senior infectious disease specialist at Care Hospitals, said, \"In the second wave, those with comorbid conditions are getting serious within 12 to 24 hours. The spike of virus within the body is immediate, and double mutant is a cause for concern.\" Dr Ashih Chauhan, senior general physician, said, \"Many patients are insisting on hospital admissions when it is not necessary. Trusting your family physician and opting for online consultation is the best way to protect oneself from variants of the virus. Patients panicking only aggravate their situation, as their basic parameters of blood pressures and sugars heighten in such circumstances.\"  ",

   "text":"Indicting West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for Model Code of Conduct violations over her continuous tirade against the Central paramilitary forces and her recent diktat to “gherao” them during the remaining phases of the Assembly elections in the state, the Election Commission severely reprimanded the Trinamul Congress supremo in yet another notice on Thursday night and sought her explanation by 11 am on Saturday. Finding her allegations “completely false, provocative and intemperate” statements, the EC said Ms Banerjee’s attacks and “attempts to berate and vilify the Central paramilitary forces during the electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation among the rank and file of these forces, who have been rendering yeoman’s service since the late 1980s in election after election….”   It also noted that the two-time CM “has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central paramilitary forces… Far more discouraging is the fact that Ms Banerjee has been trying to make an emotional pitch for women voters to go to the extent of inciting them to attack the personnel of CPFs. It is extremely unfortunate that political battles are thus sought to be fought in this manner instead of being fought on the campaign trail etc.” Ms Banerjee, according to the EC, “is perhaps not realising that this kind of statement can create a wedge of distrust between the state police of West Bengal, who are also doing their own duty with the Central forces, instead of complementing each other. In fact, Ms Banerjee is sparing no efforts to ensure that a deep wedge and drift is created amongst them which is bound to have serious consequential damage even after the process of elections is over.”   Union home minister Amit Shah, who was in the city on Friday for the poll campaign, tore into the TMC chief over her all-out criticism of the Central forces and the accusations against him. Rejecting her claims, he observed that he had never heard of “a CM of a state or the head of a political party making attacking comments on the Central forces like Ms Banerjee.” Mr Shah urged the TMC chief to apply her “common sense”, reminding her of the “control” of the EC, instead of his ministry, on the Central forces during the polls. He also argued that Ms Banerjee has been “frustrated”, realising that she was facing defeat in the polls, which is reflected in her comments. “She should reply to the notice from the EC to her,” the Union home minister said.   The TMC chief, however, remained defiant despite the massive pressure that is mounting on her since this was the second notice in a gap of 24 hours to her from the EC over her violations of the MCC.  “I will keep talking against the CRPF and BSF as long as they are with the BJP. Otherwise, I will salute them. I respect and salute the jawans of our country. However, I would not do the same to those who are working on the instructions of Mr Shah. I will better die rather than saluting Mr Shah,” she told a TMC rally at Jamalpur in Burdwan East.",

   "text":"The central bank yesterday extended the banking hours by half an hour after clients rushed up to branches to withdraw cash as the country is set to go into a strict lockdown from April 14 to tame the raging coronavirus.    Clients can carry out transactions between 10:00 am and 1:00 pm on April 12 and April 13, according to a central bank notice. The Bangladesh Bank had shortened the banking hours from 10:00 am to 12:30 pm on April 4, after the government announced a lockdown-like restriction, banning transport movement and closing shops for a week from April 5.  But the coronavirus situation has not improved. Instead, the number of infections and deaths is rising alarmingly. This prompted the government to come up with a strict countrywide lockdown from April 14.   Bankers of Sonali Bank, Southeast Bank, and South Bangla Agriculture and Commerce said many clients apprehended that banks might remain closed during the all-out lockdown. Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader and State Minister for Public Administration Farhad Hossain on Friday said that the government was considering a strict lockdown for a week from April 14. This has created the rush at the banks' premises to withdraw money as people feel comfortable keeping cash at hand at the time of crisis. Yesterday's BB notice did not say anything about the banking hours during the strict lockdown period. However, several central bankers have ruled out any closure of banks and suggested people not be worried. The central bank is working to keep available cash at automated teller machines. Customers will also avail of banking services through digital platforms from anywhere and anytime. The central bank has already increased the transaction ceiling under the booming mobile financial service (MFS) during the lockdown. A client can now send Tk 200,000 per month instead of the previous ceiling of Tk 75,000. Besides, people will not count any charge in sending a maximum of Tk 40,000 per month. Clients are allowed to send Tk 10,000 per transaction without any cost. Earlier, an individual was charged Tk 5 to send money to another person.  ",

In Bengal, only Narendra Modi`s strategy will work,\" Rajib told ANI.  An audio chat of `Club House room` involving Prashant Kishor and a few journalists went viral on social media. \"There is no anti-incumbency against Modi.  Modi has become a cult in the country. Modi is popular in Bengal. The Hindi speaking people is the core support base of BJP in Bengal. Modi is very popular here. Modi and Mamata are equally popular in Bengal,\" Kishore said in that conversation.  \"When we made a survey and asked people whose government will be formed in Bengal. The outcomes predominantly come in favour of the BJP. The majority says BJP`s government will be formed. There are sufficient workers of BJP on the ground. If we leave one or two districts, everywhere there are strong cadets of BJP,\" added Kishor. \"Suvendu is not a factor. Hindus, schedule caste, Dalit and Hindi speaking population are the key factors. Around 50-55 per cent of Hindus are voting for BJP. There are around one crore Hindi speaking population in West Bengal.  Matuas will predominantly vote for the BJP. When we made a survey and asked people whose government will be formed in Bengal. The outcomes predominantly comes in favour of BJP. In-ground there are workers of BJP,\" explained Kishor.  He further said the parties like Congress, Left and TMC have been practising appeasement politics in West Bengal.  \"For the last 20 years, there has been a blatant effort to appease the minority. The entire political ecosystem in Bengal be it Left, Congress or Didi have been to grab the Muslim votes. There is some element that BJP is exploiting. And that element is coming from the blatant misuse of minority politics,\" Kishor stated.  The election strategist was roped in by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) for the West Bengal Assembly Elections 2021.  Meanwhile, voting for 44 constituencies in West Bengal`s fourth phase Assembly elections began at 7 am on Saturday amid tight security. This phase of the elections will witness an intense battle between 373 candidates in 44 constituencies of the state across five districts -- Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly.  Among the 44 constituencies, nine are in Howrah, 10 in Hooghly, 11 in South 24 Parganas, five in Alipurduar and nine in Cooch Behar. A total of 1,15,81,022 voters will participate in this phase, out of which 2,63,016 are first-time voters. The fifth phase of the Assembly elections will commence on April 17. The counting of votes will take place on May 2.",

   "text":"SINGAPORE: Singaporean businesses, like other enterprises in Myanmar, have been trying to navigate the turbulent waves created by the military coup on Feb 1. Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.",

   "text":"SINGAPORE: The soft crunch of footsteps on fallen leaves, the twitter of birds and the occasional rustling of branches as long-tailed macaques hop from tree to tree. This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir. “I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week. These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago. But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him. What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said. Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes. He added: \"There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.\" The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today. Just a few weeks ago, a   with improved accessibility. Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail. Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030. This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too. Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish. Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of. Singapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case. “A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department. “The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said. In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper. This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a  . Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah. Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said. But even then, these nature spots were not popular. “No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard. “People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.” “So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said. Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed. The 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”. By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas. The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG. All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation. “(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard. Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said. Today, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002. To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks. They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA. These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said. Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene. The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors. Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA. Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011. Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity. In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a \"City in a Garden\". This goal would evolve to become a \"City in Nature\" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans. Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape. The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River. “If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches. “You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.” “But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said. More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said. Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho. Having more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking. Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media. “People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old. But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic. A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April. One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew. This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces. “Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian. NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000. The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said. Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central). Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru. Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks.  He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah). Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense. The boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts. Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves. “That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said. “I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’” Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly. “Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said. Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted. “It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’” In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails. “We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian. This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned. At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble. This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said. “Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them. “While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said. But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails. NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same. Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it. On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.\" He added that park facilities can be seen as a \"manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”. Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature. “Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).” “Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine. “Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said. Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette. Social graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its \"City in Nature\" vision, experts said.  will be done by 2030. Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”. Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said. It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said. Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down. On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added. Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails. “This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside. “(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho. He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice. To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate. Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation. He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal. There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”. “The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.” He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets. “This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said. While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes. “Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before. “I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.",

   "text":"Maharashtra, which were shut since the imposition of COVID-19 lockdown in March, reopened on Monday with devotees visiting some of the prominent temples and shrines in the state. The reopening of the places of worship in Maharashtra coincided with the Diwali ‘Padwa’, which is an important festival in the state. Early in the morning, devotees were seen visiting Lord Vitthal’s temple at Pandharpur in Satara, Saibaba’s shrine in Shirdi, Goddess Tulja Bhavani’s temple in Osmanabad and the famous Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai. The Siddhivinayak temple’s chairman Aadesh Bandekar on Sunday said only 1,000 devotees will be allowed inside the temple every day in staggered time slots to be booked through a mobile phone application. As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the state government, religious places located out of COVID-19 containment zones have been allowed to reopen as per the timings decided by authorities, and devotees will be allowed inside in a staggered manner. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced reopening of the places of worship, but also cautioned people, saying it cannot be forgotten that the “demon of coronavirus” still persists and called for following discipline. The opposition BJP in the state had been seeking reopening of the places of worship and earlier questioned the Thackeray governments decision to not reopen temples at a time when bars were allowed to reopen. The chief minister, however, had defended his decision saying it was difficult to follow physical distancing at the places of worship. The issue had also led to a stand-off between Thackeray and state Governor B S Koshyari, who reminded the Shiv Sena president of his Hindutva credentials and asked if he had turned secular. Koshyari’s letter to the chief minister was criticised by constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. Thackeray had said that after places of worship are reopened, rules and safety protocols have to be followed strictly, and laid stress on wearing masks. “If we follow discipline, we will get God’s blessings,” Thackeray had said. According to the SOPs laid down by the government, only asymptomatic people will be allowed inside places of worship and wearing of face mask is mandatory for devotees. The number of people to be allowed inside such places in a particular time slot will be decided on the size of the structure and ventilation. Devotees will have to maintain social distancing, while management of such places will have to conduct thermal scanning and make available hand wash or sanitisers, according to the SOPs. Local authorities of Maharashtra can further add any directions to these guidelines taking into consideration local conditions. Footwear should be preferably taken off inside vehicles, the guidelines said. Touching of statues, holy books, idols is not allowed and large gatherings continue to remain prohibited. In view of the potential threat of spread of the coronavirus infection, only recorded devotional music should be played, and choir or singing groups are not allowed, as per the SOPs. Among other guidelines, common prayer mats should be avoided and devotees should bring their own prayer mats or pieces of cloth, which they can take back with them. Physical offering of ‘prasad’, distribution or sprinkling of holy water is not allowed. Floors at places of worship should be cleaned multiple times in a day, and community kitchens and ‘langars’ should follow physical distancing, the guidelines said. Effective sanitisation of the premises should be done with a particular focus on lavatories, and hand and foot washing stations. Workers at places of worship will have to undergo pre-joining and weekly COVID-19 tests for highly exposed groups, as per the SOPs.",

   "text":"India and Japan are planning to hold a '2+2' format meeting of foreign and defence ministers in Tokyo later this month, Japanese media reported.   According to NHK, Japanese Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu and Defence Minister Kishi Nobuo are due to attend the meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.  This will the second such meeting between the two countries as the inaugural meeting of the India-Japan Foreign and Defence Ministerial Dialogue (2+2) was held on November 30, 2019, in New Delhi.  According to Asia Nikkei, this comes as China ramps up its activities in the disputed East and South China Seas.   Meanwhile, Japan's Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide is also making arrangements to visit India. The ministers are expected to discuss ways to cooperate more closely on defence.   Japan and India signed an agreement last year to allow the Self-Defence Forces and the Indian military to provide each other with food and fuel.   The NHK, in a report, said that the Japanese government is increasingly looking to India as an ally that shares basic values and can help work toward a free and open Indo-Pacific as China continues to assert itself across the region. Both India and Japan time and again have asserted that they are committed to efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific.   Last month, the leaders of the Quad alliance, India, the US, Japan and Australia had underscored the importance of a 'free and open' Indo-Pacific region during the group's first-ever leaders' summit.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that Quad has now come of age and will serve as an important pillar in ensuring the stability of the Indo-Pacific region.  The Asia-Pacific region features several territorial disputes in the South China and East China seas, which involve Brunei, China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.   (With inputs from agencies) ",

   "text":"A political controversy erupted in West Bengal during the fourth phase of the elections when BJP's IT cell released an audiotape of Trinamool' election strategist Prashant Kishor where he was heard saying a 'ClubHouse' chat that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hugely popular in West Bengal and this is one of the factors that will decide which party sweeps the state. BJP's IT cell chief Amit Malviya claimed that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's election strategist Prashant Kishor had accepted the BJP's victory. Malviya shared the audio of Prashant Kishor's discussion on the ClubHouse platform on social media. In this, Kishor is chatting with some journalists. In a public chat on ClubHouse, Mamata Banerjee's election strategist concedes that even in TMC's internal surveys, BJP is winning. The vote is for Modi, polarisation is a reality, the SCs (27 per cent of WB's population), Matuas are all voting for the BJP, Amit Malviya- National in-charge of BJP's Information & Technology department wrote in his tweet. In the audio, Kishor is saying that on a public chat at the clubHouse, Prashant Kishor admitted that BJP is winning in TMC's internal survey too. People are voting for Modi and polarization has taken place. SC and Matua, 27 per cent of Bengal's population all voted for the BJP. Another candid admission by Kishor is that -- all that the Left, Congress and TMC ecosystem have done in the last 20 years is Muslim appeasement. The implication, It has resulted in resentment on the ground. The speakers had not realised that the chat was public, Malviya wrote. That moment when Mamata Banerjee's strategist realised that the ClubHouse room was open and his admissions were being heard by the public at large and not just a handful of Lutyens journalist. Deafening silence followed, Malviya added. Prashant Kishor was immediate to react. \"I am happy that the people of BJP are taking my clubHouse chat more seriously than the statements of their leaders. I appeal to them to release the entire conversation except for some part of the chat. In the part that has been released, the question was being answered about how BJP is getting 40 per cent votes and how it has been thinking that the BJP is winning. He also said through social media that the BJP will not be able to cross the 100 mark in Bengal elections\" Kishore tweeted.",

   "text":"On the contrary, a little bit innovation from our ends could turn things around. After all, isn't this what the pandemic has taught us? That we can, and must work with whatever options we are given. Yes, we are speaking about an easy alternative, such as the replica-grass laden veranda, or the hand-crafted rug placed over the concrete on the rooftop. We can have our mini picnics right at these spots, at the comfort of our very homes, with our loved ones around. A mini basket full of home-baked goodies, fresh fruits and lots of iced tea would enhance our experience. To this, we can add calm retro music or some soothing jazz tunes, especially to match the mood of the afternoon. Few scrambled ideas for the entire day could be to turn the environment into a mini courtyard fit for the queen and the king. Strings of paper lanterns can be used as decorative elements, a splurge can be made out of cushy pillows, decorative furs and a karaoke microphone for singing out loud our favourite tracks.                             At Star Lifestyle, we never miss out on the fashion and the styling suggestions, which we believe, is one of the most integral part of any get-together. This year, try wearing pure-cotton dresses in check prints or the plain khadi for these 'stay-at-home' picnics. Indigo tie-dyes also look brilliant when aesthetically imprinted over the ivory white dress. Make sure you wear a fashionable hat or a matching scarf to match the sensibility of the occasion. Both kitten heels and flats go wonderfully well with the occasion and the loose — flowy, pure  cottons that we suggest you should be wearing. If an occasional pigeon comes now and then, to enjoy your picnic alongside your immediate family, consider your hard-work a success.   \n",

   "text":"Last year, when the entire world stalled and the lockdowns were phasing in and out within the boundaries of every nation, Durjoy Rahman, the founder of Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation spent a lot more time thinking about the artisans hailing from the rural communities of our country — how they would lead their lives when practically every sort of income mechanism had been disrupted. This is when the art connoisseur decided to collaborate with Kamruzzaman Shadhin, Gidree Bawlee Foundation of Arts, to launch 'Bhumi' (Earth), a project to support creative communities of the Thakurgaon district during the COVID-19 crisis. \"I had to start somewhere, and Thakurgaon seemed to be the right place to begin such a mega-scale project, since there are hundreds of traditional craftsmen out there, especially from indigenous communities such as Santals, Rajbongshi and others who were looking for support,\" Durjoy elaborated. This project catered to around 60 families with more than 250 members. The four–month long project had been developed meticulously to tackle the preliminary stages of the economic downturn faced by the resident communities, an after-effect of the sprawling pandemic. \"We planned on the project to help the community of artisans 'up-north' and make their craftsmanship identified and celebrated, to the entire nation. But somehow, luckily, our works surpassed the boundaries and became a worldwide sensation, with popular news outlet CNN featuring our story to the global audience,\" said Durjoy. And true it was, the drone shots of the seed bed by renowned nature photographer, Firoz Al Sabah made several rounds on social media, with praises pouring in from all corners of the world for the remarkable flair of the agricultural farmers. The project also highlighted the works of the jute artisans for their innovative scarecrow construction, the bamboo artisans, the distinctive fabric weavers, and the satranji (handcrafted rug) weavers of the district. \"We took the virgin (never-been-farmed) land on lease, to grow vegetables on a designed seedbed, with 'zero use' of modern-day technology or any sort of harmful pesticides. The seedbed had been shaped in the form of a buffalo and then when we took a drone shot, it turned out to be a huge sensation, with incredible representation of the ancient farming methodologies. My personal feeling is that I have been associated with a huge number of artists over the years, but Bhumi educated me in ways that are beyond comprehension. And I am glad to have been associated with such an auspicious project from the planning stage.\" \"I also want people at large to know that DBF (Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation) does not believe in abandoning a community after a project work is completed; we keep regular contact with the artisans associated with Bhumi till date, and help them through every means possible, whenever necessary,\" he said. Inquired about the future prospects of similar projects, Durjoy revealed that he always wants DBF to be associated with similarly industrious and inspiring projects. \"Art is existent everywhere, in every form in every place and bringing that art to the forefront is our duty. DBF wants to inspire people. My dream is to establish DBF as a platform, where young, rising artists with impeccable talents can come and connect with ease. We are here to represent Bangladesh in its truest form, from the peripheries to the urban cities,\" said Durjoy. At the end of our rendezvous with Durjoy Rahman, we had one question placed in front of him. How do you want people to remember DBF in the long term? \"Just as an institution that is trying hard to make an impact on human lives via art and culture,\" reflected the art connoisseur.   \n",

   "text":"’ Chris Wallace on Sunday questioned Texas Gov. Greg Abbott about why he had attacked the Biden administration over reports of sexual assault at a migrant shelter despite being silent on the matter when   was in office. Abbott, a Republican,   Wednesday that his state had received complaints of sexual abuse at a federal facility that houses migrant youth. Abbott blamed President  ’s immigration policies and called for the facility to be shut down. But immigrant advocates condemned Abbott’s press conference as political theater, noting that he failed to speak up over   at immigrant detention centers during the Trump administration. “Governor, there were thousands of complaints of sexual assault at migrant shelters during the Trump years,” Wallace said   with Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” “Not to say that what’s going on now is right, but we couldn’t find one instance of you complaining and calling that out when President Trump was president.” Abbott said there were “multiple differences” between how the Trump and Biden administrations handled the alleged sexual abuse, including the “constant communication” his office received from Trump officials on the matter. He went on to suggest that he was fully aware of the migrant sexual assault allegations during the Trump administration but didn’t speak out at the time because those complaints were filed with federal agencies. “The one that I talked about earlier this past week were reports that were filed with state agencies,” Abbott said. “So we have a duty to respond to any complaint about child sexual abuse as well as to investigate it and that’s exactly what I did to make sure it was addressed.” “Don’t fall prey to Democrats or others saying, ‘Well, Abbott didn’t complain about this in the past,’” he added. “What they need to focus on is exactly what I called attention to last month in Dallas, Texas, where I pointed out then that there were going to be instances of child sex abuse taking place.” The sex abuse Abbott cited Wednesday allegedly took place at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. More than 1,300 teens who crossed the border into the U.S. from Mexico without a parent or guardian are reportedly being held there. “In short, this facility is a health and safety nightmare,” Abbott told reporters Wednesday. “The Biden administration is now presiding over the abuse of children.” From 2014 to 2018, under the Obama administration and subsequent Trump presidency, the Department of Health and Human Services received more than 4,500 complaints of sexual harassment and abuse against government-run migrant shelters,  . “The only reason why Abbott is now acting like he cares about the children in these facilities is for political reasons,” Jonathan Ryan, CEO of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, said in a statement. “What the governor wants is for the Biden administration to stop allowing children to seek home and safety in this country,” Ryan added. “That is not the solution to the challenge we have in front of us. We must ensure the children are released as soon as possible and be reunited with their families in the U.S.” Watch Abbott’s full appearance on “Fox News Sunday” below.",

   "article_summary":"\"Brandon Bernard was a different person from the teenager arrested over 20 years earlier. Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed.\"",
   "text":"Brandon Bernard called and emailed me daily in the two months before his execution. We spoke a few hours before he was executed and some of our last words were spent discussing his last words. For the first time, his optimism was gone. Even the day before, he sounded hopeful because he had heard that the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney  .  Brandon read his speech to the Pardon Office to me before presenting it, and the profound level of remorse he expressed brought me to tears. He was a different person from the teenager arrested over 20 years earlier. Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed. I began writing to death row prisoners after reading Bryan Stevenson’s book   about an innocent man condemned to death row. Books often change my course; I read   a few years ago and haven’t eaten meat since. After reading “Just Mercy,” I sent out postcards to about a dozen death row inmates across the U.S. When I started what my husband, family and friends universally consider an odd hobby, I had no idea how gratifying and life-altering writing death row prisoners would become.   When we first began exchanging letters a year ago, I warned Brandon that I had one other pen pal at Terre Haute federal penitentiary. In my experience, inmates do not want to write someone with multiple pen pals at the same facility out of legitimate concerns over privacy and safety. Brandon’s immediate response was, “Well, then that makes me one of the two luckiest men at Terre Haute.” To call himself lucky after over   23 hours a day in a six-by-eight-foot cell was the first of many lessons in gratitude Brandon taught me. Brandon was 18 when he took part in a robbery gone wrong. He had no prior history of violence. Brandon’s friends carjacked a white couple, Todd and Stacey Bagley, youth ministers innocently offering a ride to kids purportedly in need. Later, Brandon rejoined the group only to see Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the crime, fatally shoot Todd and Stacey in the head at close range. The man who had just shot two people in the head and still had a gun in his hand then ordered Brandon and three other teens to set the car on fire with the couple’s bodies inside.    At trial,  , meaning he offered the jury no alternative perspective on the charges. Brandon was the only accomplice not given an opportunity to plead guilty. The other accomplices pleaded out and received prison sentences; two are home with their families now.  Brandon was falsely portrayed as a hardened high-level gang member. Prosecutors suppressed evidence by their own gang expert that the gang had a 13-tier hierarchy with  . Brandon never got the chance to clarify his case in court — it remained the story poorly told at trial two decades earlier. Five of the nine surviving jurors  , stating that they would not have voted for the death penalty had prosecutors disclosed all facts at trial and had Brandon’s own lawyer competently defended him.   In her dissent written hours before Brandon’s execution, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor   “despite troubling allegations that the Government secured his death sentence by withholding exculpatory evidence and knowingly eliciting false testimony against him. [He] has never had the opportunity to test the merits of those claims in court. Now he never will.” Brandon became the youngest person, based on age when the offense occurred, to be put to death by the federal government in nearly 70 years,  . He was 40 when he died.  Brandon loved his life, even in its limited capacity on death row.   in his decades behind bars. This is no small feat given that death row is like a prison within a prison, with countless oppressive rules and ensuing frustrations.  Brandon mainly spent his time mentoring at-risk youth, reading, crocheting and playing the guitar. Brandon was calmer and more patient than most people I’ve come across; he spoke slowly and thoughtfully and was an avid listener. He never cursed and when I asked if that was for religious reasons, he said, “No, cursing just feels too aggressive to me.” A few days before his execution, Brandon’s family visited him for the last time.  After the visit, Brandon told me there was a hole in the pane of glass. I naively said, “Oh, so you were able to hold hands.” He explained it was an air hole to speak through, not large enough for hands, “But,” he said, “I could smell my mom.” In 20 years, including in his final days, Brandon was never allowed to physically touch a loved one. Never having physical contact is an inhumane daily assault on the soul. Brandon’s case fits the death row profile: His crime and trial took place in Texas, a state that has   of the national total. Brandon’s jury consisted of  . Brandon was Black — despite being 13% of the U.S. population, Blacks   of death row inmates. The victims are white in   of homicide death penalty cases. A recent   found that in executions involving interracial murders since 1976, 295 Black defendants were executed for killing white victims, while only 21 white defendants were executed for killing Black victims. Death row is riddled with racial bias and is disproportionately home to Black men   against a white person. Fairness cannot be achieved. Executions in our country, whether with rope or needle, have always been about race. President Joe Biden has   and to give incentives for states to do the same. There is a simple alternative to government executions: Keep people behind bars without resorting to killing them.   worldwide have abolished the death penalty. Italy abolished the death penalty in 1948;  . In the Netherlands, the last execution took place in 1952; Australia in 1967. Since ending the death penalty in 1976,  . The U.S. is the   to conduct executions. Even Russia stopped executions in 1996. Our country   with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt and Pakistan. We are very late in ending state-sponsored executions. It can be done; last month  . Brandon, with his typical positivity, would say now is the time. Friends sitting on death row for years have taught me many lessons: patience, keeping the conversation real and meaningful, and appreciating what I have.  The hassle of driving my daughter to school is now about holding her hand at stoplights and rolling the windows down so I can feel the air. The freedom. During our daily talks, I never had anything to offer Brandon other than my love and support. He never asked me for a single thing besides friendship. Brandon was religious, but since I’m not, I couldn’t offer him prayers or talk about how heaven is a better place. I could only helplessly listen and tell him that I love him.    were his deep regret to the victims’ families, his love for his own family and, true to his thoughtful nature, he told the prison guards not to let his execution upset them. Our final words to each other were about what he would visualize on the gurney to stay calm. I told him to imagine my arms holding him down instead of straps and he promised he would. I was crying and told him I was sorry I couldn’t save him. He said I saved him with my love. And we said goodbye.",

   "text":"The progress of YSR free agricultural crop insurance scheme is slow in the district as farmers have to directly do the fingerprint for their registration and there are system problems too. Every year, most crops are damaged by climate imbalance and farmers facing severe losses. Crop insurance can support farmers in such situations. The state government launched the scheme last year. However, at the field level, officials are seeking the fingerprints of the growers to link them to the relevant website through the internet. Hence, the delay.   The state government has allowed the district to implement the scheme for 13 types of agricultural and horticultural crops during the kharif season last year. Agricultural extension officers, village agricultural and horticultural assistants and multi-purpose extension officers working at the Rythu Bharosa Kendram (RBK) have already registered their e-crop and got themselves connected to the Internet and uploaded information to the relevant mobile application. The information fed to the site are the farmer's name, survey number, village, cultivated paddy, acreage, whether the land is dry or wet. The E-crop registration was already completed for the 2020 Kharif season.   Recently, officials sought fingerprints of the respective farmers. As the process begins in all districts across the state, the pressure on the server increases and it slows down. This makes the process time-consuming. However, to overcome this problem, the farmers are divided into three groups. In Kadapa district, it has been decided to work on any two days of the week and Sunday. The district needs to link fingerprints from 1,28,582 farmers, but so far only 65,713 farmers have been able to give their fingerprints. More than 62,000 farmers would need to have their fingerprints linked to the net. Officials are trying to complete the work by April 15. Apart from the server problems, the biometric machines are malfunctioning. To catch up with time, the field staff is working even on holidays to feed information to the net.   In order to get insurance, the crop has to be registered first. Farmer fingerprints have also been made mandatory.",

   "article_summary":"International law does not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres in the EEZ without the consent of the concerned coastal state",
   "text":"The US Navy carried out a “freedom of navigation” operation in India’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near Lakshadweep Islands earlier this week, without New Delhi’s prior consent, to challenge what the US said were India’s “excessive” maritime claims, a official US statement said. The operation was conducted by guided missile destroyer   on Wednesday, April 7, a statement by the commander of the US Seventh Fleet said.   The US Navy said it had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone without requesting India’s prior consent”, saying further it had “challenged India’s excessive maritime claims”. The US Seventh Fleet claimed this operation was “consistent with international law”. Reacting to this on Friday evening, India said it had raised its concerns with the US through diplomatic channels, adding that the US warship’s movements had been continuously monitored. New Delhi made it clear that international law did not permit a nation to carry out military manoeuvres, especially involving weapons, in the EEZ and continental shelf without the consent of the concerned coastal state.   The US announcement is being seen by observers as nothing short of a mystifying attempt to humiliate India, which is a strategic partner of the US in the four-nation “Quad” that supports freedom of navigation in international waters. There is also speculation that it may be part of an American attempt to placate China at India’s expense. The Americans have been operating their warships in the South China Sea as well, which has angered Beijing in the recent past. In a statement, the MEA said: “The Government of India’s stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state.”   The MEA added: “The   was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the Government of the United States through diplomatic channels.” In its statement, meanwhile, the US Seventh Fleet said: “  (DDG 53) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law. India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”   It added: “US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows. We conduct routine and regular Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.” It is not the first time that the US Navy has conducted such an operation in India’s EEZ. The US defence department publishes an annual Freedom of Navigation Report “identifying the excessive maritime claims that US forces operationally challenged”. The last time the US Navy conducted such an operation was 2019. In an unclassified report to the US Congress in July 2020, the US Navy said it conducted an operation in the Indian Ocean region during the period from October 1, 2018, through September 30, 2019, to preserve the rights, freedoms, and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations by international law.  ",

   "article_summary":"If the CBMs ties improve further, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may pay a visit to Islamabad for the Saarc summit there later this year",
   "text":"The Indian government on Thursday sidestepped media queries on some claims in the Pakistani media that back-channel secret talks had begun between the two countries over a year ago, with New Delhi saying both countries had “functioning high commissions” in each other’s capitals that are a “very effective channel of communication”. The Pakistani media reports had further claimed that if the confidence-building measures (CBMs) hold and ties improve further, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may pay a visit to Islamabad for the Saarc summit there later this year. The developments come in the wake of a sudden perceptible improvement in India-Pakistan ties in the past six weeks following the implementation of the ceasefire at the Line of Control by the armies of the two countries.   “Our respective high commissions exist and are functioning. So that’s a very effective channel of communication”, MEA spokesman Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday, in response to reporters’ queries on the back-channel talks. When asked whether there could be any Saarc summit in Islamabad which could be attended by Prime Minister Modi, as claimed in Pakistani media reports, the MEA spokesman termed it as “speculation”, adding that he did not have anything to share on this for now. Just last week, in a “swift U-turn” on Thursday following a “political backlash”, the Pakistan government had “deferred” its move to import cotton and sugar from India and linked it to the condition that India should first restore Article 370 on Jammu and Kashmir that was abrogated two years ago. However, some optimistic Pakistani media reports are referring to this as a “temporary bump”.    ",

   "text":" The CRPF’s CoBRA commando Rakeshwar Singh Manhas walked free  on Thursday evening after spending five days in Maoists' custody. The jawan of 210 CoBRA battalion who was abducted by Maoists after the April 3 Naxal ambush on security forces in Terram on Sukma-Bijapur border in Chhattisgarh’s south Bastar region was handed over to a four-member emissary team, constituted by the Chhattisgarh government to negotiate his release, at an undisclosed location.   The jawan, with his hands tied, was produced before a \"jan adalat\" or kangaroo court of Maoists in the presence of scores of armed rebels, local villagers and mediapersons before being set free at 4 pm.   “The jawan has been released by Maoists. He has reached Basaguda camp (of CRPF),” Bijapur district superintendent of police Kamal Lochan Kashyap said. He was scheduled to be flown to Raipur after his medical checkup, police said. “As soon as we learnt that the jawan was held hostage by Maoists, we contacted eminent people in the region, social activists and mediapersons to secure his release from Maoist custody,” Mr Kashyap said.   Earlier in the morning, the four-member interlocutor team headed by Padma Shri Dharam Pal Jain left for an undisclosed location in the forest on Sukma-Bijapur border to negotiate the release of the jawan with the Maoists. “I was contacted by the government to become an interlocutor to negotiate release of the jawan. I left for the appointed place in the morning along with other members of the team and some media persons to secure release of the jawan. I am happy that Naxals kept their promise to release the jawan if approached by government-appointed emissaries,” Mr Jain said. The other members of the emissary team were local tribal community leader Telam Boraiya, retired teacher Rudra Kere and sarpanch of Surkunda panchayat in Bijapur district, Rukmni Ekka.   With relief writ large on his face, the jawan after his release told reporters, “They (Naxals) treated me well when I was in their custody”. As soon as he was handed over to the emissaries Mr Manhas contacted his family members in Jammu through the cell phone of a journalist present and informed them that he had been set free and was coming home very soon, a journalist who accompanied the delegation told this newspaper from the spot. Sources disclosed to this newspaper that the jawan was spotted by local villagers after the April 3 encounter who handed him to the Maoists. “Maoists had grilled him to extract information on the strength of the security forces deployed in the region and the kinds of weapons they use,” sources said.   Maoist guerillas led by commander of PLGA’s battalion number one Madvi Hidma ambushed a search party of security personnel in Terram area on April 3 killing 22 jawans and injuring 31 others.",

Whether it is agriculture, space, defense, aviation, or labor. In every sector necessary changes are being made for growth,” Modi said. Addressing the centenary convocation of the University of Mysore through video conferencing, he said it is being done for the sake of crores of youth in this country and to make this decade India’s. “This decade can be India’s only when we make our foundations strong. This decade has brought the immense opportunity for the youth,” he added. Modi greeted the people of the state on the occasion of “Nada Habba” (state festival) Dasara. Expressing sympathy towards those affected by floods in several parts of the state, the Prime Minister said the central and the Karnataka governments together were doing every bit to provide relief to all those affected.

   "text":"Women on social media are familiar with the scenario above. In most cases, we tend to brush off such attempts to breach our online privacy, because these things seem relatively harmless compared to the more pressing issues when it comes to women, such as the recent spike in gender-based violence. However, are such acts really that harmless? Women are harassed online in many ways, and unsolicited texts are just the tip of the iceberg, along with friend requests from unknown people. You must have come across revolting comments under pictures of female celebrities or of any woman that goes viral, most of which can be classified under hate speech. You most probably have heard stories of leaked private pictures, videos or information without consent – also known as doxxing – and the devastating toll it takes on the victims. \"I have been harassed online by men on many counts. Often, they were in the form of continuous pestering texts that start off nice, but get more degrading with time. Sometimes, their texts are accompanied by inappropriate pictures or videos,\" shares Fabiha Fairooz*, a freelance writer. \"Once, when I was in high school, a group of boys decided to bully my friends and I in a group chat,\" says Zareen Tasnim*, who is now completing her undergraduate degree abroad. \"They made very weak yet unacceptable attempts at insulting me, which had to do with my financial status, my dual nationality, my looks etc. They were even petty enough to make comments about me sending memes in that group chat.\" This is a serious problem which has only increased during the pandemic since we are forced to spend more time online than ever before. According to a recent report by  , 80 percent of the victims of cyberbullying in Bangladesh are adolescent girls and women in their early twenties. In another report by  , most victims of cyberbullying do not report to the police, hence the statistic does not take into account the cybercrimes that go unreported. The question arises, why don't people report cybercrimes? Anika Anjum Iftee, Head of Content Development and Marketing at WeMen View, a non-profit social welfare organisation which works to raise awareness against cyber harassment of women, thinks that such cases are generally taken less seriously than physical ones. \"It's because there are too many factors to consider. With the ongoing calling out culture, the conversation around things like unsolicited texts could be easily manipulated, which can make the main discourse rather confusing. Also, since how we behave on social media is an evolving process, there is still so much to define and to make laws on concretely. While all of that happens, a lot of us will be unfortunate enough to fall victim to online harassment.\" The fact that technology is evolving too fast for us to catch up on the expanding confines of online harassment rings very true. Almost every day, new strides are being made in technology with more opportunities for harassers to abuse them. In this dizzying mess, no wonder tech-savvy women are struggling to deal with a constant barrage of harassment, both big and small. \"I don't think there's much to do. In my experience of receiving unwanted texts, I find that confronting these men is very draining because most see no wrong in their actions and will continue to verbally abuse you or others,\" Fabiha adds. It is as clear as daylight that the toxic standards most men in this region have been brought up to contribute to their interactions online. The firm belief that they will get away with harassing women in both physical and virtual spaces unfortunately enables them to do so. In addition, the common yet unjust shaming of female victims further encourages these abusers to carry on, as Zareen and her friends had faced, \"This cyberbullying incident was reported to the school management, but they didn't fulfil their promises. Instead, they resorted to victim blaming by accusing us of isolating one of our classmates who egged those boys on, even though we weren't friends with her in the first place.\" For all kinds of abuse, for too long, women have been putting in all the work to rage against the injustice. In the case of cyber harassment, from tightening privacy settings to filing cases, women still carry the burden to take preventive measures. However, prevention is not the only cure, at least in this case. In order to see an end to harassment not limited to the digital realm, education comes first, as Anjum explains, \"Measures should be integrated into the way we socialise from an early stage. At WeMen View, we want to teach children how to respect other genders and expand to do workshops with parents too. Humility and kindness are very important in the process of learning how to behave. Children need to know about the obvious red flags because if we are not aware of the danger, we won't be ready to tackle it.\" In the end, it all comes down to getting acquainted with some very simple, basic concepts: consent and respecting one's personal space, and that these apply to everyone regardless of any parameter that you can think of. If we keep all these in mind, perhaps one day all the spheres we occupy, the virtual one included, can be safe for everyone. * \n 1. The Daily Star (December 10, 2020).  2.

   "text":"\r\nIndia has become the fastest country to administer 100 million coronavirus vaccine doses as per numbers with India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. To administer 100 million COVID vaccine doses, India took just 85 days. This is a major feat as the US and China took 89 and 102 days respectively to reach the 100 million mark. The development is sure to give a further boost to India's fight against the coronavirus pandemic even as a spike in number of infections has been seen in recent days. A country of more than a billion people, India faces a big task as it vaccinates its population. Frontline workers, citizens aged 60 and above as well as those aged 45 years and above (with comorbidities) have been given preference in the initial stages of India's coronavirus vaccination drive. The need for redoubled efforts in the fight against the pandemic was felt on Saturday as more than 100 thousand new coronavirus cases were reported across India. The death toll was up too. As per the health ministry data, death toll rose by 794 to a total of 168,436. Most cases have been detected in the western state of Maharashtra. The state has already shut down restaurants, malls and places of worship and barred the movement of most people to control the outbreak that has threatened to overrun medical facilities and created vaccine shortages. The weekend lockdown will end on Monday.",

   "text":"The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNCHR) urged Guinea on Saturday to \"speed up\" the trial for those responsible for a massacre on more than 150 opposition supporters exactly 10 years ago. More than 100 women were also raped by troops during a massive opposition protest in a stadium in the capital Conakry on September 28, 2009, against then junta chief Moussa Dadis Camara whose security forces opened fire on the crowd. \"Impunity has prevailed for too long in Guinea and is preventing victims’ scars from healing,\" the U.N.'s Michelle Bachelet said in a statement. \"Sustainable peace and reconciliation will not be achieved until justice and accountability is upheld,\" she added. Guinean judges completed the investigation into the massacre in 2017 but a trial date has still not been set. On Friday, Guinea Prime Minister Ibrahima Kassory Fofana said the government was \"determined\" to organise a trial of the alleged perpetrators of the killings \"to deliver justice to the victims\".  A U.N. Commission of Inquiry established in 2009 concluded that there was a \"strong presumption that crimes against humanity were committed\". The U.N. said 156 people were killed, at least 109 girls and women were victims of sexual violence, corpses were buried in mass graves, demonstrators were tortured and authorities \"modified\" crime scenes. Bachelet said despite the investigation recommending Guinean authorities prosecute those responsible and compensate victims almost a decade ago, there had been \"little tangible progress so far\".  \"It is particularly worrying that a number of high-ranking indicted officials are still serving and have not yet been brought to justice,\" she said, urging the authorities to \"speed up the organisation of the trial\". Camara, a former army officer, seized power in 2008 after the death of Guinea's longtime dictator Lansana Conte. After surviving an assassination attempt in 2009, Camara fled the to exile in Burkina Faso, where he was indicted in July 2015 by Guinean magistrates for his alleged involvement in the massacre. President Alpha Conde became Guinea's first democratically elected president in 2010, taking over a nation run by a succession of strongmen following independence from France.",

Moroccan authorities say they have stopped 57,000 migrants from illegally crossing to Spain between January 1 and September 1.

   "text":"SINGAPORE: HomeTeamNS launched its newest five-storey clubhouse in Khatib on Saturday (Apr 10). Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry. Through backend integration, we are able to analyse the data gathered to better understand their preferences and thereafter improve the way we engage them.” The clubhouse was in the news last year after three COVID-19 cases visited Jewel Music Box KTV lounge, a tenant of the clubhouse, on Aug 1, 2020 and Aug 2, 2020. Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.",

   "article_summary":"SINGAPORE: In a surprise announcement on Thursday (Apr 8), Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Heng Swee Keat   as successor to the current Prime Minister (PM) Lee Hsien Loong.",
   "text":"SINGAPORE: In a surprise announcement on Thursday (Apr 8), Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Heng Swee Keat   as successor to the current Prime Minister (PM) Lee Hsien Loong. By stating he would no longer be head of the fourth-generation (4G) team of leaders in Government, Mr Heng has thrown the question of who will succeed PM Lee wide open yet again. Mr Heng, a career civil servant until he contested in the 2011 General Election (GE), had been chosen as the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) First Assistant Secretary-General in November 2018. In April 2019, he was appointed Singapore’s sole DPM, signifying that there had been a consensus among the 4G team that Mr Heng should lead them and the country. With these developments, Mr Heng, was in all senses, the PM-designate. He was even handed the task of Acting PM in the absence of PM Lee. When he brought his East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) to a slim victory after an 11th hour switch from his stronghold in Tampines GRC in GE2020, some were generous to say that he successfully held off a rout by the Workers’ Party. A second camp argued he had been wounded by his performance and wondered if the party might review his suitability as the nation’s next leader. They might think their instinct was right when Mr Heng said he was stepping aside for a new leader but he has also debunked this perceived link: “The results in the GE2020 performance, in particular, in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside,” he said at the media conference on Thursday. In response to DPM Heng’s announcement, the 4G leaders said in a statement on Thursday “this unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning”. Given that PM Lee also said he would be announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks’ time, the question arises: Why was it not possible to pair the announcements to give the assurance to citizens that there would be, nonetheless, forward momentum in the process of leadership renewal? Since PM Lee said there would be consequential shifts, would those whose political stocks rise – a second DPM, a new Minister for Finance or even a new Defence Minister, for instance, give indication of who the PAP might test as a replacement for Mr Heng. But whose choice would that be? While the two-week interregnum may cause the rumour mills to go into overdrive, can the matter of who the 4G leaders wish to select be settled quite so quickly? Should it? Having said that, if current Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is also Second Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP, were to be placed in the powerful Finance Minister role, it could be taken as a forgone conclusion that Mr Chan is next in line to succeed PM Lee. This would be the fastest way to resolve the succession question. Like Mr Heng, Mr Chan entered Government with the 2011 GE. He has held a few full ministerial portfolios but most unusually, has had a tour of duty outside of mainstream government as the country’s labour chief - Secretary-General at the National Trades Union Congress. He has also been developing his international exposure through a collaborative project between the Government and that of Chongqing province in the People’s Republic of China. His previous incarnation as a Major-General and Chief of Army in the Singapore Armed Forces will have afforded him defence networks in the region and also in the United States where he was the first foreign graduate to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award by the prestigious Army Command and General Staff College. In his current portfolio as Industry and Trade Minister during the pandemic, Minister Chan has worked overtime to secure multilateral trade arrangements and ensure that international trade lines remain open. However, at Thursday’s press conference on Mr Heng’s announcement, Mr Chan and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung - another 4G member touted to be a contender for the premiership - said that the 4G team will need time to consider afresh and “holistically” who might be most suited to be the “captain of the team” using Ong’s preferred metaphor.  In other words, the most obvious choice may not be the answer. What is at stake here? The deleterious public health and economic effects of COVID-19, Mr Heng, explained, would require several years to recede.  PM Lee has also previously acknowledged this while assuring Singaporeans that he will see Singapore through the current crisis and is “determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team”. If he only took over as premier then, Mr Heng would already be in his mid-60s. Sixty-five, we know, is the age when Singapore’s first PM Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to stand down and also two years older than when its second PM, Goh Chok Tong, transferred premiership to the current PM.  This would not have given Mr Heng a long enough runway to govern before the handover to the next leader is expected. This cycle of leadership succession would have started again all too soon. Precious time has been lost to the pandemic since the PM-in-waiting was also limited in his ability to travel overseas to strengthen his standing in the international community. From the disruptions that emanate from US-China relations and the domestic political instability within some of our Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncertainty about how ASEAN can continue to provide ballast for peace, stability and security in the region, which Singapore relies on, is something PM Lee’s successor must be prepared to address.  This person must have a certain level of exposure and experience in operating on that plane. In that regard, the two former Principal Private Secretaries to the current PM, Mr Ong and Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who are on the other hand 51 and 48 years old respectively, may also have some help to draw upon.  They can ride on the networks they have built from that role as well as the tutelage of the current PM - much like Mr Heng could, given that he played the same role to Singapore’s first PM. The advantage might go to Mr Wong, who has built a high and favourable public profile as co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 and clearly has the confidence of DPM Heng, serving as the latter’s Second Minister of Finance since August 2016. If on the other hand, the 4G privileges a leader’s standing domestically and more importantly, his or her ability to motivate to inspire peers and citizens, the people-oriented Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at 44 years of age may be given more time to prove himself. Ironically, this process of readying these individuals and testing the dynamics among the 4G leaders without Mr Heng in the picture will indeed take time. The next PAP Conference and GE may even be needed as barometers of support among cadres and citizens. With PM Lee to provide the firm and steady leadership through the severe and immediate COVID-19 challenge, the best way forward is to take a step back to watch how these candidates continue to interact with Singaporeans, their international counterparts and each other before a new successor is announced.",

   "text":": FC Goa need to go in with a \"winning mentality\" and adopt a \"meticulous\" approach as it makes its debut in the AFC Champions League Group Stage to be held for the first time in India, said former India captain Bruno Coutinho. ISL champions FC Goa will become the first club from the country to play in the continental club competition on 14 April when they take on Qatar's Al-Rayyan. FC Goa will compete alongside Persepolis, Al-Rayyan and Al-Wahda in Group E of the group stages. \"The clubs that are coming here have been playing at this high level from prior. For them this is not the first time in the competition,\" Bruno said in a release issued by AIFF. \"They have very good players and it is not easy playing against teams from West Asian countries. In contrast, we are the debutants. So we need to be meticulous. \"There is nothing to fear. You have to go with a winning mentality, which is most important.\" The action in Group E will kick off with Iran's Persepolis taking on Al-Wahda of the UAE in the opening encounter, followed by hosts FC Goa crossing swords against Qatari side Al-Rayyan. \"It is the biggest opportunity for fans and the Indian football fraternity that the AFC Champions League is being held in Goa. It is an honour for the players and for me as well, as a Goan,\" Bruno, an Arjuna Awardee said. \"The tournament coming to India for the first time and an Indian team — FC Goa — playing for the first time — is great. I would like to wish good luck to them. All the best and go for the kill!\" he added. Bruno, who represented India in 44 matches and has also been a recipient of the AIFF Player of the Year Award in 1996, said \"the experience will help them mature faster.\" \"I consider them lucky as they are getting to play at this level. Such moments call for giving 200 percent on the pitch.\"",

   "article_summary":"The court refused to order the release of nearly 150 Rohingyas detained in holding centres in Jammu",
   "text":" The Supreme Court on Thursday permitted the deportation of Rohingya refugees detained at Jammu. Passing the order on the PIL moved by Mohammad Salimullah for the protection of Rohingyas, the court refused to order the release of nearly 150 Rohingyas detained in holding centres in Jammu and allowed their deportation to their parent country as per procedure of law. “It is not possible to grant interim relief. However, it is made clear that the Rohingyas in Jammu on whose behalf the application has been moved shall not be deported unless the procedure prescribed for such deportation is followed,\" ruled a bench headed by Chief Justice Sharad  A. Bobde, also comprising Justice A.S. Bopanna and Justice V. Ramasubramanian.   During the hearing on March 23, lawyer Prashant Bhushan had pleaded that sending the Rohingyas to Myanmar when it is under a military junta will endanger their life, noting that the principle of non-refoulement forbids expulsion of a refugee if there is a clear and certain danger to life in the original country. \r\nHe also referred to the order passed by the International Court of Justice to highlight that Rohingyas faced genocidal threat there. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta appearing for the Centre had opposed the application on behalf of Rohingya refugees seeking to stall their deportation. He had cited a similar application concerning the Rohingyas in Assam that was dismissed in 2018. \r\n    Mr Mehta had submitted that the deportation is done in accordance with the procedure established by law, and hence it cannot be held to be violative of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. The Centre also disputed that Rohingya detainees were refugees and called them \"illegal migrants\". \r\n\"India cannot be a capital for all illegal migrants of the world\", the SG said. During the hearing, the CJI made oral observations acknowledging the threat faced by Rohingyas in Myanmar but added that the court cannot do anything about it.",

   "article_summary":"If the CBMs ties improve further, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may pay a visit to Islamabad for the Saarc summit there later this year",
   "text":"The Indian government on Thursday sidestepped media queries on some claims in the Pakistani media that back-channel secret talks had begun between the two countries over a year ago, with New Delhi saying both countries had “functioning high commissions” in each other’s capitals that are a “very effective channel of communication”. The Pakistani media reports had further claimed that if the confidence-building measures (CBMs) hold and ties improve further, Prime Minister Narendra Modi may pay a visit to Islamabad for the Saarc summit there later this year. The developments come in the wake of a sudden perceptible improvement in India-Pakistan ties in the past six weeks following the implementation of the ceasefire at the Line of Control by the armies of the two countries.   “Our respective high commissions exist and are functioning. So that’s a very effective channel of communication”, MEA spokesman Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday, in response to reporters’ queries on the back-channel talks. When asked whether there could be any Saarc summit in Islamabad which could be attended by Prime Minister Modi, as claimed in Pakistani media reports, the MEA spokesman termed it as “speculation”, adding that he did not have anything to share on this for now. Just last week, in a “swift U-turn” on Thursday following a “political backlash”, the Pakistan government had “deferred” its move to import cotton and sugar from India and linked it to the condition that India should first restore Article 370 on Jammu and Kashmir that was abrogated two years ago. However, some optimistic Pakistani media reports are referring to this as a “temporary bump”.    ",

   "article_summary":"The government has to further address the long-pending demand of ad hoc assistant professors working in universities since long",
   "text":"Andhra Pradesh government has decided to fill up all vacant posts of faculty members in each of 17 universities in about two to four months. The decision comes in the wake of an order issued by the AP High Court. \r\nFollowing the order, the state government has directed all its universities to take up rationalisation of teaching posts, including assistant professors, associate professors and professors, for arriving at the number of vacancies university-wise.   Simultaneously, it has taken up the exercise for filling jobs as per reservations provided for BC, SC, ST and other categories. AP higher education authorities maintain that all vacancies in each university will be filled in about two to four months. They say a series of anomalies had risen in filling up of posts in the recruitment drive taken up by the previous Telugu Desam regime. They will have to thus start the entire process all over again. The previously conducted screening test by Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) stands cancelled. This means those who qualified for that test will have to take the screening test again. Though the state government proposed to consider the candidature of the previously qualified candidates, the High Court did not permit the government to do so.   Moreover, the University Grants Commission had earlier issued a direction stating that a PhD degree will be a mandatory qualification for direct recruitment to the post of assistant professor in universities with effect from 01-07-2021. The state government will have to look into this issue too while taking up fresh recruitment of assistant professors. The government has to further address the long-pending demand of ad hoc assistant professors working in universities since long. They have to be fixed into a time scale before going in for fresh recruitment drive as, otherwise, they could take to legal course, which would again stall the entire recruitment process.   AP Higher Education Council chairman K. Hemachandra Reddy said, “Following a recent order of High Court, the state government will take a fresh recruitment drive for all teaching positions in each of the 17 universities in AP in two to four months from now. There will be a fresh screening test for recruitment of assistant professors. We have to take care of some other issues too before going in for the recruitment drive to avoid further hurdles,” he underlined.",

   "text":"Thousands of pilgrims from Karnataka were stranded at Srisailam bus station on Thursday as buses were not plying from Karnataka due to a KSRTC strike. For the first time, the ghat road was open for buses to reach Srisailam after 9pm. Forest officials close the road after 9pm till 5am to avoid late-night driving, for the past several years.   The pilgrims who reached Srisailam from different parts of Karnataka on foot, covering hundreds of km, had their Darshan in the past two days. Now, when they want to return home, no bus service was available as KSRTC staff went on a strike since Wednesday.  Pilgrims have come to Srisailam from 13 districts in Karnataka, like Bijapur, Haveri, Bellari, Gulbarga, Raichur, Bidar, Hubbali, Bangalore, and Tumkur. Kurnool APSRTC regional manager  T Venkata Ramam said about 20 buses were sent on Thursday to Srisailam. There was some problem till afternoon and it was cleared thereafter, he said.   As the ZPTC and MPTC elections are also held on Thursday, we have dispatched 150 buses since Wednesday evening. Once they return on Thursday, they will be pressed into service, he said. “The passengers are brought up to Kurnool and from here they go to their respective destinations taking link services,” he said. A temple official said normally these pilgrims will wait till the Rathotsavam on April 13, Ugadi day. This year, maybe due to the corona scare, they were rushing to go back to their homes after the darshan. Buses from Achampet in Nagarkurnool district were also requisitioned to help the stranded pilgrims, said temple executive officer Rama Rao.  ",

   "text":": With just six days left for the byelection to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat, political parties have started challenging each other on one issue or another to keep up the poll tempo. The latest is panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy’s offer to opposition Telugu Desam to treat the byelection as a referendum. “Our 21 members of parliament will put in their papers if YSRC loses Tirupati LS by-poll. Are your MPs ready to resign if we win the election,” the minister questioned TD.   Reacting to opposition leader Nara Chandrababu Naidu’s remark on YSR Congress failing to get Special Category Status for AP from the Centre, Ramachandra Reddy retorted whether that TD MPs had done so when their party was in power. Speaking to media persons in Tirupati on Sunday, the minister said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has put off his election campaign in Tirupati in view of a sharp increase in number of Coronavirus positive cases in Chittoor district. He expressed confidence that YSR Congress will win the byelection on the basis of welfare programmes introduced by the Chief Minister for downtrodden within the state.   “Benefits of these programmes have even reached doorsteps of beneficiaries in the state,” Ramachandra Reddy pointed out. He underlined that thousands of crores have been earmarked for completion of irrigation projects in Rayalaseema on a war footing.",

   "article_summary":"In his speech, the former president reiterated his allegation that there was massive electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential elections",
   "text":" In his first public speech since leaving office, former US president Donald Trump has called for Republican Party unity while indicating that he might launch a third presidential bid in 2024 even as he slammed the Biden administration, claiming that the country has gone from America First to America Last\" in just one month. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Committee in Orlando, Florida on Sunday, the 74-year-old leader, who left the White House on January 20, stopped short of announcing to run for the president in 2024, although he gave enough indications that he is moving in that direction.   \"We will take back the House. We will win the Senate and then a Republican president would triumph the White House. I wonder, who that will be,\" he said amidst cheers from his supporters at the annual session of the committee. Trump, however, ruled out forming a new party, arguing that such a move will split votes of conservatives, and called on his supporters to unite for defeating the ruling democrats in the 2022 mid-term polls. Several Republican leaders, including his top critic Senator Mitt Romney, have said that they will support Trump in his presidential bid, if he wins the 2024 Republican party primary.   Romney has said that Trump will win the party's primary, if he decides to run for president again. Opinion polls have shown that Trump, who is the first US president to have been impeached twice, is highly popular among Republican party members and supporters, and way ahead of others. In a bid to galvanise his base, Trump, during his 90-minute speech, repeatedly attacked the Democrats and President Joe Biden. \"We will persist and we will prevail. We are tougher than they (Democrats) are. We are stronger than they are. Together in the coming years, we will carry forward the torch of American liberty,\" he said, alleging that the policies of the Biden administration were taking the country on the path of socialism and vowed to not let the country move in that direction.   Tearing into the 40-day rule of the Biden administration, Trump also said that it was \"anti-jobs, anti-family, anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women and anti-science\". \"We all knew that the Biden administration was going to be bad, but none of us even imagined just how bad it would be and how far Left they would go. \"In just one short month, we have gone from 'America First' to America Last',\" Trump said. Listing out some of the key achievements of his administration, Trump asserted that he handed Biden's new administration a modern-day medical miracle in terms of vaccines for COVID-19.   I pushed the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) like they have never been pushed before. They have never been pushed like I pushed them. I didn't like them at all, but once we got it done, I said I now love you very much', he said. He also accused Biden of opening up borders for illegal immigrants. \"Trumpism means strong borders. It means law enforcement, very strong protection for the Second Amendment, support for the forgotten men and women who have been taken advantage of for so many years,\" Trump said. In his speech, the former president reiterated his allegation that there was massive electoral fraud in the November 2020 presidential elections and asserted that he had actually won it.   However, poll officials and Congress have certified that the election's results were in favour of Biden. Trump's allegations of electoral malpractice have been thrown out by various US courts, including the Supreme Court.",

   "text":"SINGAPORE: Singaporean businesses, like other enterprises in Myanmar, have been trying to navigate the turbulent waves created by the military coup on Feb 1. Their operations have been affected in three main ways: Everyday disruptions brought about by political protests against the coup, challenges raised by the measures taken by the military government to assert control over resistance to the coup, and greater scrutiny of Singaporean businesses and their links with the Myanmar military. In the first few days after the coup, internet blackouts and communication blocks set up by the military government created communication challenges between Singapore headquarters and their in-country staff. The military government has since ordered several temporary internet shutdowns. At present, access to the internet is heavily blocked — it is shut down between 1 am and 9 am, and mobile internet and pocket Wi-Fi have been cut. Only broadband Wi-Fi is working. Besides restricting communication, this has made it difficult for news and information to be disseminated, an invaluable resource at a time of uncertainty and rapid change. In February, the military government adopted a 2021 Electronic Transactions Law Amendment that increases the criminalization of data use and sharing, and creates problematic data protection rules. These changes came a few days after a draft Cyber Security bill was proposed by the military government to give it the power to block websites, order internet shutdowns, and restrict the dissemination of what it considers false news. In addition, Singaporean businesses are in facing disruptions in workflow and cashflow. Many shops, factories and banks have been closed due to the political protests.  At the same time, the participation of civil servants in the civil disobedience movement has slowed down the processing of permits, licences and other bureaucratic procedures. Banks remain closed due to political protests on the part of bank employees. As a result, carrying out financial transactions has become a challenge for all businesses in Myanmar.  Businesses and individuals alike are unable to use over-the-counter services such as banking in or cashing cheques and withdrawing or transferring large amounts of money. Although it is still possible to withdraw cash from ATMs and transfer money online, the limits on these amounts make it challenging to pay for higher value items such as rent, supplies, start-up costs and so on. To compound matters, Singaporean businesses have come under increased scrutiny by international and Myanmar activists. As Singapore has been the largest foreign investor in Myanmar since 2012, having invested more than US$24 billion (S$32.2 billion) between 1988 and January 2021, activists are calling on the public to pressure Singapore companies to cut ties with the Myanmar military and its associated businesses so as to undermine the regime’s political legitimacy. In Myanmar, the nature of links between businesses and the military is wide-ranging in scope. They include, among other things, the leasing of land, the sale and purchase of goods and services, joint ventures, and stakes in the two military conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and their subsidiaries. These conglomerates, owned and influenced by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, own more than 100 businesses across many sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, construction, gem extraction, tourism and banking. The revenue from these businesses strengthens the military’s autonomy from former elected civilian oversight and provides financial support for its operations. Among those Singaporean companies that have been singled out is Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC). Golden City, the company’s residential and commercial project was to be built on land reportedly leased from the military. ETC suspended trading of its shares on the Singapore Exchange after the latter launched an official query. It has also reportedly engaged an independent professional to review some of its dealings in Myanmar. TRD, which supplies anti-drone guns, has reportedly stopped doing business in Myanmar after it became known that the Myanmar police were using these devices against protestors. It has also been reported that Coda, a Singapore-headquartered digital payments company, has removed military-affiliated telecoms firm Mytel from its portfolio. Razer’s co-founder and director declared that he would sell his one-third stake in a joint venture that owns RMH Singapore, which in turn owns 49 per cent of Myanmar’s cigarette maker Virginia Tobacco Company. The rest of Virginia Tobacco is owned by MEHL. It is likely that other Singaporean businesses will divest their holdings to cut their links with the military’s conglomerates and or to seek profits in other countries in the region. Surprisingly though, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has received enquiries from Singapore enterprises that are keen to explore future business opportunities in Myanmar. Despite the turmoil and upheaval of the coup, it appears that Singaporean businesses are determined to ride out the storm. According to the SBF, many Singaporean enterprises in Myanmar are keenly aware of the risks and challenges of operating in an emerging economy. They have been mentally prepared for political upheaval. Those Singaporean businesses that remain in Myanmar are keeping their heads down and paddling hard to keep afloat. Their goal is to reap long-term gains and their ability to survive will depend on their tenacity, adaptability and ties with their Myanmar community.",

   "text":"Oscar-winning filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho has spoken out against the anti-Asian hate in the US, saying that attacks on the minority communities make him feel \"quite fearful\". The   director made the comments during an interview at Chapman University’s Dodge College in Orange, California, reported  . When asked about the incidents of racial discrimination and violence towards Asian people, Bong, who was speaking through a translator from his home in South Korea, said he has an outsider perspective on the issue. \"But as someone who is a part of mankind, as a person, it’s quite fearful to watch the hate crimes against Asian-Americans and the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement,\" he said. Bong said directors and creators should be bolder when dealing with current issues of society. \"I do think about what the film industry can do at this time. With films, creating a film takes a lot of time and a lot of money; it's a big unit that can’t really respond quickly to issues that are currently happening in society,\" he said. \"But ironically, because of that, I think creators and filmmakers can be bolder with dealing with issues and they shouldn’t be afraid to confront them,\" he added. Referring to filmmaker Spike Lee’s 1989 movie  , Bong said the film is a perfect example of how directors can address societal issues through their work. \"Not necessarily to predict what will happen in society, but to use your insight to portray the issues that are currently boiling underneath the surface of society that can explode later on,\" he added. The filmmaker said he tried to follow Lee's method with his 2019 social satire  , which became the first South Korean movie to win the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020. \"For me,   was a film where I tried to take that approach… (the film) talks about the haves and have-nots of our current society. It began with a question of ''what does it mean to be poor or rich in our current times?'' \"As creators and artists, you sort of have to see through the essence and the central questions in our society through the days that you live through and send a reply to those questions through your work,\" Bong said. The South Korean filmmaker's comments come weeks after six women of Asian descent were among eight people killed by a gunman in a series of shootings at massage parlours in Georgia, US.",

Zhao spent her entire victory speech praising her fellow nominees, who must now be wondering what they can do to catch up with her critically adored and awards-dominating US road movie before the Academy Awards on 25 April. \"I want to thank you guys for teaching me so much, and for showing your support -- you have made this journey so much more special,\" the 39-year-old director, previously best known for the indie movie  , told rival directors via video call.

   "article_summary":"The orders ranged from rejoining the Paris agreement, halting US' withdrawal from WHO, and stopping construction of Mexico border wall",
   "text":": On day one in office, US President Joe Biden has signed 15 executive orders, reversing some of the key foreign policies and national security decisions of his predecessor Donald Trump. The executive orders ranged from rejoining the Paris agreement on climate change, halting America's withdrawal from the World Health Organisation, revoking Muslim travel ban and stopping immediate construction of Mexico border wall.   \"I'm proud of today's executive actions, and I'm going to start by keeping the promises I made to the American people. A long way to go. These are just executive actions. They are important, but we're going to need legislation for a lot of the things we're going to do,\" Biden told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House as he signed the first lot of executive orders on Wednesday. The president said he will be signing a number of executive orders over the next several days of the week. \"And I'm going to start today on the compounding crisis of COVID, along with the economic crisis following that, and climate crisis, racial equity issues,\" he said.   His first executive order was launching his 100-day masking challenge, asking Americans to mask up for 100 days. Biden is doing his part as well, issuing a mask mandate that will require anyone visiting a federal building or federal land or using certain modes of public transportation to wear a mask, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Addressing her maiden news conference on Wednesday, Psaki said Biden has signed 15 executive orders and two other directives. The president signed an executive order reversing Trump's decision to withdraw from the World Health Organisation, she said.   \"This will strengthen our own efforts to get the (coronavirus) pandemic under control by improving global health, and tomorrow we are not wasting any time,\" she said. Biden also officially appointed a COVID-19 response coordinator, a position and team that he had already previously announced but made it official today to create a unified national response to the pandemic. He re-established the national security team responsible for global health, security and bio-defence. Noting that COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an almost unprecedented housing affordability crisis, Psaki said the president took immediate action to confront the crisis and asked relevant agencies to extend nationwide moratoriums on evictions and foreclosures.   The pandemic has also increased the hardships of millions of Americans who owe federal student loans. In response, the president asked the education department to extend the pause on student loan payments and interest, she said. \"He (Biden) rejoined the Paris climate agreement putting the United States back in a position to exercise global leadership in advancing the objectives of the ambitious agreement,\" Psaki said. In a second broad executive order, Biden rolled back harmful regulatory reversals made by the previous administration to protect public health and the environment.   This order protects nation's treasures by reviewing the boundaries for several national monuments, places a temporary moratorium on all oil and natural gas leasing in the Arctic national wildlife refuge and reestablishes the interagency working group on the social cost of greenhouse gases. \"He also launched a whole of government effort to advance racial equity and root out systemic racism from federal programs and institutions. He directed the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with the Attorney General to take all appropriate actions to preserve and fortify DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which provides temporary relief from deportation to dreamers, young people who were brought to this country as children,\" Psaki said.   \"The president also put an end to the Muslim ban, a policy rooted in religious animus and xenophobia. He sent a proclamation effective immediately halting further funding construction of the previous administration's border wall and terminating the so-called national emergency use to wastefully divert billions for wall construction,\" she said. Biden also sent an immigration bill (the US Citizenship Act of 2021) to Congress to modernise the immigration system, she said. Biden told reporters that these are just all starting points.   \"We are going to, in the process of rebuilding the economy, do what I said throughout the campaign and while running: rebuild the backbone of the country, the middle class. And so there's going to be a lot of focus on that. I think some of the things we're going to be doing are we're going to be are bold and vital, and there's no time to start like today,\" he said.",

   "text":"The United States will share the COVID-19 vaccine with the rest of the world if it has a surplus, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday. \"If we have a surplus, we are going to share it with the rest of the world. We have already decided we are going to work with the outfit COVAX. We've committed USD 4 billion to help get the funding for more vaccines around the world,\" he told reporters at the White House.   \"This is not something that can be stopped by a fence, no matter how high you build a fence or a wall. So we're not going to be ultimately safe until the world is safe,\" Biden said. \"So we are going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first but we are then going to try to help the rest of the world,\" Biden said in response to a question. Earlier, the president lauded the \"historic, nearly unprecedented collaboration\" between Johnson and Johnson and Merck as he underscored the move to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson and Johnson vaccine. The CEOs -- Alex Gorsky from Johnson and Johnson and Kenneth Frazier from Merck -- praised him and thanked him in their brief comments.   \"Today, we're seeing two health companies, competitors, each with over 130 years of experience coming together to help write a more hopeful chapter in our battle against COVID-19. I just had an opportunity to meet with both of these CEOs and with their senior operating officers. And to hear about the work they're doing together to produce a vaccine, substitute and accelerate what they call to take it to full finish,\" he said. It's not just Johnson and Johnson and Merck, Pfizer and Moderna also work closely with the administration to help speed up the delivery of millions more doses, he said.   \"The result is that we're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every American adult by the end of May. Months earlier than anyone expected. And today I'm directing Jeff and my HHS Team to produce another 100 million doses and purchase another 100 million dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine,\" he said. Biden said that on Thursday he would deliver a primetime address to the American people and talk about what the country has been through as a nation this past year. \"More importantly, I'm going to talk about what comes next. I am going to launch the next phase of the COVID response and explain what we will do as a government and what we will ask of the American people,\" he said.   \"There is a light at the end of this dark tunnel over the past year. We cannot let our guard down now or assume the victory is inevitable. Together, we are going to get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future,\" Biden said. In his brief remarks, Gorsky said that the American pharma industry realised in the early days of the pandemic that vaccine development -- it wasn't a race against each other as competitors. \"It's really a race against time to defeat a common enemy,\" he said. \"Today we're at war with COVID-19 and public-private partnerships like the historic one that we're celebrating today, well they're a major reason that last week I was privileged enough to witness some of the very first residents in our home state of New Jersey receiving doses of our vaccines just 13 months after we started the development process,\" Gorsky said.   Frazier said that COVID-19 pandemic has affected all areas of global community and added it has created profound challenges and hardships, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people and communities. \"It has also shone a light on the resilience of our first responders, scientists, healthcare workers, and those providing essential community services: the real heroes of this challenging moment,\" he said. \"At Merck, we are proud to contribute to the global response to the pandemic. Through this collaboration with our colleagues at Johnson and Johnson and the Biden administration, we will work together to enable more timely delivery of much needed medicines and vaccines for the pandemic,\" he said.  ",

   "article_summary":"Maoists had grilled him to extract information on the strength of the security forces deployed in the region and the weapons they use",
   "text":" The CRPF’s CoBRA commando Rakeshwar Singh Manhas walked free  on Thursday evening after spending five days in Maoists' custody. The jawan of 210 CoBRA battalion who was abducted by Maoists after the April 3 Naxal ambush on security forces in Terram on Sukma-Bijapur border in Chhattisgarh’s south Bastar region was handed over to a four-member emissary team, constituted by the Chhattisgarh government to negotiate his release, at an undisclosed location.   The jawan, with his hands tied, was produced before a \"jan adalat\" or kangaroo court of Maoists in the presence of scores of armed rebels, local villagers and mediapersons before being set free at 4 pm.   “The jawan has been released by Maoists. He has reached Basaguda camp (of CRPF),” Bijapur district superintendent of police Kamal Lochan Kashyap said. He was scheduled to be flown to Raipur after his medical checkup, police said. “As soon as we learnt that the jawan was held hostage by Maoists, we contacted eminent people in the region, social activists and mediapersons to secure his release from Maoist custody,” Mr Kashyap said.   Earlier in the morning, the four-member interlocutor team headed by Padma Shri Dharam Pal Jain left for an undisclosed location in the forest on Sukma-Bijapur border to negotiate the release of the jawan with the Maoists. “I was contacted by the government to become an interlocutor to negotiate release of the jawan. I left for the appointed place in the morning along with other members of the team and some media persons to secure release of the jawan. I am happy that Naxals kept their promise to release the jawan if approached by government-appointed emissaries,” Mr Jain said. The other members of the emissary team were local tribal community leader Telam Boraiya, retired teacher Rudra Kere and sarpanch of Surkunda panchayat in Bijapur district, Rukmni Ekka.   With relief writ large on his face, the jawan after his release told reporters, “They (Naxals) treated me well when I was in their custody”. As soon as he was handed over to the emissaries Mr Manhas contacted his family members in Jammu through the cell phone of a journalist present and informed them that he had been set free and was coming home very soon, a journalist who accompanied the delegation told this newspaper from the spot. Sources disclosed to this newspaper that the jawan was spotted by local villagers after the April 3 encounter who handed him to the Maoists. “Maoists had grilled him to extract information on the strength of the security forces deployed in the region and the kinds of weapons they use,” sources said.   Maoist guerillas led by commander of PLGA’s battalion number one Madvi Hidma ambushed a search party of security personnel in Terram area on April 3 killing 22 jawans and injuring 31 others.",

   "article_summary":"An initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause",
   "text":": A maritime traffic jam grew to more than 200 vessels Friday outside the Suez Canal and some vessels began changing course as dredgers worked frantically to free a giant container ship that is stuck sideways in the waterway and disrupting global shipping. One salvage expert said freeing the cargo ship, the Ever Given, could take up to a week in the best-case scenario and warned of possible structural problems on the vessel as it remains wedged.   The Ever Given, owned by the Japanese firm Shoei Kisen KK, got wedged Tuesday in a single-lane stretch of the canal, about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. A team from Boskalis, a Dutch firm specializing in salvaging, is working with the canal authority. using tugboats and a specialized suction dredger that is trying to remove sand and mud from around the port side of the bow. Egyptian authorities have prohibited media access to the site. An attempt Friday to free it failed, said Bernhard Schulte Ship management, the technical manager of the Ever Given. Plans are in the works to pump water from interior spaces of the vessel, and two more tugs should arrive by Sunday, the company said.   The Suez Canal Authority said it welcomed international offers of help. A U.S. defense official said Washington has offered Egypt assistance, including possible naval aid, and they are in discussions about how best to help. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss aid that has not yet been finalized. The canal authority released a video showing Lt. Gen. Osama Rabei inspecting efforts to free the Ever Given and telling workers: “Good luck, God willing.” An initial investigation showed the vessel ran aground due to strong winds and ruled out mechanical or engine failure as a cause, the company said. GAC, a global shipping and logistics company, had previously said the ship had experienced a power blackout, but it did not elaborate.   Bernhard Schulte said two canal pilots had been aboard the ship when it got stuck. Such an arrangement is customary, but the ship’s captain retains ultimate authority over the vessel, according to shipping experts. In addition to the over 200 vessels waiting near the canal, more than 100 ships were en route to the waterway, according to the data firm Refinitiv. Apparently anticipating long delays, the owners of the stuck vessel diverted a sister ship, the Ever Greet, to head around Africa instead, according to satellite data. Others also are being diverted to avoid the canal. The liquid natural gas carrier Pan Americas changed course in the mid-Atlantic, now aiming south to go around the southern tip of Africa, according to satellite data from MarineTraffic.com.   About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, which is particularly crucial for the transport of oil. The closure also could affect oil and gas shipments to Europe from the Middle East. Oil markets are absorbing the disruption for now, said analyst Toril Bosoni. “Oil inventories have been coming down but they are still relatively ample,” he told The Associated Press, adding that he believes the impact might be more pronounced in the tanker sector than in the oil industry. “We are not losing any oil supply but it will tie up tankers for longer if they have to go around” the tip of Africa, he said, which is roughly an additional two-week trip.   Freeing the Ever Given is “quite a challenge” and could take five days to a week, .Capt. Nick Sloane, a maritime salvage expert who led the high-profile effort to salvage the cruise ship Costa Concordia in 2012 told the AP. The Ever Given’s location, size and large amount of cargo make the operation more complex, Sloane said. The operation should focus initially on dredging the bank and sea floor around it to get it floating again, rather than unloading its cargo, which could take weeks. That’s because the clock is also ticking structurally for the vessel, he added. “The longer it takes, the worse the condition of the ship will become, because she’s slowly sagging,” said Sloane, vice president of the International Salvage Union. “So ships are designed to flex, but not to be kept at that position with a full load of cargo for weeks at a time. So it’s not an easy situation.”   International companies are preparing for the effect that the canal’s blockage will have on supply chains that rely on precise deliveries of goods. Singapore’s Minister of Transport Ong Ye Kung said the country’s port should expect disruptions. “Should that happen, some draw down on inventories will become necessary,” he said on Facebook. The backlog of vessels could stress European ports and the international supply of containers, already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, according to IHS Markit, a business research group. It said 49 container ships were scheduled to pass through the canal in the week since the Ever Given became lodged.   The delay could also result in huge insurance claims by companies, according to Marcus Baker, global head of Marine & Cargo at the insurance broker Marsh, with a ship like the Ever Given usually covered at between $100 million to $200 million. Those trying to free the vessel want to avoid complications that could extend the canal closure, according to an Egyptian official at the canal authority. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to talk to journalists. Satellite and photos distributed by the canal authority show Ever Given’s bow touching the eastern wall, while its stern appeared lodged against the western wall.   The Ever Given was involved in an accident in northern Germany in 2019, when it ran into a small ferry moored on the Elbe River in Hamburg. No passengers were on the ferry at the time and there were no injuries, but it was seriously damaged. Hamburg prosecutors opened an investigation of the Ever Given’s captain and pilot on suspicion of endangering shipping traffic, but shelved it in 2020 for lack of evidence, spokeswoman Liddy Oechtering told The Associated Press. Oechtering also could not say what the investigation had determined the cause of the crash was, but officials at the time suggested that strong winds may have blown the slow moving cargo ship into the ferry.  ",

   "text":"  Addressing Bangladesh's 50th Independence anniversary at the National Parade Square  in Dhaka in the presence of his counterpart Sheikh Hasina on the first day of his two-day visit that began on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled the immense contribution of the founder of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the sacrifices made by both the Indian Army and the people of Bangladesh in securing independence from Pakistan. PM Modi also revealed that he had participated in a “Satyagraha” in India in 1971 as a youth in support of Bangladesh’s struggle for independence and had even courted arrest and gone to jail. He recalled the atrocities and heinous crimes committed by the Pakistani Army in 1971 on the people of Bangladesh and said photographs of these did not let people sleep for days. The high-profile visit of PM Modi began on a stormy note, with four supporters of hardline Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam being shot dead after violence erupted at Hathazari, a rural town, according to international news agency reports from Dhaka. The four were apparently shot dead during protests being staged by the Islamist group against PM Modi’s visit. Ruhul Amin, the government administrator of Hathazari town, told news agency AFP that upto 1,500 supporters of the hardline group attacked a police station chanting anti-Modi slogans. Other reports said hundreds of protesters also staged protests outside Dhaka’s Baitul Mokarram Mosque to oppose the visit, resulting in clashes and injuries after they attacked the Police.   Meanwhile, in a special gesture, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Ministers from her cabinet welcomed PM Modi at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on his arrival in Dhaka earlier in the day. A salute of 19 guns and Guard of honour were accorded to PM Modi. The Bangladesh PM praised India for its current development partnership and support during the Covid Pandemic and recalled the historic support of India for the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971. She also recalled the horrific assassination nearly 46 years ago of her father and founder of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujib on August 15, 1975, and the killing of several of her family members on that day. Sheikh Hasina was abroad at the time.   Earlier in the day, soon after his arrival in Dhaka, PM Modi visited the National Martyrs’ Memorial (Jatiyo Sriti Shoudho), the National monument of Bangladesh, at Savar, about 35 km north-west of Dhaka  to pay tributes to the valour and the sacrifice of those who gave their lives in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. PM Modi signed the visitor’s book in the monument and wrote, “I pray that the eternal flame at Savar remains a lasting reminder of the noble victory of truth and courage over deceit and oppression.” Bangladesh is celebrating 50 years of its existence this year and both countries are also celebrating 50 years of establishment of diplomatic relations with each other this year. The Indian armed forces’ victory over Pakistan in the war in December, 1971, had led to the liberation of the erstwhile East Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh as an Independent nation. The Pakistani Army’s crackdown began in March, 1971, and officially three million people were killed during the nine-month long war. PM Modi’s “historic visit is to celebrate Mujib Borsho- the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman ; 50 years of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh; and 50 years of Bangladesh’s war of liberation”.   Paying homage to the martyrs of the freedom struggle, PM Modi said, “The photographs showing the atrocities and heinous crimes committed by the Pakistani Army did not let people sleep for days. We will not forget those who secured independence for Bangladesh by sacrificing oceans of blood. We will not forget (their sacrifice). ... Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman emerged as a ray of hope or the people both here and in India.” PM Modi added, “I must have been 20-22 years of age when I along with several of my colleagues offered a Satyagraha in support of Bangladesh’s struggle for Independence. I courted arrest while supporting the struggle for Bangladesh’s independence and went to jail.” PM Modi also recalled the efforts of the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during the Bangladesh liberation war.   PM Modi further said, “I salute the brave soldiers of the Indian Army who stood with the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh in Muktijuddo (liberation war). Those who gave their blood in ‘Muktijuddo’, sacrificed themselves, and played a very big role in realising the dream of independent Bangladesh. This is one of the most memorable days of my life. I am grateful that Bangladesh has included me in this event. I am grateful that Bangladesh has invited India to take part in this function. It is a matter of our pride that we got the opportunity to honour Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with the Gandhi Peace Prize.” India had conferred the prestigious award posthumously on Sheikh Mujib for the year 2020 just ahead of the visit.   PM Modi also praised the leadership of his counterpart Sheikh Hasina and mentioned the rapid strides in development made by Bangladesh under her leadership. He said Bangladesh had proved those wrong who had raised doubts and questioned the identity of Bangladesh. He also spoke about the current strong ties between the two nations, the supply of Indian-manufactured Covid vaccines to Bangladesh and landmark agreements between the two nations such as the Land Boundary Agreement. “We must remember that we've similar opportunities in fields of trade and commerce, but at the same time, we've similar threats like terrorism. The ideas and powers behind such types of inhumane acts are still active. We must remain vigilant and united to counter them,” PM Modi said, adding that both India and Bangladesh have the power of democracy and vision for the future, and it is necessary for the region the two countries progress together. “That is why Indian and Bangladeshi governments are making meaningful efforts in this direction,” he said. \r\n \r\nDuring the course of the day, he also met met Political leaders from Bangladesh’s ruling 14 Party Alliance and discussed “diverse issues of bilateral relations were held during the meeting to strengthen ties between the two nations”. But he also met met and interacted with opposition leaders from various political parties of Bangladesh. Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Dr A.K. Abdul Momen also called on PM Modi. Apart from this, PM Modi also met the Community leaders including Representatives of Minorities in Bangladesh, Bangladeshi Mukhtijoddhas (freedom fighters), Friends of India and Youth Icons.   Meanwhile, Bangladesh Police said four bodies of members of Hefazat-e-Islam, a hardline Islamist group, were brought to Chittagong Medical College Hospital after violence erupted at Hathazari, a rural town where the group's main leaders are based. “We got four bodies here. They are all hit with bullets. Three of them are madrasa students and another a tailor,” Alauddin Talukder, a police inspector at the hospital, told news agency AFP. He said at least four other demonstrators were critically injured but did not say who opened fire. Ruhul Amin, the government administrator of Hathazari town, said upto 1,500 supporters of Hefazat attacked a police station chanting anti-Modi slogans. “They attacked us all of a sudden,\" he said, without confirming whether any protesters were killed. Hathazari is home to one of Bangladesh's largest madrasas and is the headquarters of the Hefazat, which was formed in 2010 and is believed to be the country's largest hardline Islamist outfit.   According to other international news agency reports, by Friday afternoon, hundreds of protesters had also gathered outside Dhaka’s Baitul Mokarram Mosque after which violent clashes broke out after one faction of protesters began waving their shoes as a sign of disrespect to PM Modi, while another group tried to stop them. Protesters reportedly threw stones at the police, who were heavily present on the streets near the Mosque.",
