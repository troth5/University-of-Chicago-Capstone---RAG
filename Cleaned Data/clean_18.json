A mother mourning the death of her infant, lost to malnutrition and malaria. A young boy uses paper currency to weave a makeshift purse, simply because inflation has rendered cash practically worthless. \n     These are some of the scenes witnessed by CBS News' Adriana Diaz and her team as they walked through the streets of Caracas, Venezuela. As Juan Guaidó and Nicolás Maduro continue their  , the people continue to suffer in a crippled economy. They bear the brunt of a deadly socioeconomic spiral that the paralyzed government can't control. On Sunday, thousands of Venezuelans held a vigil for five people killed in protests that were sparked after Guaidó called for   last Tuesday. But the high-level military defections   never materialized, and Diaz described the protests that followed over the weekend as \"lackluster.\" \n  \n  \n\n \n Traveling through Caracas, Diaz documented scenes of people digging through bags of half-eaten garage for their next meal, their only choice considering the exorbitant cost of food. With inflation at more than  , money is basically worthless. One boy showed CBS News how he folds and weaves paper bills to build a makeshift purse, explaining that money is more valuable to weave than to spend. \n\n           Perhaps most affecting are the scenes of families wracked by poverty and death. The child mortality rate in Venezuela has increased 140 percent, compared to 2008 levels. Diaz spoke with Nairobi Sortaga, whose infant son died in February from malnutrition and meningitis, weighing only 13 pounds at 1-year-old. Inside her impoverished home, an empty cupboard contained a small bag of lentils to feed Sortaga and her two daughters. \"It's not my fault,\" she said, wiping away tears. Before the country's crisis, Sortaga worked as a cleaner in Venezuela's Supreme Court building. Now she can't find a job in the collapsed economy. The government provides subsidized food boxes irregularly. \n     She said they're surviving thanks to free meals provided by  . The 3-year-old organization provides a meal a day to 10,000 children in community kitchens across Caracas.

The convictions of Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, had drawn condemnation from rights groups, Western governments and press associations, and the two journalists had garnered several awards and other honors.  \n     In April, they shared with their Reuters colleagues the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting, one of journalism's highest honors. The two were freed after President Win Myint issued a blanket pardon for 6,520 prisoners, said Zaw Zaw, chief of Insein Prison in the country's largest city, Yangon. \n  \n  \n\n \n Myanmar's Supreme Court on April 23 had   of their seven-year prison terms. Their convictions were related to reporting on security forces' abuses of the Muslim Rohingya minority. The reporters contended they were framed because of official displeasure over their reporting. \"I want to say that I am very happy today,\" Wa Lone said to reporters who had gathered in front of the prison. \"I want to thank our friends and families who were trying for our freedom and also to those from all over the world who sympathized with us.\" \"I am really excited to see my family and colleges. I can't wait to go to my newsroom,\" he said. Reuters colleagues drove them away to be reunited with their wives and children. \n\n    \n           Their wives sent the government a letter in pleading for a pardon, Reuters reported, \"not, they said, because their husbands had done anything wrong, but because it would allow them to be released from prison and reunited with their families.\" \n     Myanmar's military launched a   in the western state of Rakhine in 2017, driving more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. U.N. officials and others charge the campaign amounted to ethnic cleansing, and even genocide. The military has said its actions in Rakhine state were a response to attacks by Rohingya guerrillas, and it did not have a policy violating human rights or the laws of war. The Reuters reporters had worked on an investigation of the killings of 10 Rohingya villagers in Inn Din village, for which the government last year said seven soldiers were sentenced to up 10 years in prison with hard labor. \n\n           The two reporters were arrested in December 2017 and sentenced last September after being accused of illegally possessing official documents, a violation of the colonial-era Official Secrets Act. \"We are enormously pleased that Myanmar has released our courageous reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo,\" said a statement issued by Reuters Editor in Chief Stephen Adler. \"Since their arrests 511 days ago, they have become symbols of the importance of press freedom around the world. We welcome their return.\" The U.S. Embassy also welcomed the news, according to Reuters. The case drew attention not only as a media freedom issue but also as an example of how democratic reforms in long-isolated Myanmar have stalled under Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government, which took power in 2016. \n     The military maintains control of key ministries, including those handling security, but Suu Kyi wields executive power and her stance on the Rohingya crisis has disappointed many admirers and dampened hopes for greater democracy in the country. \n\n           The United Nations office in Myanmar said it welcomed the journalists' release. \"The U.N. in Myanmar considers the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo a step toward improving the freedom of the press and a sign of Government's commitment to Myanmar's transition to democracy,\" it said in an emailed statement. The attorney for the two men, Amal Clooney, issued a statement saying that, Since taking on this case over a year ago, I have witnessed incredible determination by Reuters, in particular editor-in-chief Steve Adler and Chief Counsel Gail Gove, in their pursuit of justice for their brave reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. It is inspiring to see a news organization so committed to the protection of innocent men and the profession of journalism. It has been an honour to represent Reuters and the two journalists in this case and I hope that their release signals a renewed commitment to press freedom in Myanmar.\" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch, also applauded the release, but noted Myanmar is prosecuting other bloggers and journalists for their reporting on the military and the government. \"Myanmar's faltering respect for media freedom indicates the dire situation facing human rights and democracy as the country moves toward national   in 2020,\" he said in an emailed statement. Family members of the two reporters were elated. \n     Chit Su Win, the wife of Kyaw Soe Oo, said just before their reunion that she doesn't know how to express her feelings, but \"Now the three of us can hug each other and we are so happy for that.\" Maung Saung Kha, director of \"Athan\"- Freedom of Expression Movement from Myanmar - said he still has concerns about freedom of expression in Myanmar, because there are still trials of journalists. The online magazine The Irrawaddy and other media outlets have been sued by the army for their coverage of recent fighting between the government and the Arakan Army ethnic rebel group, which also operates in Rakhine state.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/44b86e8d-aca3-45fc-9d4c-09f9bac37986/thumbnail/620x420/36281675b64d17352b16aaab8f39dd4a/2019-05-07t044940z-1530359020-rc1a801595a0-rtrmadp-3-myanmar-journalists.jpg#\" alt=\"Reuters reporter Wa Lone poses with wife Pan Ei Mon and daughter, along with Reuters reporter Kyaw Soe Oo carrying his daughter next to wife Chit Su Win, after being freed from prison, after receiving a presidential pardon in Yangon \" height=\"420\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/44b86e8d-aca3-45fc-9d4c-09f9bac37986/thumbnail/620x420/36281675b64d17352b16aaab8f39dd4a/2019-05-07t044940z-1530359020-rc1a801595a0-rtrmadp-3-myanmar-journalists.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/44b86e8d-aca3-45fc-9d4c-09f9bac37986/thumbnail/1240x840/8600821b7d95737e227904b9daf0db51/2019-05-07t044940z-1530359020-rc1a801595a0-rtrmadp-3-myanmar-journalists.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20420'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 103957", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

But it's not too late to fix the problem, according to the United Nations' first   on biodiversity. \n     \"We have reconfigured dramatically life on the planet,\" report co-chairman Eduardo Brondizio of Indiana University said at a press conference. Species loss is accelerating to a rate tens or hundreds of times faster than in the past, the report said. More than half a million species on land \"have insufficient habitat for long-term survival\" and are likely to go extinct, many within decades, unless their habitats are restored. The oceans are not any better off. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"Humanity unwittingly is attempting to throttle the living planet and humanity's own future,\" said George Mason University biologist Thomas Lovejoy, who has been called the godfather of biodiversity for his research. He was not part of the report. \"The biological diversity of this planet has been really hammered, and this is really our last chance to address all of that,\" Lovejoy said. \n\n           Patricia Miloslavich, a contributor to the report and senior professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at Universidad Simón Bolívar, spoke with \" \" on Monday about the conclusions. \"We have seen in the past that history has taught us there have been mass extinctions. This, however cannot be considered a mass extinction. This is just a loss of species at an unprecedented rate due to human intervention,\" she said. \"The drivers of this species loss and ecosystem loss is our extreme changes in the use of the land and the oceans.\"  \n\n           Conservation scientists from around the world convened in Paris to issue the report, which exceeded 1,000 pages. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) included more than 450 researchers who used 15,000 scientific and government reports. The report's summary had to be approved by representatives of all 109 nations. \n     Some nations hit harder by the losses, like small island countries, wanted more in the report. Others, such as the United States, were cautious in the language they sought, but they agreed \"we're in trouble,\" said Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist for the World Wildlife Fund, who observed the final negotiations. \"This is the strongest call we've seen for reversing the trends on the loss of nature,\" Shaw said. The findings are not just about saving plants and animals, but about preserving a world that's becoming harder for humans to live in, said Robert Watson, a former top NASA and British scientist who headed the report. \"We are indeed threatening the potential food security, water security, human health and social fabric\" of humanity, Watson told The Associated Press. It's also an economic and security issue as countries fight over scarcer resources. Watson said the poor in less developed countries bear the greatest burden. \n\n    \n           The report's 39-page summary highlighted five ways people are reducing biodiversity: Overfishing the world's oceans. A third of the world's fish stocks are overfished. \"The key to remember is, it's not a terminal diagnosis,\" said report co-author Andrew Purvis of the Natural History Museum in London. \n     Marine biologist Jon Witman from Brown University, who travels to the Galápagos Islands regularly to monitor the effects of climate change on local species, spoke about the threat in the recent CBSN Originals documentary,  \"There's no doubt we are in an unprecedented period of global stress in terms of climate impacts. And basically  the natural world is being hit by what I call the big three. Certainly climate change is up there. Habitat destruction by humans is absolutely key. And we're also adding pollution to the ecosystem. It sounds pretty grim, and it is grim,\" Whitman said. Professor Miloslavich told CBS News that what's happening in the world today is different than the natural process that led some species to go extinct in past eras. \"It's true there have been extinctions in the past, that nature has taken its course, it's just that these have been processes that have taken millions of years and nature has had the time to adapt and provide a response,\" she said. \"We are not giving nature a time to provide a response.\" \n\n           Fighting climate change and saving species are equally important, the report said, and working on both environmental problems should go hand in hand. Both problems exacerbate each other because a warmer world means fewer species, and a less biodiverse world means fewer trees and plants to remove heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the air, Lovejoy said. — Turning forests, grasslands and other areas into farms, cities and other developments. The habitat loss leaves plants and animals homeless. About three-quarters of Earth's land, two-thirds of its oceans and 85 percent of crucial wetlands have been severely altered or lost, making it harder for species to survive, the report said. The world's   are a perfect example of where climate change and species loss intersect. If the world warms another 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius), which other reports say is likely, coral reefs will probably dwindle by 70 percent to 90 percent, the report said. At 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius), the report said, 99% of the world's coral will be in trouble. \n     \"Business as usual is a disaster,\" Watson said. \n    \n           At least 680 species with backbones have already gone extinct since 1600. The report said 559 domesticated breeds of mammals used for food have disappeared. More than 40% of the world's amphibian species, more than one-third of the marine mammals and nearly one-third of sharks and fish are threatened with extinction. The report relies heavily on research by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, which is composed of biologists who maintain a list of threatened species. The IUCN calculated in March that 27,159 species are threatened, endangered or extinct in the wild out of nearly 100,000 species biologists examined in depth. That includes 1,223 mammal species, 1,492 bird species and 2,341 fish species. Nearly half the threatened species are plants. Scientists have only examined a small fraction of the estimated 8 million species on Earth. The report comes up with 1 million species in trouble by extrapolating the IUCN's 25 percent threatened rate to the rest of the world's species and using a lower rate for the estimated 5.5 million species of insects, Watson said. Outside scientists, such as Lovejoy and others, said that's a reasonable assessment. \n     The report gives only a generic \"within decades\" time frame for species loss because it is dependent on many variables, including taking the problem seriously, which can reduce the severity of the projections, Watson said. \"We're in the middle of the sixth great extinction crisis, but it's happening in slow motion,\" said Conservation International and University of California Santa Barbara ecologist Lee Hannah, who was not part of the report. Five times in the past,   where much of life on the planet blinked out, like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Watson said the report was careful not to call what's going on now as a sixth big die-off because current levels don't come close to the 75% level in past mass extinctions. \n\n    \n           The report goes beyond species. Of the 18 measured ways nature helps humans, the report said 14 are declining, with food and energy production noticeable exceptions. The report found downward trends in nature's ability to provide clean air and water, good soil and other essentials. Habitat loss is one of the biggest threats, and it's happening worldwide, Watson said. The report projects 15.5 million miles (25 million kilometers) of new roads will be paved over nature between now and 2050, most in the developing world. Many of the worst effects can be prevented by changing the way we grow food, produce energy, deal with climate change and dispose of waste, the report said. That involves concerted action by governments, companies and people. Individuals can help with simple changes to the way they eat and use energy, said the co-chairman of the report, ecological scientist Josef Settele of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany. That doesn't mean becoming a vegetarian or vegan, but balancing meat, vegetables and fruit, and walking and biking more, Watson said. \n     \"We can actually feed all the coming billions of people without destroying another inch of nature,\" Lovejoy said. Much of that can be done by eliminating food waste and being more efficient, he said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/09/e151b203-86ea-432e-a21e-6adc9063d8dc/thumbnail/620x451/dce0a313bedcaee7719218c159484fd1/hawaiian-monk-seal-promo.jpg#\" alt=\"hawaiian-monk-seal-promo.jpg \" height=\"451\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/09/e151b203-86ea-432e-a21e-6adc9063d8dc/thumbnail/620x451/dce0a313bedcaee7719218c159484fd1/hawaiian-monk-seal-promo.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/09/e151b203-86ea-432e-a21e-6adc9063d8dc/thumbnail/1240x902/66d77ea89fca45dabfc696b2bf9c4e4c/hawaiian-monk-seal-promo.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20451'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 103957", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.catchnews.com", "section": "NEWS", "sub_section": ["/science-news/page-17/"], "article_url": "http://www.catchnews.com/science-news/scientists-develop-world-s-first-porous-liquid-to-filter-carbon-emissions-1447734344.html", "title": "Scientists develop world's first 'porous' liquid to filter carbon emissions ", "author": null, "author_link": "http://www.catchnews.com/author/news-agencies-1472728714.html", "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "In a breakthrough, scientists have developed the world's first 'porous' liquid that can potentially be used to capture harmful carbon emissions to prevent them from entering the Earth's atmosphere.

This \"digital patch\" is the first new effective treatment for lazy eye in half a century, researchers from the Glick Eye Institute at Indiana University said. Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, remains the most common cause of visual impairment in children. Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not develop normally during early childhood. This can occur when one eye is much more nearsighted than the other, or when one eye wanders or strays inward. The child needs to receive treatment by the age of 8 or so while their eyes and brain are still developing, or he or she could become blind in the weaker eye. A recent study found that 1 in 4 kids feel anxiety before using eye drops. Nearly 15 percent refuse to take eye drops at all. Both drops and eye patches work based on the occlusion method. This blocks vision in the eye with the best sight, forcing the brain to rely on the so-called lazy eye. During the process, vision improves though many children will still need glasses to correct their eyesight. In comparison, the electronic glasses used in the study combine vision correction and occlusion. The lenses can be filled to a child's vision prescription. Because the lenses are liquid crystal display (LCD), they can also be programmed to turn opaque, occluding vision in the left or right eye for different time intervals, acting like a digital patch that flickers on and off. Researchers recently tested the effectiveness of occlusion glasses compared to patching in a randomised clinical study. They recruited 33 subjects with lazy eye between age 3 and 8 who wore spectacles to correct their vision. One group wore an adhesive patch for two hours daily. The other wore Amblyz occlusion glasses for 4 hours daily. In the study, the lens over the eye with better vision switched from clear to opaque every 30 seconds. After three months, both groups of children showed the same amount of improvement in the lazy eye, gaining two lines on a reading chart. \"When you talk to adults who underwent childhood treatment for amblyopia, they will tell you that wearing a patch was the worst thing ever,\" said Daniel Neely, a paediatric ophthalmology professor at Indiana University who led the study. \"With these electronic occlusion glasses, the child learns that the lens will be clear again in just a few seconds so they may be more cooperative with the treatment. For parents who have struggled with drops and patching, this could be a great alternative,\" said Neely.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 103957", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

He also said they were in good position in the first two days of the pink-ball Test. “We had two good days but had just one bad hour where we lost completely. The talk in the dressing room was about backing ourselves as an individual and as a team and stick to the plan whatever it is,” he added on the eve of the second Test. However, Kohli’s departure weakened the Indian batting a bit in trouble and Rahane conceded that they would miss their skipper. There were suggestions to promote himself to No.4 but the middle-order batsman said they have not decided anything yet. “Openers role is crucial but I don’t want to put pressure on them. Just want to give them freedom to play. We will definitely miss Virat. When you have a player like him, it is great for the team.” \nIndia looked in a good position with Kohli and Rahane batting well in the first innings before Kohli was run out. Speaking about the incident, he revealed the momentum shifted in hosts’ favour. “It was a tough one. We were going really well. I saw the momentum going in Australia’s way after the run out. After the end of play, I said sorry to him (Kohli) and he was ok with it. He understood the situation. Such things happen and you have to respect that and move forward.” He further informed that Kohli had a message for the team before heading to India. “He spoke to all of us before leaving. We had a team dinner in Adelaide. He spoke about playing to our strength. We have been playing well. We have to help each other and enjoy each other’s success.” The bowling department will be without Mohammad Shami, who was injured and ruled out of the remainder of the series but the 32-year-old said they are capable of delivering the goods. “Bumrah is a quality bowler and he has been doing really well. Apart from that, Umesh (Yadav) and a guy who will play (Mohammad Siraj), it is about bowling in partnerships. We have discussed how to go about it. It is about bowling in partnerships and bowling towards the plan.” When asked about Australia coach Justin Langer’s comments where he said Indians were under stress after the loss, Rahane added, “Australians are very good at playing mind games. Let them do that. We are focusing on ourselves on what we need to do. We will back ourselves and be positive,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

The Magalu announcement quickly reverberated across the Brazilian media landscape.

Of course, such a move in the United States would immediately run afoul of long-established laws stemming from Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which set up the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) to adjudicate race-based hiring, firing and promotional grievances. Seminal cases such as  ,   and  , among many others, served to advance the legal structure through which American companies now deal with matters of race and equity in the workplace.

Lyubov Sobol, a key figure in Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained for 48 hours after a day of interrogation on charges of violent trespassing. The move followed Sobol’s attempt on Monday to enter the Moscow apartment of the alleged operative, whom Navalny had previously duped into describing details of the alleged poisoning.  Sobol has denied the accusations and insisted that she violated no law by ringing the doorbell to the apartment. While Sobol was being questioned, the state Investigative Committee issued a statement accusing her of trespassing — charges her colleagues have rejected. Earlier this week, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he identified as Konstantin Kudryavtsev and described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him with the Soviet-era Novichok agent in August and then tried to cover it up. Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned. In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake.

Opposition supporters have rallied for weeks, urging Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down over the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim control over large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. The Russia-brokered agreement ended 44 days of fierce fighting in which the Azerbaijani army routed Armenian forces. Pashinyan has defended the peace deal as a painful but necessary move to prevent Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region. He argued Friday that his critics lack broad public support for their demand. “I’m not clinging to the prime minister’s seat, but I can’t carelessly treat the post given to me by the people,” he said on Facebook. Pashinyan added that he was ready to hold consultations with the nation’s political parties to discuss calling an early parliamentary election next year. Opposition supporters on Friday continued blocking streets in the Armenian capital and engaged in occasional scuffles with police. Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands. Heavy fighting that erupted in late September marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 5,600 people on both sides. The Russia-brokered peace agreement stipulated that Armenia hand over control of some areas it holds outside Nagorno-Karabakh’s borders. Azerbaijan also retained control over areas of Nagorno-Karabakh it had taken during the conflict. The peace deal was celebrated in Azerbaijan as a major triumph, and triggered outrage and mass protests in Armenia.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 103958", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The gunbattle Thursday paralyzed the capital of Mexico’s Sinaloa state and left the streets littered with burning vehicles. Five attackers, a member of the National Guard, a civilian and a prisoner were killed, Mexican Defense Secretary Luís Cresencio Sandoval said. Sinaloa Public Security Secretary Cristóbal Castañeda said earlier that 21 people were wounded and that 27 inmates escaped from a prison. Sandoval said the forces were on an operation to arrest Ovidio Guzmán López, a son of the convicted Sinaloa cartel boss. The younger Guzman was wanted for extradition to the U.S. That sequence of events clashed with an initial account by federal Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo, who said 30 members of the National Guard and army were on patrol in Culiacan when they were fired on from a house and found the younger Guzmán inside. Heavily armed gunmen in greater force then surrounded the house, and authorities decided to suspend the operation, Durazo said. Durazo told Televisa that security forces had entered the house but left without Guzman. “With the goal of safeguarding the well-being and tranquility of Culiacan society, officials in the security cabinet decided to suspend the actions,” Durazo said. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he supported the decision to pull back. “The capture of one criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people,” López Obrador said, calling the response to the operation “very violent” and saying many lives were put at risk. “This decision was made to protect citizens. … You cannot fight fire with fire,” he added. “We do not want deaths. We do not want war.” José Luis González Meza, a lawyer for El Chapo’s family, told The Associated Press that Guzmán’s family reported “Ovidio is alive and free” but that he had no more details. The elder Guzman   in the U.S. after being convicted last February of industrial-scale drug trafficking. Ovidio is not one of the drug lord’s best-known sons. Iván Archivaldo Guzmán and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán are known as “Los Chapitos,” or “the little Chapos,” and are believed to be running their father’s cartel, together with Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. But Ovidio Guzmán was indicted in 2018 in Washington, along with a fourth brother, on charges of trafficking in cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. After Ovidio Guzmán was located, Culiacan exploded in violence, with civilians in trucks roaring through the city’s center, shooting what appeared to be .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns. Videos on social media showed a scene resembling a war zone, with gunmen, some in black ski masks, riding in the back of trucks, firing mounted machine guns as vehicles burned. People could be seen running for cover as gunfire rattled around them. Motorists drove in reverse, frantically trying to get away. “Nothing is working,” said Ricardo González, a worker in the state’s congress who shut himself up in his house after picking up his 15-year-old son from school. “There is a psychosis. No one knows what is going on, but everyone is afraid, and they have told us to not come in to work tomorrow.” Castañeda said gunmen blocked streets with burning vehicles to make it difficult for security forces to maneuver. Authorities warned people to avoid going out in parts of city. Sinaloa’s soccer club Dorados canceled its game Thursday, and schools suspended classes.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 103959", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

This \"digital patch\" is the first new effective treatment for lazy eye in half a century, researchers from the Glick Eye Institute at Indiana University said. Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, remains the most common cause of visual impairment in children. Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not develop normally during early childhood. This can occur when one eye is much more nearsighted than the other, or when one eye wanders or strays inward. The child needs to receive treatment by the age of 8 or so while their eyes and brain are still developing, or he or she could become blind in the weaker eye. A recent study found that 1 in 4 kids feel anxiety before using eye drops. Nearly 15 percent refuse to take eye drops at all. Both drops and eye patches work based on the occlusion method. This blocks vision in the eye with the best sight, forcing the brain to rely on the so-called lazy eye. During the process, vision improves though many children will still need glasses to correct their eyesight. In comparison, the electronic glasses used in the study combine vision correction and occlusion. The lenses can be filled to a child's vision prescription. Because the lenses are liquid crystal display (LCD), they can also be programmed to turn opaque, occluding vision in the left or right eye for different time intervals, acting like a digital patch that flickers on and off. Researchers recently tested the effectiveness of occlusion glasses compared to patching in a randomised clinical study. They recruited 33 subjects with lazy eye between age 3 and 8 who wore spectacles to correct their vision. One group wore an adhesive patch for two hours daily. The other wore Amblyz occlusion glasses for 4 hours daily. In the study, the lens over the eye with better vision switched from clear to opaque every 30 seconds. After three months, both groups of children showed the same amount of improvement in the lazy eye, gaining two lines on a reading chart. \"When you talk to adults who underwent childhood treatment for amblyopia, they will tell you that wearing a patch was the worst thing ever,\" said Daniel Neely, a paediatric ophthalmology professor at Indiana University who led the study. \"With these electronic occlusion glasses, the child learns that the lens will be clear again in just a few seconds so they may be more cooperative with the treatment. For parents who have struggled with drops and patching, this could be a great alternative,\" said Neely.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 103958", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Royals have a way of taking their time about naming babies and the couple is known to want to do things at their own pace, so it may be a few days before the couple reveals the name for their first child. \n     Britain's legal bookmakers Tuesday reported high interest in the names Alexander, James, Philip and Arthur. Bookmakers also report speculation about the name Spencer, the maiden name of Harry's late mother, Princess Diana. There was speculation, meanwhile, that the royal birth didn't go completely according to plan. As CBS News contributor Tina Brown, author of \"The Diana Chronicles,\" told \" \" on Tuesday, there were unconfirmed reports that Meghan was rushed to a hospital either early Monday or late Sunday, in spite of her hopes for a home birth. The palace would not immediately comment on the reports. \n  \n  \n\n \n Either way, both mother and son were said to be doing well, and that left royal watchers around the world to speculate on the child's name on Tuesday.  Choosing Spencer as a first or middle name is seen as a way for Harry to honor Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 when he was only 12. He spoke before he married Meghan last year about his desire to pay tribute to her memory during the ceremony. \n\n           Others believe Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, will choose a name that reflects her American heritage. The infant, known only as Baby Sussex for the moment, was born early Monday morning. \n     Harry said when he announced the birth Monday that he and Meghan were \"thinking\" about names and hinted that an announcement might be made on Wednesday on shortly thereafter. The couple is also expected to pose with their newborn or release a photo on their Instagram account. The couple is also expected to name godparents to the child at a future date. \n    \n          ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/19/4efba391-7049-4ef3-b02e-7c7c78fb26ca/thumbnail/620x349/e3aa0086d367af1f08c75ede0812af6a/gettyimages-960056614.jpg#\" alt=\"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding \" height=\"349\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/19/4efba391-7049-4ef3-b02e-7c7c78fb26ca/thumbnail/620x349/e3aa0086d367af1f08c75ede0812af6a/gettyimages-960056614.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/19/4efba391-7049-4ef3-b02e-7c7c78fb26ca/thumbnail/1240x698/4b4e13da2c549a34a83e65e6860256b7/gettyimages-960056614.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 103959", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

A mother mourning the death of her infant, lost to malnutrition and malaria. A young boy uses paper currency to weave a makeshift purse, simply because inflation has rendered cash practically worthless. \n     These are some of the scenes witnessed by CBS News' Adriana Diaz and her team as they walked through the streets of Caracas, Venezuela. As Juan Guaidó and Nicolás Maduro continue their  , the people continue to suffer in a crippled economy. They bear the brunt of a deadly socioeconomic spiral that the paralyzed government can't control. On Sunday, thousands of Venezuelans held a vigil for five people killed in protests that were sparked after Guaidó called for   last Tuesday. But the high-level military defections   never materialized, and Diaz described the protests that followed over the weekend as \"lackluster.\" \n  \n  \n\n \n Traveling through Caracas, Diaz documented scenes of people digging through bags of half-eaten garage for their next meal, their only choice considering the exorbitant cost of food. With inflation at more than  , money is basically worthless. One boy showed CBS News how he folds and weaves paper bills to build a makeshift purse, explaining that money is more valuable to weave than to spend. \n\n           Perhaps most affecting are the scenes of families wracked by poverty and death. The child mortality rate in Venezuela has increased 140 percent, compared to 2008 levels. Diaz spoke with Nairobi Sortaga, whose infant son died in February from malnutrition and meningitis, weighing only 13 pounds at 1-year-old. Inside her impoverished home, an empty cupboard contained a small bag of lentils to feed Sortaga and her two daughters. \"It's not my fault,\" she said, wiping away tears. Before the country's crisis, Sortaga worked as a cleaner in Venezuela's Supreme Court building. Now she can't find a job in the collapsed economy. The government provides subsidized food boxes irregularly. \n     She said they're surviving thanks to free meals provided by  . The 3-year-old organization provides a meal a day to 10,000 children in community kitchens across Caracas. Instead of handouts, they provide ingredients and pots to community members, who then run the kitchens on their own.

However, the experienced coach Manolo Marquez Roca feels the result will not affect their morale going into their next match against Kerala Blasters. Speaking on the eve of their ISL clash against strugglers Kerala, who are placed at ninth without a win yet, the Spaniard felt Mumbai City FC were a strong team and they were good on the day. “In football, there are three possibilities: win, draw or loss. It is impossible to maintain only one. After losing one game, no team becomes bad. I think the loss against Mumbai does not affect our team for tomorrow’s game. We will go out to play a good game and win tomorrow,” he said. On being asked about the loss against strong opponents Mumbai and not converting the chances, he said, “I don’t think we created too many chances. I only remember one clear chance from (Mohammad) Yasir one minute before the half time. With the equaliser, the second half would have been different. But with a young and inexperienced side, I am happy with the way they played in the second half.” Speaking about their opponents Kerala Blasters, he rated the team very high on talent. “For me it is a very good team. They played an open game in the championship against ATK and they didn’t deserve to lose. In the last game, they equalised in injury time. They have got good players and they deserve more points than what they have now. For sure it will be a tough battle,” he added. When asked about major changes in the upcoming game, he said he does not believe in changing the team because of one loss. “There are a few areas from the Mumbai game where we can improve and change some players maybe. We are not going to make too many tactical changes and we played six games and had only one loss. Can’t change too many things.” He said talented Indian player Nikhil Poojary will be out of this game owing to injuries. “You don’t win games on revealing who is playing or not. For me, the squad is of 29 players and 28 players were training and only one player was out with injury. All other players are in the contention for a place. Only Nikhil is not in the reckoning because of injury,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the recent passing away of Siraj’s father, the celebrations were muted and confined to indoors. But the family members of the fast bowler, who made his Test debut against Australia on Saturday, were excited while they followed the game on the television. The moment Siraj took to the field with his teammates, his mother Shabana Begum’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. Speaking after watching his son don Indian colours, she said her husband’s (Mohammed Ghouse) dream finally fulfilled. “  (It is all the grace of Almighty). Thanks to God, his father would be proud of him today,” she said. When asked about their feeling ahead of his debut, she said, “We got up very early to watch him play. We were excited and happy. But when he took the field and stood there with his teammates singing the national anthem, it brought us tears.” Siraj had a wonderful debut picking up two crucial wickets that helped India skittle out Australia for 195 runs on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. When asked about their feeling after Siraj picked up his first wicket, Shabana said, “We can’t express the feeling. Playing for country has always been his and his father’s dream. Now he made the country proud.” Shabana, who was worried for Siraj for neglecting his studies and focusing on cricket, added she wants her son to win matches for India. Siraj’s grandmother Sardar Bhi said that the family was delighted. “Due to his father’s death, the family mourning will continue for three months. So we told Siraj’s friends not to come to the house for watching the match. We know they are all excited to share their joy with us. But this is a tough time.” “We started getting calls early in the morning when he took those two wickets. We switched off our mobiles and kept it aside to watch the match,” she added. Siraj’s brother Mohammed Ismail said he was over the moon. “I wasn’t feeling well in the morning, so I watched till lunch and slept off. But I have been receiving calls from people congratulating us. It is a great moment for our family,” he added. A long time friend of Siraj, Mohd Shafi said that he is poised for greater things. “I am very happy to see Siraj playing for the country. If his father was here, he would have been very happy. I spoke to his mother, she was also very happy. I spoke to Siraj as well after the first day’s game. He said if people support him, he would do many great things for the country.

Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said the current slowdown in exports is mainly due to a decline in petroleum products, which constitute 13.42 per cent of overall outward shipments. This decline, he said, is mainly on account of fall in petroleum prices which has driven the export value downwards. However, \"the positive growth in the exports of non-conventional commodity groups like electronic goods, drugs, and pharmaceuticals, organic and inorganic chemicals, augurs well for future growth,\" he told PTI. India's export growth is in the negative zone since August 2019 due to a steep fall in shipments of key sectors like petroleum, engineering and gems and jewellery. Labour-intensive sectors such as carpets, ready-made garments, handloom and leather too are recording decline in export growth. As per the World Trade Organization (WTO), global merchandise trade volumes are expected to rise by only 1.2 per cent in 2019, substantially slower than the 2.6 per cent growth forecast in April 2019. However in 2020, the growth in trade volume is projected to accelerate to 2.7 per cent. Apex exporters body Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said the global situation is becoming extremely challenging as rising protectionism is leading to uncertainty. FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai said the global situation is likely to improve in the first half of 2020, which would have a positive impact on India's exports. \"If the global situation improves, which is likely in the first half of 2020, we may look for 15 per cent growth in exports in the next financial year (2020-21). Exports will come out of negative zone next year but the rate of growth will not be in double digits,\" he said. He added that the order book position of Indian exporters is encouraging and less volatility in the domestic currency has also been a positive factor for traders. Sahai also said that Indian exports have to be aligned with changing import patterns of the global economy as 50 per cent of the world imports today is accounted by electrical and electronics products, automobiles, machinery, petroleum products and plastic items. \"While employment-intensive sectors should be pushed in exports, the new strategy should focus on technology-driven sectors,\" he said. Sharing similar views, Professor Rakesh Mohan Joshi from the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) said the steps taken by the government would help exports record growth in 2020. \"There is a need to take structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of Indian products in the global markets,\" Joshi said. The commerce ministry is considering several steps such as the announcement of the new WTO-compliant export incentive scheme and the new foreign trade policy for the next five years in 2020 to push the country's exports. The ministry has conducted a series of meetings with concerned stakeholders to finalise the foreign trade policy. On the trade front, India has been negotiating the mega free trade agreement RCEP  (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) since 2013. But in November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will not join the RCEP deal as negotiations failed to satisfactorily address New Delhi's \"outstanding issues and concerns\". Since January this year, exports have recorded a low rate of growth and slipped into the negative zone in August. During April-November 2019-20, the country's exports contracted by 2 per cent to USD 212 billion. Going by the current trend, FIEO has estimated that the exports may stand at USD 330-340 billion in the current fiscal. In 2018-19, the exports grew by 9 per cent to USD 331 billion from USD 303.5 billion in 2017-18. Since 2011-12, India's exports have been hovering at around USD 300 billion.

Markets steadied after a Chinese spokesman said Monday that envoys still were preparing to go to the U.S., though there was no word then whether Liu would take part. On Tuesday, the Shanghai Composite index surged 0.7 percent, and most other regional markets also rebounded.

A Chinese Commerce Ministry statement announcing Liu's plans gave no indication whether other details such as the size of his delegation might change. \n\n           Washington and Beijing have raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each other's exports, disrupting trade in goods from soybeans to medical equipment. Estimates of lost potential sales so far range as high as $25 billion. Both governments have said negotiations were making progress, but Mr. Trump expressed frustration Sunday at the pace.   Monday that the Chinese government was \"reneging on prior commitments\" that had been negotiated in 10 earlier rounds of talks. He also warned that the higher tariffs on China that Mr. Trump   will take effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time Friday. \n     In response, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing \"is sincere in continuing consultations.\" Asked whether China took President Trump's threat seriously, Geng said similar situations had happened \"many times before.\" \"We hope the United States can still work together with China,\" Geng said at a news briefing. \"On the basis of mutual respect and equality, we will resolve each other's legitimate concerns and strive to reach an agreement of mutual benefit and win-win.\" The conflict is testing how far Beijing is willing to go in changing a state-led economic model it sees as the path to prosperity and global influence -- and how much power Washington will have to enforce any agreement. The U.S. accuses Beijing of pressing foreign companies to hand over technology in exchange for market access, improperly subsidizing Chinese firms and stealing American trade secrets. \n\n           No details of the talks have been released. But private sector analysts said Beijing is willing to change details of its plans so long as it preserves the ruling Communist Party's dominant economic role. The Trump administration has imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and 25 percent tariffs on another $50 billion. The Chinese have retaliated by targeting $110 billion in U.S. imports. Mr. Trump said Sunday he also planned to impose 25 percent tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese products. That would extend penalties to everything China ships to the U.S., its biggest foreign customer. A stumbling block in the talks is U.S. insistence on an enforcement mechanism with penalties if Beijing fails to keep its promises.

The town of Ras al-Ayn, scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the Turkish invasion, was emerging as an immediate test for   agreed on by Washington and Ankara. Before the deal’s announcement, Turkish-backed forces had encircled the town and were battling fierce resistance from Kurdish fighters inside. A spokesman for the Kurdish-led fighters said Friday they were not withdrawing from Ras al-Ayn because Turkish forces are still besieging and shelling it. Elsewhere along the border, calm seemed to prevail. Shelling hit in and around Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, raising columns of smoke, seen by an Associated Press journalist in Ceylanpinar on the Turkish side of the border, but none was seen after noon, and only sporadic gunfire was heard from inside the town. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Rojava Information Center said fighting continued into the afternoon as Turkish-backed Syrian fighters clashed with Kurdish forces in villages on the outskirts of Ras al-Ayn. The Kurdish-led force said five of its fighters were killed and a number of civilians wounded in a Turkish airstrike on one of the villages. Other activists reported a new exodus of civilians from the villages. Gun battles and shelling continued around a hospital in the center of Ras al-Ayn, and injured inside could not be evacuated, said Mustafa Bali, spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The Kurdish Red Crescent said it was unable to enter the town to evacuate wounded because of fighting. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied any fighting took place Friday and said Kurdish fighters had begun withdrawing. Bali said that was not true. “The Turkish land and air bombing continue in Ras al-Ayn,” he said. A senior U.S. official said they were awaiting confirmation on the reported fighting. The official said it takes time for information to filter down to field units especially for forces without strong command and control. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. The cease-fire agreement — reached after hours of negotiations in Turkey’s capital between Erdogan and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence — requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border. That arrangement would largely solidify the position Turkey has gained after days of fighting. The Turks and the Kurds appear to disagree on the size of the area covered by the cease-fire. Turkey calls it a “pause” not a cease-fire. It remains unclear if the Kurdish-led force was on board with pulling back even if a pause in fighting firmly takes hold. Pence said the U.S. was already coordinating with it on a withdrawal. But American sway with the group has diminished after President Donald Trump turned his back on it by withdrawing U.S. soldiers from northeast Syria, opening the way for Turkey to launch its invasion 10 days ago. The Kurdish-led force’s commander, Mazloum Abdi, said Thursday night that it would abide by the cease-fire and “do our best to make it successful.” He did not mention any withdrawal. Asked about a withdrawal, a force spokesman, Mervan, said “so far there is nothing,” pointing to the continuing siege of Ras al-Ayn. “It seems that under this deal they want to commit more massacres,” he said. He uses a nom de guerre in accordance with the group’s regulations. A member of the Syrian Kurdish force ruled out any pull-back from border towns, calling the U.S. deal with Turkey an “insult” and saying “no way this will work.” “They think we will just leave our land and our people to Turks if we are asked,” he said. “They can come and take the land by force. Nobody should expect us to leave our land.” “How does the U.S. think to enforce a deal without presence on the ground?” he added, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. Elsewhere, no fighting was heard Friday along the stretch of the border that has been the main theater of the Turkish assault, running from Ras al-Ayn about 125 kilometers (75 miles) west to the Turkish-held town of Tal Abyad. Kurdish fighters have already been driven out of much, but not all, of that territory. Trump framed the U.S. cease-fire deal with Turkey as   but it aims to patch up a foreign policy crisis widely seen to be of his own making. Turkish troops and their allied Syrian fighters launched the offensive two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing American troops from the border area.

The Kurds were U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State since 2014, but Turkey considers the Kurdish fighters terrorists because of their links to outlawed Kurdish rebels fighting inside Turkey since the 1980s.

A mother mourning the death of her infant, lost to malnutrition and malaria. A young boy uses paper currency to weave a makeshift purse, simply because inflation has rendered cash practically worthless. \n     These are some of the scenes witnessed by CBS News' Adriana Diaz and her team as they walked through the streets of Caracas, Venezuela. As Juan Guaidó and Nicolás Maduro continue their  , the people continue to suffer in a crippled economy. They bear the brunt of a deadly socioeconomic spiral that the paralyzed government can't control. On Sunday, thousands of Venezuelans held a vigil for five people killed in protests that were sparked after Guaidó called for   last Tuesday. But the high-level military defections   never materialized, and Diaz described the protests that followed over the weekend as \"lackluster.\" \n  \n  \n\n \n Traveling through Caracas, Diaz documented scenes of people digging through bags of half-eaten garage for their next meal, their only choice considering the exorbitant cost of food. With inflation at more than  , money is basically worthless. One boy showed CBS News how he folds and weaves paper bills to build a makeshift purse, explaining that money is more valuable to weave than to spend. \n\n           Perhaps most affecting are the scenes of families wracked by poverty and death. The child mortality rate in Venezuela has increased 140 percent, compared to 2008 levels. Diaz spoke with Nairobi Sortaga, whose infant son died in February from malnutrition and meningitis, weighing only 13 pounds at 1-year-old. Inside her impoverished home, an empty cupboard contained a small bag of lentils to feed Sortaga and her two daughters. \"It's not my fault,\" she said, wiping away tears. Before the country's crisis, Sortaga worked as a cleaner in Venezuela's Supreme Court building. Now she can't find a job in the collapsed economy. The government provides subsidized food boxes irregularly. \n     She said they're surviving thanks to free meals provided by  . The 3-year-old organization provides a meal a day to 10,000 children in community kitchens across Caracas. Instead of handouts, they provide ingredients and pots to community members, who then run the kitchens on their own. We saw dozens of children with bowls in hand lining up outside one kitchen that was based in a woman's own home. \n\n    \n           Two children who receive the meals are Nairovis Ortega's daughters. Ortega now works in one of the community kitchens. After losing her son in the humanitarian crisis, she wants to fight child malnutrition however she can — even one meal at a time.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/21/de800125-5f91-49ff-be2b-0a0d7f46d222/thumbnail/80x80/5da1d3f5b39c41b0fbfc73ba075e6273/adriana-diaz-promo.jpg#\" alt=\"adriana-diaz-promo.jpg \" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/21/de800125-5f91-49ff-be2b-0a0d7f46d222/thumbnail/80x80/5da1d3f5b39c41b0fbfc73ba075e6273/adriana-diaz-promo.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/21/de800125-5f91-49ff-be2b-0a0d7f46d222/thumbnail/160x160/88a11014eddc865b6c0ec3194660a024/adriana-diaz-promo.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2080%2080'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 103959", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.

As per the University of Warwick research, the atmosphere of the planet, Kepler-438b, is thought to have been stripped away as a result of radiation emitted from a superflaring Red Dwarf star, Kepler-438. Regularly occurring every few hundred days, the superflares are approximately ten times more powerful than those ever recorded on the Sun and equivalent to the same energy as 100 billion megatons of TNT. While superflares themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on Kepler-438b's atmosphere, a dangerous phenomenon associated with powerful flares, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has the potential to strip away any atmosphere and render it uninhabitable. The planet Kepler-438b, to date the exoplanet with the highest recorded Earth Similarity Index, is both similar in size and temperature to the Earth but is in closer proximity to the Red Dwarf than the Earth is to the Sun. Lead researcher David Armstrong explained that if the planet, Kepler-438b, has a magnetic field like the Earth, it may be shielded from some of the effects, but if it does not, or the flares are strong enough, it could have lost its atmosphere, be irradiated by extra dangerous radiation and be a much harsher place for life to exist.

The convictions of Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, had drawn condemnation from rights groups, Western governments and press associations, and the two journalists had garnered several awards and other honors.  \n     In April, they shared with their Reuters colleagues the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting, one of journalism's highest honors. The two were freed after President Win Myint issued a blanket pardon for 6,520 prisoners, said Zaw Zaw, chief of Insein Prison in the country's largest city, Yangon. \n  \n  \n\n \n Myanmar's Supreme Court on April 23 had   of their seven-year prison terms. Their convictions were related to reporting on security forces' abuses of the Muslim Rohingya minority. The reporters contended they were framed because of official displeasure over their reporting. \"I want to say that I am very happy today,\" Wa Lone said to reporters who had gathered in front of the prison. \"I want to thank our friends and families who were trying for our freedom and also to those from all over the world who sympathized with us.\" \"I am really excited to see my family and colleges. I can't wait to go to my newsroom,\" he said. Reuters colleagues drove them away to be reunited with their wives and children. \n\n    \n           Their wives sent the government a letter in pleading for a pardon, Reuters reported, \"not, they said, because their husbands had done anything wrong, but because it would allow them to be released from prison and reunited with their families.\" \n     Myanmar's military launched a   in the western state of Rakhine in 2017, driving more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. U.N. officials and others charge the campaign amounted to ethnic cleansing, and even genocide. The military has said its actions in Rakhine state were a response to attacks by Rohingya guerrillas, and it did not have a policy violating human rights or the laws of war. The Reuters reporters had worked on an investigation of the killings of 10 Rohingya villagers in Inn Din village, for which the government last year said seven soldiers were sentenced to up 10 years in prison with hard labor. \n\n           The two reporters were arrested in December 2017 and sentenced last September after being accused of illegally possessing official documents, a violation of the colonial-era Official Secrets Act. \"We are enormously pleased that Myanmar has released our courageous reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo,\" said a statement issued by Reuters Editor in Chief Stephen Adler. \"Since their arrests 511 days ago, they have become symbols of the importance of press freedom around the world. We welcome their return.\" The U.S. Embassy also welcomed the news, according to Reuters. The case drew attention not only as a media freedom issue but also as an example of how democratic reforms in long-isolated Myanmar have stalled under Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government, which took power in 2016. \n     The military maintains control of key ministries, including those handling security, but Suu Kyi wields executive power and her stance on the Rohingya crisis has disappointed many admirers and dampened hopes for greater democracy in the country. \n\n           The United Nations office in Myanmar said it welcomed the journalists' release. \"The U.N. in Myanmar considers the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo a step toward improving the freedom of the press and a sign of Government's commitment to Myanmar's transition to democracy,\" it said in an emailed statement. The attorney for the two men, Amal Clooney, issued a statement saying that, Since taking on this case over a year ago, I have witnessed incredible determination by Reuters, in particular editor-in-chief Steve Adler and Chief Counsel Gail Gove, in their pursuit of justice for their brave reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. It is inspiring to see a news organization so committed to the protection of innocent men and the profession of journalism. It has been an honour to represent Reuters and the two journalists in this case and I hope that their release signals a renewed commitment to press freedom in Myanmar.\" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch, also applauded the release, but noted Myanmar is prosecuting other bloggers and journalists for their reporting on the military and the government. \"Myanmar's faltering respect for media freedom indicates the dire situation facing human rights and democracy as the country moves toward national   in 2020,\" he said in an emailed statement. Family members of the two reporters were elated. \n     Chit Su Win, the wife of Kyaw Soe Oo, said just before their reunion that she doesn't know how to express her feelings, but \"Now the three of us can hug each other and we are so happy for that.\" Maung Saung Kha, director of \"Athan\"- Freedom of Expression Movement from Myanmar - said he still has concerns about freedom of expression in Myanmar, because there are still trials of journalists. The online magazine The Irrawaddy and other media outlets have been sued by the army for their coverage of recent fighting between the government and the Arakan Army ethnic rebel group, which also operates in Rakhine state.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/44b86e8d-aca3-45fc-9d4c-09f9bac37986/thumbnail/620x420/36281675b64d17352b16aaab8f39dd4a/2019-05-07t044940z-1530359020-rc1a801595a0-rtrmadp-3-myanmar-journalists.jpg#\" alt=\"Reuters reporter Wa Lone poses with wife Pan Ei Mon and daughter, along with Reuters reporter Kyaw Soe Oo carrying his daughter next to wife Chit Su Win, after being freed from prison, after receiving a presidential pardon in Yangon \" height=\"420\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/44b86e8d-aca3-45fc-9d4c-09f9bac37986/thumbnail/620x420/36281675b64d17352b16aaab8f39dd4a/2019-05-07t044940z-1530359020-rc1a801595a0-rtrmadp-3-myanmar-journalists.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/07/44b86e8d-aca3-45fc-9d4c-09f9bac37986/thumbnail/1240x840/8600821b7d95737e227904b9daf0db51/2019-05-07t044940z-1530359020-rc1a801595a0-rtrmadp-3-myanmar-journalists.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20420'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104000", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Species loss is accelerating to a rate tens or hundreds of times faster than in the past, the report said. More than half a million species on land \"have insufficient habitat for long-term survival\" and are likely to go extinct, many within decades, unless their habitats are restored. The oceans are not any better off. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"Humanity unwittingly is attempting to throttle the living planet and humanity's own future,\" said George Mason University biologist Thomas Lovejoy, who has been called the godfather of biodiversity for his research.

This, however cannot be considered a mass extinction. This is just a loss of species at an unprecedented rate due to human intervention,\" she said. \"The drivers of this species loss and ecosystem loss is our extreme changes in the use of the land and the oceans.\"  \n\n           Conservation scientists from around the world convened in Paris to issue the report, which exceeded 1,000 pages. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) included more than 450 researchers who used 15,000 scientific and government reports. The report's summary had to be approved by representatives of all 109 nations. \n     Some nations hit harder by the losses, like small island countries, wanted more in the report. Others, such as the United States, were cautious in the language they sought, but they agreed \"we're in trouble,\" said Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist for the World Wildlife Fund, who observed the final negotiations. \"This is the strongest call we've seen for reversing the trends on the loss of nature,\" Shaw said. The findings are not just about saving plants and animals, but about preserving a world that's becoming harder for humans to live in, said Robert Watson, a former top NASA and British scientist who headed the report. \"We are indeed threatening the potential food security, water security, human health and social fabric\" of humanity, Watson told The Associated Press. It's also an economic and security issue as countries fight over scarcer resources. Watson said the poor in less developed countries bear the greatest burden. \n\n    \n           The report's 39-page summary highlighted five ways people are reducing biodiversity: Overfishing the world's oceans. A third of the world's fish stocks are overfished. \"The key to remember is, it's not a terminal diagnosis,\" said report co-author Andrew Purvis of the Natural History Museum in London. \n     Marine biologist Jon Witman from Brown University, who travels to the Galápagos Islands regularly to monitor the effects of climate change on local species, spoke about the threat in the recent CBSN Originals documentary,  \"There's no doubt we are in an unprecedented period of global stress in terms of climate impacts. And basically  the natural world is being hit by what I call the big three. Certainly climate change is up there. Habitat destruction by humans is absolutely key. And we're also adding pollution to the ecosystem. It sounds pretty grim, and it is grim,\" Whitman said. Professor Miloslavich told CBS News that what's happening in the world today is different than the natural process that led some species to go extinct in past eras. \"It's true there have been extinctions in the past, that nature has taken its course, it's just that these have been processes that have taken millions of years and nature has had the time to adapt and provide a response,\" she said. \"We are not giving nature a time to provide a response.\" \n\n           Fighting climate change and saving species are equally important, the report said, and working on both environmental problems should go hand in hand. Both problems exacerbate each other because a warmer world means fewer species, and a less biodiverse world means fewer trees and plants to remove heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the air, Lovejoy said. — Turning forests, grasslands and other areas into farms, cities and other developments. The habitat loss leaves plants and animals homeless. About three-quarters of Earth's land, two-thirds of its oceans and 85 percent of crucial wetlands have been severely altered or lost, making it harder for species to survive, the report said. The world's   are a perfect example of where climate change and species loss intersect. If the world warms another 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius), which other reports say is likely, coral reefs will probably dwindle by 70 percent to 90 percent, the report said. At 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius), the report said, 99% of the world's coral will be in trouble. \n     \"Business as usual is a disaster,\" Watson said. \n    \n           At least 680 species with backbones have already gone extinct since 1600. The report said 559 domesticated breeds of mammals used for food have disappeared. More than 40% of the world's amphibian species, more than one-third of the marine mammals and nearly one-third of sharks and fish are threatened with extinction. The report relies heavily on research by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, which is composed of biologists who maintain a list of threatened species. The IUCN calculated in March that 27,159 species are threatened, endangered or extinct in the wild out of nearly 100,000 species biologists examined in depth. That includes 1,223 mammal species, 1,492 bird species and 2,341 fish species. Nearly half the threatened species are plants. Scientists have only examined a small fraction of the estimated 8 million species on Earth. The report comes up with 1 million species in trouble by extrapolating the IUCN's 25 percent threatened rate to the rest of the world's species and using a lower rate for the estimated 5.5 million species of insects, Watson said. Outside scientists, such as Lovejoy and others, said that's a reasonable assessment. \n     The report gives only a generic \"within decades\" time frame for species loss because it is dependent on many variables, including taking the problem seriously, which can reduce the severity of the projections, Watson said. \"We're in the middle of the sixth great extinction crisis, but it's happening in slow motion,\" said Conservation International and University of California Santa Barbara ecologist Lee Hannah, who was not part of the report. Five times in the past,   where much of life on the planet blinked out, like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Watson said the report was careful not to call what's going on now as a sixth big die-off because current levels don't come close to the 75% level in past mass extinctions. \n\n    \n           The report goes beyond species. Of the 18 measured ways nature helps humans, the report said 14 are declining, with food and energy production noticeable exceptions. The report found downward trends in nature's ability to provide clean air and water, good soil and other essentials. Habitat loss is one of the biggest threats, and it's happening worldwide, Watson said. The report projects 15.5 million miles (25 million kilometers) of new roads will be paved over nature between now and 2050, most in the developing world. Many of the worst effects can be prevented by changing the way we grow food, produce energy, deal with climate change and dispose of waste, the report said. That involves concerted action by governments, companies and people. Individuals can help with simple changes to the way they eat and use energy, said the co-chairman of the report, ecological scientist Josef Settele of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany. That doesn't mean becoming a vegetarian or vegan, but balancing meat, vegetables and fruit, and walking and biking more, Watson said. \n     \"We can actually feed all the coming billions of people without destroying another inch of nature,\" Lovejoy said. Much of that can be done by eliminating food waste and being more efficient, he said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/09/e151b203-86ea-432e-a21e-6adc9063d8dc/thumbnail/620x451/dce0a313bedcaee7719218c159484fd1/hawaiian-monk-seal-promo.jpg#\" alt=\"hawaiian-monk-seal-promo.jpg \" height=\"451\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/09/e151b203-86ea-432e-a21e-6adc9063d8dc/thumbnail/620x451/dce0a313bedcaee7719218c159484fd1/hawaiian-monk-seal-promo.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/12/09/e151b203-86ea-432e-a21e-6adc9063d8dc/thumbnail/1240x902/66d77ea89fca45dabfc696b2bf9c4e4c/hawaiian-monk-seal-promo.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20451'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

After approving Anirudh Singh as chief coach of the Hyderabad senior team four days ago, the HCA did a volte face on Saturday. While announcing the 20-member squad for the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tourney, they named Zakir Hussain as chief coach of the team instead. Both president Mohd Azharuddin and secretary R Vijayanand were not available for comments on the sudden change. No reasons were given by the association on this sudden development. For Anirudh, who is considered a sincere coach, this is yet another blow. He was removed as Under-19 coach last season for reasons best known to the association. Meanwhile, joint secretary Naresh Sharma has strongly objected to the change of chief coach. “We all had agreed for Anirudh Singh as chief coach but the sudden change has surprised me. It gives a wrong signal,” he said. Tanmay Agarwal, despite a poor show as a captain in Ranji Trophy last season, will continue to lead the team while B Sandeep will be his deputy. \nAccording to the secretary’s statement, the team has been asked to meet in the Green Park hotel on Sunday. : Tanmay Agarwal (Captain), Tilak Varma, Abhirath Reddy, Himalay Agarwal, B Sandeep (Vice Captain), Buddhi Rahul, Sai Pragnay Reddy, Kolla Sumanth, CV Milind, T Ravi Teja, Ajay Dev Goud, Yudveer Singh, Tanay Tyagarajan, Mickil Jaiswal, Hitesh Yadav, Rakesh Yadav, Prateek Reddy, Rakshann Readi, Karthikeya Kak, MSR Charan; Stand Byes: Ashish Srivastav, Akash Bhandari, Shreyas Vala, Samhith Reddy; Coach: Zakir Hussain; Asst Coach: Shashank Nag; Physio: Bheeshm Pratap Singh; Trainer: Rajamani; Video Analyst: Sailesh Kumar; \nMassuier: Sajjed Hussain; Manager: Chitti Sridhar.hitti Sridhar.

The gunbattle Thursday paralyzed the capital of Mexico’s Sinaloa state and left the streets littered with burning vehicles. Five attackers, a member of the National Guard, a civilian and a prisoner were killed, Mexican Defense Secretary Luís Cresencio Sandoval said. Sinaloa Public Security Secretary Cristóbal Castañeda said earlier that 21 people were wounded and that 27 inmates escaped from a prison. Sandoval said the forces were on an operation to arrest Ovidio Guzmán López, a son of the convicted Sinaloa cartel boss. The younger Guzman was wanted for extradition to the U.S. That sequence of events clashed with an initial account by federal Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo, who said 30 members of the National Guard and army were on patrol in Culiacan when they were fired on from a house and found the younger Guzmán inside. Heavily armed gunmen in greater force then surrounded the house, and authorities decided to suspend the operation, Durazo said. Durazo told Televisa that security forces had entered the house but left without Guzman. “With the goal of safeguarding the well-being and tranquility of Culiacan society, officials in the security cabinet decided to suspend the actions,” Durazo said. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he supported the decision to pull back. “The capture of one criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people,” López Obrador said, calling the response to the operation “very violent” and saying many lives were put at risk. “This decision was made to protect citizens. … You cannot fight fire with fire,” he added. “We do not want deaths. We do not want war.” José Luis González Meza, a lawyer for El Chapo’s family, told The Associated Press that Guzmán’s family reported “Ovidio is alive and free” but that he had no more details. The elder Guzman   in the U.S. after being convicted last February of industrial-scale drug trafficking. Ovidio is not one of the drug lord’s best-known sons. Iván Archivaldo Guzmán and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán are known as “Los Chapitos,” or “the little Chapos,” and are believed to be running their father’s cartel, together with Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. But Ovidio Guzmán was indicted in 2018 in Washington, along with a fourth brother, on charges of trafficking in cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. After Ovidio Guzmán was located, Culiacan exploded in violence, with civilians in trucks roaring through the city’s center, shooting what appeared to be .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns. Videos on social media showed a scene resembling a war zone, with gunmen, some in black ski masks, riding in the back of trucks, firing mounted machine guns as vehicles burned. People could be seen running for cover as gunfire rattled around them. Motorists drove in reverse, frantically trying to get away. “Nothing is working,” said Ricardo González, a worker in the state’s congress who shut himself up in his house after picking up his 15-year-old son from school. “There is a psychosis. No one knows what is going on, but everyone is afraid, and they have told us to not come in to work tomorrow.” Castañeda said gunmen blocked streets with burning vehicles to make it difficult for security forces to maneuver. Authorities warned people to avoid going out in parts of city. Sinaloa’s soccer club Dorados canceled its game Thursday, and schools suspended classes.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The next wave of growth could come from increasing exports to large and traditionally under penetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Latin America, which would help the industry meet its aspiration of becoming the world's largest supplier by volume, according to pharma industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). Experts said improved access to medicines in India and exploring new markets while maintaining thrust in the US will help the country's pharma industry to record double-digit growth in the coming year. However, the sector, specially pharmaceuticals, will be up against headwinds of increased costs related to regulatory compliances, particularly for the US market, price controls across markets and mandatory genericisation in India. \"The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is a sunrise industry with a competitive advantage for India. We should leverage India's position by unleashing entrepreneurial spirit through policy stability and ecosystem,\" IPA Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said. The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily. Medical devices makers' body, AdvaMed Vice President Abby Pratt said it would urge the government to promote the adoption of global harmonisation, including internationally recognised standards, that would not only help ensure the quality and efficacy of products but also enable an ecosystem for manufacturing, research, and innovation for benefits of patients in India.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104001", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The event -- streamed on HBO Max (HBO is a sister company of CNN under the ownership of WarnerMedia) -- was a generous donation of time and the precious commodity of celebrity.

(Of course, even when he didn't have it \"together,\" he was still my biggest champion.) David was thriving as a personal trainer at a gym. He loved being a dad and absolutely adored his little girl. Although they weren't living together at the time, he would text me most days with photos and videos of my niece.

At that point in time, David was on the cusp of a promotion at work -- unless the coronavirus really hurt business, he cautioned our father. His promotion never happened. And neither did my promise to visit him and my niece in March. Instead came the pandemic, and with it, a perfect storm for relapse. In the six days after David texted me, everything keeping him on track and on the path of treatment was gone. When California's stay-at-home order took effect  , David was suddenly out of work, unable to visit his daughter, and without a support network.  We worried about him. David plus free time was historically a recipe for disaster. I should have checked in.

I should have known something was wrong. On the phone with our father an hour or so before we learned of my brother's death, our dad said to me, \"I'm worried about David. I don't know what kind of trouble he's going to get into now that he's not working and can't see his daughter. I think he's been sleeping all day.\" He sounded worried. David wasn't returning his calls that day. That night, I received a Facebook message from David's landlord asking me to give him a call.

None of the nearly 1,900 planets previously discovered and confirmed outside our Solar System (called exoplanets) are in the process of formation. A star known as LkCa 15, located 450 light years from Earth, has been observed exhibiting all the trappings of an expectant parent: it is surrounded by a vast disc of dust and gas, making an ideal environment for planets to grow from; the dust shows distinct signs of disturbance - something within has eaten away part of the disc.

Elephants tend to have smaller sperm than mice because the larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length, a new study suggests. In the animal world, if several males mate with the same female, their sperm compete to fertilise her limited supply of eggs. Longer sperm often seem to have a competitive advantage.  However, the study conducted by researchers from the Universities of Zurich and Stockholm now shows that the size of the animals also matters. The larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length. That is why elephants have smaller sperm than mice, researchers said. Stefan Lupold from the University of Zurich and his colleague John Fitzpatrick from University of Stockholm compared the influence of sperm competition on the evolution of sperm in 100 mammalian species.  Unlike previous studies, however, they did not just consider sperm length, but also the number of sperm per ejaculate, which is important as the resources available for sperm production need to be shared between sperm size and number. In other words, the longer every individual sperm, the fewer of them a testicle of a certain size can produce. Earlier studies suggested that the number of sperm might be just as important as sperm length, if not even more so.  After all, the more sperm a male fields against his competitors, the greater the likelihood that one of them will win. Based on their joint consideration of sperm size and number, and with the aid of new meta-analytical methods, the researchers now show that species facing intense sperm competition invest more in their ejaculates on average than their monogamous counterparts. Moreover, they discovered that whether the length or the number of sperm is more important actually depends on the size of the animals.  The bigger the animal, the greater the selection pressure on the overall investments in ejaculates and the more important the number of sperm becomes compared to sperm length. This is due to the more voluminous female reproductive tract, in which the sperm tend to get lost or become \"diluted.\"  In larger species, sperm length or speed probably comes into effect only if a sufficient number of sperm manage to get near the egg, researchers said. In smaller species, however, the distance for sperm to cover is shorter and the risk of loss much smaller, allowing the advantage of longer sperm to manifest itself. As a result, you tend to find the most complex sperm forms in small species, not in large ones. For instance, small fruit flies have the longest sperm ever described, not whales, whose sperm are less than a tenth of a millimetre long and almost a thousand times shorter than those of the flies.

Before that he criticized former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama multiple times, yet none of them are on the ballot.   In fact, Trump seemed to be running against his perceived enemies, not his actual opponent. He spent much of the first half hour attacking the media, although, ironically, he said his source on voter fraud is the newspapers. Looking at my absentee ballot, I don't see any of them on it.

But it's not too late to fix the problem, according to the United Nations' first   on biodiversity. \n     \"We have reconfigured dramatically life on the planet,\" report co-chairman Eduardo Brondizio of Indiana University said at a press conference. Species loss is accelerating to a rate tens or hundreds of times faster than in the past, the report said. More than half a million species on land \"have insufficient habitat for long-term survival\" and are likely to go extinct, many within decades, unless their habitats are restored. The oceans are not any better off. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"Humanity unwittingly is attempting to throttle the living planet and humanity's own future,\" said George Mason University biologist Thomas Lovejoy, who has been called the godfather of biodiversity for his research. He was not part of the report. \"The biological diversity of this planet has been really hammered, and this is really our last chance to address all of that,\" Lovejoy said. \n\n           Patricia Miloslavich, a contributor to the report and senior professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at Universidad Simón Bolívar, spoke with \" \" on Monday about the conclusions. \"We have seen in the past that history has taught us there have been mass extinctions. This, however cannot be considered a mass extinction. This is just a loss of species at an unprecedented rate due to human intervention,\" she said. \"The drivers of this species loss and ecosystem loss is our extreme changes in the use of the land and the oceans.\"  \n\n           Conservation scientists from around the world convened in Paris to issue the report, which exceeded 1,000 pages. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) included more than 450 researchers who used 15,000 scientific and government reports. The report's summary had to be approved by representatives of all 109 nations. \n     Some nations hit harder by the losses, like small island countries, wanted more in the report. Others, such as the United States, were cautious in the language they sought, but they agreed \"we're in trouble,\" said Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist for the World Wildlife Fund, who observed the final negotiations. \"This is the strongest call we've seen for reversing the trends on the loss of nature,\" Shaw said. The findings are not just about saving plants and animals, but about preserving a world that's becoming harder for humans to live in, said Robert Watson, a former top NASA and British scientist who headed the report. \"We are indeed threatening the potential food security, water security, human health and social fabric\" of humanity, Watson told The Associated Press. It's also an economic and security issue as countries fight over scarcer resources. Watson said the poor in less developed countries bear the greatest burden. \n\n    \n           The report's 39-page summary highlighted five ways people are reducing biodiversity: Overfishing the world's oceans. A third of the world's fish stocks are overfished. \"The key to remember is, it's not a terminal diagnosis,\" said report co-author Andrew Purvis of the Natural History Museum in London. \n     Marine biologist Jon Witman from Brown University, who travels to the Galápagos Islands regularly to monitor the effects of climate change on local species, spoke about the threat in the recent CBSN Originals documentary,  \"There's no doubt we are in an unprecedented period of global stress in terms of climate impacts. And basically  the natural world is being hit by what I call the big three. Certainly climate change is up there. Habitat destruction by humans is absolutely key. And we're also adding pollution to the ecosystem. It sounds pretty grim, and it is grim,\" Whitman said. Professor Miloslavich told CBS News that what's happening in the world today is different than the natural process that led some species to go extinct in past eras. \"It's true there have been extinctions in the past, that nature has taken its course, it's just that these have been processes that have taken millions of years and nature has had the time to adapt and provide a response,\" she said. \"We are not giving nature a time to provide a response.\" \n\n           Fighting climate change and saving species are equally important, the report said, and working on both environmental problems should go hand in hand. Both problems exacerbate each other because a warmer world means fewer species, and a less biodiverse world means fewer trees and plants to remove heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the air, Lovejoy said. — Turning forests, grasslands and other areas into farms, cities and other developments. The habitat loss leaves plants and animals homeless. About three-quarters of Earth's land, two-thirds of its oceans and 85 percent of crucial wetlands have been severely altered or lost, making it harder for species to survive, the report said. The world's   are a perfect example of where climate change and species loss intersect. If the world warms another 0.9 degrees (0.5 degrees Celsius), which other reports say is likely, coral reefs will probably dwindle by 70 percent to 90 percent, the report said. At 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius), the report said, 99% of the world's coral will be in trouble. \n     \"Business as usual is a disaster,\" Watson said. \n    \n           At least 680 species with backbones have already gone extinct since 1600. The report said 559 domesticated breeds of mammals used for food have disappeared. More than 40% of the world's amphibian species, more than one-third of the marine mammals and nearly one-third of sharks and fish are threatened with extinction. The report relies heavily on research by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, which is composed of biologists who maintain a list of threatened species. The IUCN calculated in March that 27,159 species are threatened, endangered or extinct in the wild out of nearly 100,000 species biologists examined in depth. That includes 1,223 mammal species, 1,492 bird species and 2,341 fish species. Nearly half the threatened species are plants. Scientists have only examined a small fraction of the estimated 8 million species on Earth. The report comes up with 1 million species in trouble by extrapolating the IUCN's 25 percent threatened rate to the rest of the world's species and using a lower rate for the estimated 5.5 million species of insects, Watson said. Outside scientists, such as Lovejoy and others, said that's a reasonable assessment. \n     The report gives only a generic \"within decades\" time frame for species loss because it is dependent on many variables, including taking the problem seriously, which can reduce the severity of the projections, Watson said. \"We're in the middle of the sixth great extinction crisis, but it's happening in slow motion,\" said Conservation International and University of California Santa Barbara ecologist Lee Hannah, who was not part of the report. Five times in the past,   where much of life on the planet blinked out, like the one that killed the dinosaurs. Watson said the report was careful not to call what's going on now as a sixth big die-off because current levels don't come close to the 75% level in past mass extinctions. \n\n    \n           The report goes beyond species. Of the 18 measured ways nature helps humans, the report said 14 are declining, with food and energy production noticeable exceptions. The report found downward trends in nature's ability to provide clean air and water, good soil and other essentials. Habitat loss is one of the biggest threats, and it's happening worldwide, Watson said. The report projects 15.5 million miles (25 million kilometers) of new roads will be paved over nature between now and 2050, most in the developing world. Many of the worst effects can be prevented by changing the way we grow food, produce energy, deal with climate change and dispose of waste, the report said. That involves concerted action by governments, companies and people. Individuals can help with simple changes to the way they eat and use energy, said the co-chairman of the report, ecological scientist Josef Settele of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research in Germany. That doesn't mean becoming a vegetarian or vegan, but balancing meat, vegetables and fruit, and walking and biking more, Watson said. \n     \"We can actually feed all the coming billions of people without destroying another inch of nature,\" Lovejoy said.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the recent passing away of Siraj’s father, the celebrations were muted and confined to indoors. But the family members of the fast bowler, who made his Test debut against Australia on Saturday, were excited while they followed the game on the television. The moment Siraj took to the field with his teammates, his mother Shabana Begum’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. Speaking after watching his son don Indian colours, she said her husband’s (Mohammed Ghouse) dream finally fulfilled. “  (It is all the grace of Almighty). Thanks to God, his father would be proud of him today,” she said. When asked about their feeling ahead of his debut, she said, “We got up very early to watch him play. We were excited and happy. But when he took the field and stood there with his teammates singing the national anthem, it brought us tears.” Siraj had a wonderful debut picking up two crucial wickets that helped India skittle out Australia for 195 runs on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. When asked about their feeling after Siraj picked up his first wicket, Shabana said, “We can’t express the feeling. Playing for country has always been his and his father’s dream. Now he made the country proud.” Shabana, who was worried for Siraj for neglecting his studies and focusing on cricket, added she wants her son to win matches for India. Siraj’s grandmother Sardar Bhi said that the family was delighted. “Due to his father’s death, the family mourning will continue for three months. So we told Siraj’s friends not to come to the house for watching the match. We know they are all excited to share their joy with us. But this is a tough time.” “We started getting calls early in the morning when he took those two wickets. We switched off our mobiles and kept it aside to watch the match,” she added. Siraj’s brother Mohammed Ismail said he was over the moon. “I wasn’t feeling well in the morning, so I watched till lunch and slept off. But I have been receiving calls from people congratulating us. It is a great moment for our family,” he added. A long time friend of Siraj, Mohd Shafi said that he is poised for greater things. “I am very happy to see Siraj playing for the country. If his father was here, he would have been very happy. I spoke to his mother, she was also very happy. I spoke to Siraj as well after the first day’s game. He said if people support him, he would do many great things for the country. Siraj revealed that it is just the start and he has been working very hard.” Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

Should the calculation not match experimental results, it would be conclusive evidence of new, unknown phenomena that lie outside of the Standard Model--physicists' present understanding of the fundamental particles and the forces between them. The current result does not yet indicate such a difference between experiment and theory, but scientists expect the precision of the calculation to improve dramatically now that they've proven they can tackle the task.

Her skeletal remains provided scientists with invaluable information regarding the human race and its evolution, and Google is celebrating this day with a Doodle. Lucy Australopithecus has been proven to have lived around 3.2 million years ago in Ehtiopia. The Google Doodle dedicated to her today shows three stages of Lucy's evolution. Currently, Lucy's bones are kept in a museum in Ethiopia. Here's more about our ancestor Lucy: 1) 'Lucy' was the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton ever found. Australopithecus afarensis is a species that shares both human and ape characteristics that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. Around 40 per cent of Lucy's remains were discovered intact. 2) Do you know who named her Lucy? Paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson named the fossils Lucy after the Beatles song ' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.' 3) Lucy is a crucial stepping stone between apes and Homo Sapiens. It was exactly 41 years ago from today when the oldest known example of a bipedal primate came into the knowledge of humans. 4) Lucy had numerous similarities with chimpanzees.The skeleton revealed that she mostly walked upright. Bipedalism, walking using two rear limbs or legs, is a key distinction between Homo Sapiens and chimpanzees. 5) According to  , with a mixture of ape and human features - including long dangling arms with pelvic, spine, foot, and leg bones suited to walking upright - slender Lucy stood three-and-a-half feet tall. 6) Lucy is determined as a female due to her size. Fossils that were discovered later were larger in size and were identified as males. 7) Lucy was fully grown, for her wisdom teeth were very human-like.

The gunbattle Thursday paralyzed the capital of Mexico’s Sinaloa state and left the streets littered with burning vehicles. Five attackers, a member of the National Guard, a civilian and a prisoner were killed, Mexican Defense Secretary Luís Cresencio Sandoval said. Sinaloa Public Security Secretary Cristóbal Castañeda said earlier that 21 people were wounded and that 27 inmates escaped from a prison. Sandoval said the forces were on an operation to arrest Ovidio Guzmán López, a son of the convicted Sinaloa cartel boss. The younger Guzman was wanted for extradition to the U.S. That sequence of events clashed with an initial account by federal Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo, who said 30 members of the National Guard and army were on patrol in Culiacan when they were fired on from a house and found the younger Guzmán inside. Heavily armed gunmen in greater force then surrounded the house, and authorities decided to suspend the operation, Durazo said. Durazo told Televisa that security forces had entered the house but left without Guzman. “With the goal of safeguarding the well-being and tranquility of Culiacan society, officials in the security cabinet decided to suspend the actions,” Durazo said. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he supported the decision to pull back. “The capture of one criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people,” López Obrador said, calling the response to the operation “very violent” and saying many lives were put at risk. “This decision was made to protect citizens. … You cannot fight fire with fire,” he added. “We do not want deaths. We do not want war.” José Luis González Meza, a lawyer for El Chapo’s family, told The Associated Press that Guzmán’s family reported “Ovidio is alive and free” but that he had no more details. The elder Guzman   in the U.S. after being convicted last February of industrial-scale drug trafficking. Ovidio is not one of the drug lord’s best-known sons. Iván Archivaldo Guzmán and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán are known as “Los Chapitos,” or “the little Chapos,” and are believed to be running their father’s cartel, together with Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. But Ovidio Guzmán was indicted in 2018 in Washington, along with a fourth brother, on charges of trafficking in cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana. After Ovidio Guzmán was located, Culiacan exploded in violence, with civilians in trucks roaring through the city’s center, shooting what appeared to be .50-caliber sniper rifles and machine guns. Videos on social media showed a scene resembling a war zone, with gunmen, some in black ski masks, riding in the back of trucks, firing mounted machine guns as vehicles burned. People could be seen running for cover as gunfire rattled around them. Motorists drove in reverse, frantically trying to get away. “Nothing is working,” said Ricardo González, a worker in the state’s congress who shut himself up in his house after picking up his 15-year-old son from school. “There is a psychosis. No one knows what is going on, but everyone is afraid, and they have told us to not come in to work tomorrow.” Castañeda said gunmen blocked streets with burning vehicles to make it difficult for security forces to maneuver. Authorities warned people to avoid going out in parts of city.

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route. A clarification on the non-applicability of the new FDI measure would be critical for them to continue making massive investments in India,\" it added.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104002", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104002", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The next wave of growth could come from increasing exports to large and traditionally under penetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Latin America, which would help the industry meet its aspiration of becoming the world's largest supplier by volume, according to pharma industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). Experts said improved access to medicines in India and exploring new markets while maintaining thrust in the US will help the country's pharma industry to record double-digit growth in the coming year. However, the sector, specially pharmaceuticals, will be up against headwinds of increased costs related to regulatory compliances, particularly for the US market, price controls across markets and mandatory genericisation in India. \"The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is a sunrise industry with a competitive advantage for India. We should leverage India's position by unleashing entrepreneurial spirit through policy stability and ecosystem,\" IPA Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said. The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily. Medical devices makers' body, AdvaMed Vice President Abby Pratt said it would urge the government to promote the adoption of global harmonisation, including internationally recognised standards, that would not only help ensure the quality and efficacy of products but also enable an ecosystem for manufacturing, research, and innovation for benefits of patients in India.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104008", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

He currently sits on the national board of the Voluntad Popular political party, and is a member of the transitional government for Juan Guaidó, president of the National Assembly. If and when Guaidó takes control of the country from President Nicolás Maduro, Goicoechea will be tasked with overseeing the energy department in a new government. \n     Goicoechea is a 34-year-old attorney with a law degree from Columbia University. He is the recipient of the   Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty by the Cato Institute. His work with Guaidó goes back at least 15 years, when the two were student activists who opposed Hugo Chavez's government. Guaidó has been recognized by   and other countries as the rightful legitimate president of Venezuela.   Guaidó called upon the Venezuelan people and the army to rise up against Maduro, a call to action that caused chaos and did not lead to a change in the government. \n  \n  \n\n \n On Saturday, Goicoechea spoke with CBS News correspondent Adriana Diaz. He discussed the opposition's communications with Russia \"on several levels\"; the opposition's ongoing negotiations with the Maduro regime, including an offer of amnesty to defectors; and the possible military intervention by the U.S., which Goicoechea said should be only a last resort. \n\n    \n           DIAZ: Is the opposition speaking to the Russians? GOICOECHEA: Well, at some level, yes, what we have done is to express our will and our commitment to respect their investments in Venezuela, to recognize our debts with the Russians and to invite them to invest and participate in the new Venezuela. It's better for the Russians... DIAZ: Who has made that communication with the Russians? Has Guaidó? \n     GOICOECHEA: At several levels — we have done that at several levels. DIAZ: This week? Recently? GOICOECHEA: Recently, and one year ago and six months ago. It's something tried to do in terms of politics and policy — for us it's important to let them know that we are going to respect international investments in Venezuela. We are fighting for Venezuela which is ruled by the law — which is in international protections of investment because we know this system doesn't work.  So it's even better for Russia to have us in power — that means a democracy that will respect their debts and that we will have the possibility of paying back — this government doesn't have any chance of paying that back. DIAZ: And how are these negotiations going?  GOICOECHEA: In some cases, very well. For the first time in probably two decades we have a fluid conversation with people within the government and those people want to find a way to overcome Maduro and to find a place in the new democracy in Venezuela.  DIAZ: Are these leaders in the government? Are these leaders in the military? Because earlier this week the U.S. said that there were a handful of high level members of the government who were ready to join the opposition, but then the next day we saw them standing next to Maduro showing their loyalty to him.  \n     GOICOECHEA: Well, you know what happens every time in a dictatorship. The only day in which the military shows discontent with the dictatorship is the last day of a dictatorship. I'm not afraid of that. We all know what happened.  GOICOECHEA: [Cuba and Russia] are here. They have a huge intelligence operation right now in Venezuela, they are spying on our military, they are accusing our military.  DIAZ: Do you believe they are influencing the military and influencing Maduro?  GOICOECHEA: They are influencing Maduro, protecting Maduro and spying on our military. The main purpose of these countries here is to collect information, to avoid a coup and that's what they do — but the influence is real, it's important and it's dangerous, dangerous for the Venezuelan people.  DIAZ: The U.S. has said it is committed to seeing transition of power — would you want help from the U.S.?  GOICOECHEA: No one wants an intervention, but I see it may be possible, it may be necessary, an intervention.  No one in Venezuela wants an intervention of any country in our territory. I want a democratic, free, independent Venezuela, a peaceful Venezuela. I don't want war in Venezuela.  \n     And I want to find a political way out for Maduro. If that is possible, that's of course my first option. But what we won't do is stand a dictatorship for 20 more years.  GOICOECHEA: This isn't about an alliance with President Trump — this is an alliance with a very important country in this world, with a very admired country in this world, and with people who believe in freedom. So we kindly — we appreciate that you don't polarize Venezuelan issues in the United States. It's not a matter of supporting Trump or being against Trump: It's about values we have in common with the Western Hemisphere, defending people who are starving and getting mistreated in every way. We do share values with Donald Trump as we do share values with Democrats, as we do share values with the whole of the American people. Be aware the fight for Venezuela should be bipartisan and not even about a political party at all. It's about human values and our human condition that is being violated here in Venezuela.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/aaff7a30-2b84-4dcb-87b7-d47b3ab23969/thumbnail/620x424/9c957cca492891cca79318340bfbe012/yon.jpg#\" alt=\"Venezuela Mayoral Elections \" height=\"424\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/aaff7a30-2b84-4dcb-87b7-d47b3ab23969/thumbnail/620x424/9c957cca492891cca79318340bfbe012/yon.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/aaff7a30-2b84-4dcb-87b7-d47b3ab23969/thumbnail/1240x848/52bd761d594bdff210b87e61f480c9ae/yon.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20424'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104008", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The research could pave the way for many more efficient and greener chemical processes, including the procedure known as carbon capture -trapping carbon dioxide from major sources, for example a fossil-fuel power plant, and storing it to prevent its entry into the atmosphere. \"Materials which contain permanent holes, or pores, are technologically important. They are used for manufacturing a range of products from plastic bottles to petrol,\" said Stuart James of Queen's School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. \"However, until recently, these porous materials have been solids. What we have done is to design a special liquid from the 'bottom-up' -we designed the shapes of the molecules which make up the liquid so that the liquid could not fill up all the space,\" James said. \"Because of the empty holes we then had in the liquid, we found that it was able to dissolve unusually large amounts of gas,\" he said. \"A few more years' research will be needed, but if we can find applications for these porous liquids they could result in new or improved chemical processes,\" James said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104008", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The town of Ras al-Ayn, scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the Turkish invasion, was emerging as an immediate test for   agreed on by Washington and Ankara. Before the deal’s announcement, Turkish-backed forces had encircled the town and were battling fierce resistance from Kurdish fighters inside. A spokesman for the Kurdish-led fighters said Friday they were not withdrawing from Ras al-Ayn because Turkish forces are still besieging and shelling it. Elsewhere along the border, calm seemed to prevail. Shelling hit in and around Ras al-Ayn on Friday morning, raising columns of smoke, seen by an Associated Press journalist in Ceylanpinar on the Turkish side of the border, but none was seen after noon, and only sporadic gunfire was heard from inside the town. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Rojava Information Center said fighting continued into the afternoon as Turkish-backed Syrian fighters clashed with Kurdish forces in villages on the outskirts of Ras al-Ayn. The Kurdish-led force said five of its fighters were killed and a number of civilians wounded in a Turkish airstrike on one of the villages. Other activists reported a new exodus of civilians from the villages. Gun battles and shelling continued around a hospital in the center of Ras al-Ayn, and injured inside could not be evacuated, said Mustafa Bali, spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The Kurdish Red Crescent said it was unable to enter the town to evacuate wounded because of fighting. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied any fighting took place Friday and said Kurdish fighters had begun withdrawing. Bali said that was not true. “The Turkish land and air bombing continue in Ras al-Ayn,” he said. A senior U.S. official said they were awaiting confirmation on the reported fighting. The official said it takes time for information to filter down to field units especially for forces without strong command and control. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. The cease-fire agreement — reached after hours of negotiations in Turkey’s capital between Erdogan and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence — requires the Kurdish fighters to vacate a swath of territory in Syria along the Turkish border. That arrangement would largely solidify the position Turkey has gained after days of fighting. The Turks and the Kurds appear to disagree on the size of the area covered by the cease-fire. Turkey calls it a “pause” not a cease-fire. It remains unclear if the Kurdish-led force was on board with pulling back even if a pause in fighting firmly takes hold. Pence said the U.S. was already coordinating with it on a withdrawal. But American sway with the group has diminished after President Donald Trump turned his back on it by withdrawing U.S. soldiers from northeast Syria, opening the way for Turkey to launch its invasion 10 days ago. The Kurdish-led force’s commander, Mazloum Abdi, said Thursday night that it would abide by the cease-fire and “do our best to make it successful.” He did not mention any withdrawal. Asked about a withdrawal, a force spokesman, Mervan, said “so far there is nothing,” pointing to the continuing siege of Ras al-Ayn. “It seems that under this deal they want to commit more massacres,” he said. He uses a nom de guerre in accordance with the group’s regulations. A member of the Syrian Kurdish force ruled out any pull-back from border towns, calling the U.S. deal with Turkey an “insult” and saying “no way this will work.” “They think we will just leave our land and our people to Turks if we are asked,” he said. “They can come and take the land by force. Nobody should expect us to leave our land.” “How does the U.S. think to enforce a deal without presence on the ground?” he added, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. Elsewhere, no fighting was heard Friday along the stretch of the border that has been the main theater of the Turkish assault, running from Ras al-Ayn about 125 kilometers (75 miles) west to the Turkish-held town of Tal Abyad. Kurdish fighters have already been driven out of much, but not all, of that territory. Trump framed the U.S. cease-fire deal with Turkey as   but it aims to patch up a foreign policy crisis widely seen to be of his own making. Turkish troops and their allied Syrian fighters launched the offensive two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing American troops from the border area. The Kurdish-led forces have since  , backed by Russia, to deploy there to protect them from Turkey. Syrian troops have already rolled into several key points along the border. The Kurds were U.S. allies in the fight against the Islamic State since 2014, but Turkey considers the Kurdish fighters terrorists because of their links to outlawed Kurdish rebels fighting inside Turkey since the 1980s. Turkey has said its security depends on clearing them out of a border “safe zone.” Turkey’s pro-government dominated media hailed the cease-fire agreement as a clear win for Erdogan. “Great Victory” read Yeni Safak’s banner headline. “Turkey got everything it wanted.” Sabah newspaper headlined: “We won both on the field and on the (negotiating) table.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104008", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

For Anirudh, who is considered a sincere coach, this is yet another blow. He was removed as Under-19 coach last season for reasons best known to the association.

Miguel Cabrera, an official at the National Ballet of Cuba founded by Alonso, said she died at a hospital in Havana. As founder and director of the National Ballet of Cuba, Alonso personified the island’s arts program under Fidel Castro’s communist rule and she kept vise-like control over the troupe past her 90th birthday despite being nearly blind for decades. In New York in the 1940s and ’50s, Alonso was one of the earliest members of the company that became the American Ballet Theatre, helping it develop into one of the more important ballet troupes in the U.S. She was recognized the world over for the stylized beauty of her choreography and was named prima ballerina assoluta, the rarely bestowed highest honor in dance. The ballet company announced it would dedicate Thursday evening’s performance at Lincoln Center of the George Balanchine classic “Theme and Variations” to Alonso’s memory. Balanchine created the work for ABT and Alonso performed at its world premiere on November 25, 1947, partnered with Igor Youskevitch. Even after she turned 90, Alonso maintained a busy travel schedule, cutting an impressive figure at ballet openings and other cultural events with her regal bearing, dark sunglasses and scarf-wrapped head always held high. But Alonso also drew criticism for her longtime support of Castro’s government. Defecting dancers said they were stifled by extreme discipline, a lack of artistic freedom due to her near-stranglehold over Cuban ballet and the inability to travel freely abroad. Born Alicia Ernestina de la Caridad del Cobre Martinez Hoya on Dec. 21, 1920, in Havana, Alonso began her dance studies in 1931. “I grabbed the barre … and I found what I liked more than anything else in the world,” Alonso told The Associated Press in 2001. At age 16, she moved to the United States, where she married s fellow Cuban dancer and choreographer, Fernando Alonso. During their 27-year marriage, which ended in divorce, the couple had one daughter, Laura. She was Alicia Alonso’s only child. During her early years in the U.S., Alonso continued her studies with well-known ballet teachers such as Enrico Zanfretta and Alexandra Fedorova, both from the School of American Ballet in New York. Alonso launched her professional career in 1938 on Broadway, where she performed in the musical comedies “Great Lady” and “Stars in Your Eyes.” The following year, she was part of the American Ballet Caravan, precursor of the New York City Ballet. Alonso joined the prestigious American Ballet Theatre of New York in 1940 and remained with the company for 16 years. Her career took off as she danced the lead roles as prima ballerina in romantic and classical performances throughout Europe and the Americas. During that time, she worked with some of the 20th century’s greatest choreographers, including George Balanchine, Mikhail Fokine and Bronislava Nijinska. But she worried about the development of new dancers back home and in 1948 founded her own company in Havana, the Ballet Alicia Alonso. She opened an academy of the same name shortly thereafter. During the rule of strongman Fulgencio Batista, Alonso issued a public letter in 1956 rejecting any government assistance for her dance school. She ultimately decided not to dance again in Cuba while Batista remained in power and traveled to the United States, where she worked for a time with the Greek Theatre of Los Angeles. Alonso returned home after the January 1959 triumph of the Cuban Revolution and changed the name of her academy to the National Ballet of Cuba, which received enthusiastic and enduring financial backing from Castro’s government. She remained a fervent, lifelong supporter of the revolution, reportedly even joining other city-dwelling Cubans for backbreaking sugarcane harvest campaigns ordered by Castro. Meanwhile, her company toured Latin America, Europe and the United States, performing in 1978 at the Metropolitan Opera of New York and the Kennedy Center in Washington. In 1960, Alonso organized the first International Ballet Festival of Havana, an event that still brings some of the world’s finest dance troupes to Cuba. The American Ballet Theatre was at the inaugural festival, though the U.S. and Cuba severed relations soon after and it would be four decades before a U.S. dance company performed on the island again, the Washington Ballet in 2000. To Cubans, who can be as fanatical about dance as about baseball, Alonso was simply Alicia — just like with Fidel, no last name was necessary. The state-run Suchel cosmetics company even developed a signature scent in her name. So great was Alonso’s prestige that she was considered untouchable in a country where even the highest-placed have run afoul of the government, and she wielded that power to defend her own. At some point during Cuba’s persecution of homosexuals in the 1960s and early ’70s, Alonso learned authorities were investigating some of her dancers, according to the book “Cuba Confidential” by longtime Cuba watcher Ann Louise Bardach. Alonso personally called Castro’s brother Raul and threatened to leave Cuba if they were harmed. Alonso’s eyesight began to fail early in her career, and she danced many of her famous roles while partially blind, guided on stage by her partner’s placement and by the stage lights. Although ultimately she could see only lights and shadows, she performed into her 70s, before retiring in 1995 after a performance in Italy. Even then she would occasionally put on her dance shoes and practice on stage using the stage-side lights as guides. “Throughout history, I have been the ballerina who has danced the longest on stage,” Alonso told AP. Offstage, she continued to devise choreography, plan tours and even design the company’s performance programs. Over the years Alonso’s schools churned out dancers who were in demand by companies worldwide, prized for their technical perfection. But she also gained a reputation for micromanaging and for imposing total domination of Cuba’s dance world, just as Castro loomed over all things political. Detractors said artistic stagnation set in and the company was slow to pick up new trends, rigidly adhering to classical styles and the ballets that made her famous: “Giselle,” ”Carmen,” ”Swan Lake.” Many dancers fled in search of creative freedom and the chance to earn more money. Star dancer Rolando Sarabia went to the U.S. in 2005, and as recently as 2010 five members of the National Ballet stayed behind in Toronto following a performance. Alonso bemoaned the desertions, emphasizing the free training they received. “It is painful,” Alonso told reporters after five dancers defected during a U.S. tour in 2003. “They have received an education of more than nine years, being taught without cost.” Alonso was known for having a fiery temper and the highest physical standards for her ideal of the tall, elegant, rail-thin ballerina. There were also signs of coolness in her relationship with her daughter, who started her own school and accepted many students who fell short of Alonso’s rigid ideal but went on to considerable achievements. Alsonso was considered a national treasure, getting a standing ovation at Old Havana’s gilded Gran Teatro in 2010 when she made a regal entrance to a tribute on her 90th birthday. A month earlier, her old troupe, the American Ballet Theatre, honored the aging icon when it performed in Havana 50 years after its last visit. Alonso’s lifetime of work brought her Cuba’s highest honors, including an honorary doctorate from the University of Havana in 1973. Fidel Castro’s government granted her the Order of Jose Marti in 2000, and his successor, Raul, gave her the top arts teaching prize in 2010. She also received prestigious awards from Spain, France and UNESCO. Alonso is survived by her husband, art critic Pedro Simón Martínez; her daughter, Laura; a grandson and two great-granddaughters.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104009", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.mydigitalfc.com", "section": "Just In", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.mydigitalfc.com/companies/281219/delhi-sees-more-night-trips-than-bengaluru-mumbai-says-ola.html", "title": "Delhi sees more night trips than Bengaluru, Mumbai, says Ola", "author": "\n                ", "author_link": "", "published_date": "\n                ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Overall, Delhi recorded 71 million trips totalling 1.06 billion km in 2019.", "text": " Delhi recorded seven million trips between 10 PM and 6 AM this year - the highest among Bengaluru, Mumbai and other major cities, as per Ola's latest ridership data.

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route. A clarification on the non-applicability of the new FDI measure would be critical for them to continue making massive investments in India,\" it added.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104008", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Mr. Trump's comments, delivered on Twitter, came as a Chinese delegation was scheduled to resume talks in Washington on Wednesday aimed at resolving a trade war that has shaken financial markets and cast gloom over the world economy. \n     Mr. Trump turned up the heat by saying he would raise import taxes on $200 billion in Chinese products to 25 percent from 10 percent Friday. He'd twice pushed back deadlines — in January and March — to raise the tariffs in a bid to buy more time for a negotiated settlement. But on Sunday, Mr. Trump, who has called himself a \"tariff man,\" said he's losing patience. \"The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!\" Mr. Trump  . \n  \n  \n\n \n In his tweets, Mr. Trump also threatened to slap tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese imports, covering everything China ships annually to the United States. The prospect of higher tariffs and heightened tensions could alarm investors when markets open Monday. \"When the president puts his foot down, it makes the market go down,\" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, wrote in a research note Sunday. \"Tariff man is back just in time to make the stock market dive, dive, dive.\"  U.S. stocks futures were sharply lower overnight, as were Asian stock markets. After the president's tweet, Beijing was said to be mulling the cancellation of a trip to Washington this week by a trade delegation in which it was thought a new trade deal might be reached. \n     The two countries are locked in a high-stakes dispute over China's push to establish itself as a technological super power. The U.S. charges that China is resorting to predatory tactics — including cybertheft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology — in a drive to establish Chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles. \n\n    \n           The administration has repeatedly suggested that the negotiators are making progress. A month ago, Trump said that the two countries were \"rounding the turn\" and predicted that \"something monumental\" would be achieved in the next few weeks. But last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin seemed to temper expectations, suggesting that Washington was willing to \"move on\" if it can't get the deal it wants. A substantive deal would require China to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions, abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies, easing up on the pressure for foreign companies to share trade secrets, and giving them more access to the Chinese market. Philip Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a White House economist under President George W. Bush, said the talks are too complicated for Mr. Trump's high-pressure tactics to work. \"The president treats this like we're haggling over the price of a used car,\" Levy said. Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of China's Global Times, an English-language state paper, sent   on Sunday that criticized Mr. Trump's approach, stating \"he seemingly doesn't understand how tariffs work.\" Mr. Trump has made a priority of shaking up American trade policy.  As a candidate for the presidency, Mr. Trump raged repeatedly about alleged Chinese perfidy — so much so that a video mashup of him spitting out the word \"China\" went viral and collected more than 15 million views on YouTube. \n     Mr. Trump charged that previous administrations, gullible and weak, had let China get away with abusive trade practices, accepting empty promises from Beijing and allowing the U.S.-China economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided. As evidence, he pointed to America's vast U.S. trade deficit with China — $379 billion last year, by far the biggest with any country in the world. Once he took office, Mr. Trump's relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, seemed to get off to a good start. The two men shared chocolate cake and amiable conversation at Trump's resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April 2017. A few weeks later, China agreed to open its market to U.S. beef, cooked chicken, and natural gas in what Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called a \"herculean accomplishment.\" The romance faded. In March 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative issued a report accusing China of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies. Last July, the Trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing into changing its policies. It now has imposed 10 percent  tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and 25 percent tariffs on another $50 billion. The Chinese have retaliated by targeting $110 billion in U.S. imports. The fight between the world's two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy, saying the U.S.-China standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies, build factories and make investments. Mr. Trump has portrayed his tariffs as a moneymaker for the United States and a benefit to the U.S. economy. But a March study by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University, and Princeton University found that the burden of Mr. Trump's tariffs — including taxes on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and Chinese imports — falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses who buy imported products. By the end of last year, the study found, they were paying $3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing $1.4 billion a month in lost efficiency. \n     Nonetheless, the overall U.S. economy has remained healthy. On Friday, the government reported that the U.S. unemployment rate had fallen to the lowest level in half a century.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/04/40b06f67-5f89-4b11-ad7c-02fd40e6c243/thumbnail/620x413g2/9fbcfea081008cbfc1792da33176d052/ap-19094757457123.jpg#\" alt=\"Trump US China \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/04/40b06f67-5f89-4b11-ad7c-02fd40e6c243/thumbnail/620x413g2/9fbcfea081008cbfc1792da33176d052/ap-19094757457123.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/04/40b06f67-5f89-4b11-ad7c-02fd40e6c243/thumbnail/1240x826g2/359b5ffb9c8b45c0ce5acdb39a937bdb/ap-19094757457123.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104008", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Cougar helicopter hurtled into a mountain outside Caracas in the early hours of an overcast day in the capital. An investigation was underway.  \n     The armed forces in a statement said the chopper was heading to San Carlos in Cojedes state. That's near a military academy where Maduro appeared early Saturday to oversee training exercises following a week of intrigue that saw a small group of security forces turn against him in the failed attempt by opposition leader Juan Guaidó to overthrow the government.  On board the helicopter were two lieutenant colonels as well as five lower-ranking officers. The statement didn't say if the chopper was part of the presidential delegation.  \n  \n  \n\n \n Also in Caracas on Saturday, a protester handed over a written appeal for the military's support, but a Venezuelan policeman burned the document and let the ashes fall to the ground.  \n\n           The armed forces \"won't be blackmailed or bought,\" said a second officer standing nearby.  Benito Rodriguez fumed as he watched the events unfold.  \"It's a humiliation,\" said Rodriguez, a demonstrator who had joined a crowd of about 150 protesters gathered near La Casona, a residence historically used by Venezuelan presidents.  \n     The scene highlights the uphill battle now facing opponents of Maduro who have failed to persuade the country's security forces to join efforts to oust the leader.  The critical role of the Venezuelan military in the country's crisis was on display as Maduro tried to portray strength by joining troops at the military academy, while Guaidó attempted to woo the armed forces to his side by urging supporters to the streets.  National television showed Maduro wearing a camouflage hat as he shook hands and exchanged fist bumps with security forces during a visit to a military base before watching troops engage in a shooting exercise.  \"Loyal forever,\" Maduro bellowed to a crowd of cadets in green uniforms.  Guaidó, meanwhile, told backers to go to military garrisons to persuade forces to turn against Maduro, whose years in office have been marked by escalating hardship for most people in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in Latin America.  As demonstrators linked arms and moved toward police, protest leader Maria Suarez urged calm.  \"Please, a lot of discipline,\" she said.  \n     Others broke the line and went forward to hand over printed documents, saying the military's role in helping Venezuela emerge from an \"unsustainable\" situation is vital.  \"They think it's a joke. They don't take us seriously. They're not listening,\" said demonstrator Andrea Palma after police burned the paper with a lighter.  Divisions among the protesters were evident as some young men from poor neighborhoods scoffed at a speaker who insisted that the gathering must be peaceful.  \"It's the frustration talking,\" said demonstrator Mariajose Molina.  The latest displays of will come as the political standoff between Maduro and U.S.-backed Guaidó sinks deeper into a stalemate.  On Tuesday, Guaidó appeared outside a Caracas military base urged the military to overthrow his political rival.  As the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly waited, however, it became clear that his call had failed to rally armed forces to his side. Clashes between protesters and police then erupted, leaving five dead.  \n     Maduro's government has also shown signs of weakness and has not moved to arrest Guaidó, who the United States and over 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela's rightful leader.  More than three million Venezuelans have left the country to escape a shrinking economy, hyperinflation and shortages of necessities such as medicine.  The opposition blames the sharp decline on state corruption, mismanagement and authoritarianism and says Maduro's re-  last year was illegitimate. Maduro portrays Venezuela as a victim of U.S. antagonism toward the socialist principles championed by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.  On Saturday, one protester looked on as the printed proclamation was burned. He then wished the policeman a nice day.  \"See you later,\" replied the officer before turning away. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg#\" alt=\"George Blake Holding Coat \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/1280x720/a959f53d248f6fb7dc4ddfff51e2e2b3/blake.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104009", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

At least eight Palestinians, including a pregnant woman and her 14-month-old niece, have also been killed. \n     Israeli forces struck dozens of targets throughout Gaza, including militant sites that it said were concealed in homes or residential areas. The army also moved armored units toward the Gaza perimeter as the sides headed closer to all-out war. Moshe Agadi, a 58-year-old Israeli father of four, was struck in the chest by shrapnel in a residential courtyard from one of the 450 rockets fired from Gaza in less than 24 hours. Then a midday barrage hit Ashkelon again, wounding three people, including two seriously who were suffering from \"multisystem trauma.\" The Magen David Adom rescue service said another person was critically wounded when a rocket landed on a car near the Gaza boundary. \n  \n  \n\n \n The Israeli military has retaliated with some 260 airstrikes against militant targets in Gaza. \n\n    \n           The Palestinian Health Ministry had previously said an Israeli strike on Saturday killed a pregnant woman, Falistin Abu Arar, 37, and her niece, Seba Abu Arar, in their east Gaza City home. However, military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said Sunday that a detailed review found that a Palestinian rocket had misfired and killed them. He said the Palestinians were \"trying to sell a story that isn't true.\" The conflicting accounts could not immediately be reconciled. Hospital officials in Gaza confirmed the deaths of two men, ages 28 and 21. Islamic Jihad media outlets said the two were militants. Their deaths raised to nine the number of Palestinians killed in the recent fighting. \n     The sudden outburst has broken a month-long lull as Egyptian mediators had been trying to negotiate a long-term cease-fire between the two sides, who have fought three wars and several other rounds of conflict over the past decade. Conricus said Israel's strikes hit a variety of \"high-quality\" militant sites, that included commanders' homes in which militant activity was observed. He said he had no knowledge of civilians being harmed by Israeli fire. The military spokesman said Israel was deploying an armored brigade along the Gaza front, with tanks ready for offensive missions as needed. The Israeli military has already struck rocket launchers, tunnel shafts, training sites, storage depots and warehouses of both the territory's Hamas rulers and the smaller, Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was paying a \"heavy price\" for its rocket attacks against Israel and that it would be held accountable not only for its own militant actions but also for that of the Islamic Jihad, which operates under its jurisdiction in Gaza. Sirens wailed along the border region overnight and throughout the day warning of incoming attacks. School was canceled in southern Israel and emergency protocol enacted. As the day progressed, rockets were being fired deeper into the Israeli heartland. In Gaza, large explosions thundered across the blockaded enclave during the night as plumes of smoke rose into the air. By morning, bulldozers were clearing the streets from rubble and debris strewn on the ground and municipal workers were fixing damaged power lines. Owners of clothing stores that were destroyed in Gaza City's relatively upscale Remal neighborhood squatted across the streets from where their stores had stood, cupping their faces in their hands. \n\n    \n           One of the airstrikes hit a six-story commercial and residential building that housed the office of Turkey's official Anadolu news agency. \n     \"We thought the Rimal neighborhood is safe, but it seems there is no safe place in Gaza,\" said Nidal al-Dali, who lived in the building and lost his home. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called it a \"new example of Israel's unrestrained aggression.\" The Israeli military says its Iron Dome defense system intercepted more than 150 of the projectiles from Gaza, but several still managed to slip through. A rocket scored a direct hit on a residential home in the border town of Sderot. Jonathan Rieck, director of the emergency room at Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, said they had treated some 80 people, most from shock symptoms, but several with body wounds, including an elderly man who was in critical condition from head injuries. In a first, the hospital itself was also hit by debris from a rocket that was intercepted by an Iron Dome missile. There were no injuries. \n\n    \n           Israel has vowed to hit back hard against both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, whom it suspects of triggering the current conflagration. But, as in similar previous rounds where it stopped short of a full-fledged war, the timing for a prolonged round of fighting is tricky for Israel. The country marks Memorial Day and Independence Day this week. The following week it is set to host the Eurovision song contest in which large groups of tourists are expected to arrive for the festive event. For Gazans, the violence comes ahead of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan that begins Monday. \n     Hamas, an Islamic group vowed to Israel's destruction, forcefully seized control of Gaza in 2007. It most recently engaged in several days of heavy fighting with Israel in March before Egypt brokered a truce, in which Israel agreed to ease a crippling blockade on Gaza in exchange for a halt in rocket fire. In recent days, Hamas accused Israel of reneging on its pledges as militants began to fire rockets into Israel. Israel accuses Islamic Jihad of operating behind Hamas' back and instigating the latest round of violence by shooting and wounding two Israeli soldiers Friday. Two Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces the same day during the weekly protests along the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence. Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser, said the violence was being instigated by Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza at the behest of their backers in Iran. Amidror, currently a senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, said a new war in Gaza would distract Israel and leave Tehran \"free to continue what they are doing in Syria.\" The resurgence of violence threatened to shatter the shaky understandings recently reached though Egyptian mediators. Militant leaders were in Cairo trying to reach a new cease-fire. Hamas has hoped that Egyptian mediators could further ease the blockade, which has ravaged Gaza's economy. For over a year, the Islamic group has orchestrated mass demonstrations each week along the Israeli frontier to draw attention to Gaza's plight. More than 200 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have been killed in the border protests.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/7df38d8e-02f3-4d80-8e5a-ed2bb729e5c0/thumbnail/620x413/a1dbfc4f0dc9e6df0fc26a46cee11125/ap-19125419146467.jpg#\" alt=\"Israel Palestinians \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/7df38d8e-02f3-4d80-8e5a-ed2bb729e5c0/thumbnail/620x413/a1dbfc4f0dc9e6df0fc26a46cee11125/ap-19125419146467.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/7df38d8e-02f3-4d80-8e5a-ed2bb729e5c0/thumbnail/1240x826/2753cd6b55810aa4beca6a2c7a03b6d6/ap-19125419146467.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104009", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.cnn.com", "section": "Weather", "sub_section": "Political Op-Eds", "article_url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/19/opinions/barrett-aca-threaten-disabilities-cokley/index.html", "title": "Judge Barrett's view of Obamacare stirs fear among disabled Americans", "author": "", "author_link": null, "published_date": "Updated 6:33 PM ET, Mon October 19, 2020", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Nobody questions that Judge Barrett loves her family, but it is a simple fact that whether she is promoted to the Supreme Court or not, she will have a level of   that many if not most disabled people can only dream of -- especially if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.

And though he faced substance use disorder throughout his adult life, David was sober nearly the entire year leading up to the pandemic. When I saw him over dinner and donuts last November on a visit to Los Angeles, he was crushing life. I was proud of him. My handsome, charming big brother finally had it together. (Of course, even when he didn't have it \"together,\" he was still my biggest champion.) David was thriving as a personal trainer at a gym. He loved being a dad and absolutely adored his little girl. Although they weren't living together at the time, he would text me most days with photos and videos of my niece. The last text he ever sent me on March 13 was a paraphrase of a quote he'd heard by myth scholar Joseph Campbell: \"When you live a life for someone other than yourself, you are living a hero's journey,\" my brother wrote. At that point in time, David was on the cusp of a promotion at work -- unless the coronavirus really hurt business, he cautioned our father. His promotion never happened. And neither did my promise to visit him and my niece in March. Instead came the pandemic, and with it, a perfect storm for relapse. In the six days after David texted me, everything keeping him on track and on the path of treatment was gone. When California's stay-at-home order took effect  , David was suddenly out of work, unable to visit his daughter, and without a support network.  We worried about him. David plus free time was historically a recipe for disaster. I should have checked in. Aside from an email he sent me on March 17, congratulating me for a new article I wrote that week, I hadn't heard from David. The updates about my niece stopped. I should have known something was wrong. On the phone with our father an hour or so before we learned of my brother's death, our dad said to me, \"I'm worried about David. I don't know what kind of trouble he's going to get into now that he's not working and can't see his daughter. I think he's been sleeping all day.\" He sounded worried. David wasn't returning his calls that day. That night, I received a Facebook message from David's landlord asking me to give him a call. Thinking, hoping that David owed rent money, I sent his number to our father. My dad called me back shortly after speaking with the landlord, with a message he had long dreaded delivering: \"David passed away.\"", "image_url": "<img alt=\"Alyssa and her brother, David, pose for their last picture together in November 2019 in Los Angeles, CA. \" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/201019204448-03-alyssa-klein-and-brother-large-169.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104010", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added.

This \"digital patch\" is the first new effective treatment for lazy eye in half a century, researchers from the Glick Eye Institute at Indiana University said. Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, remains the most common cause of visual impairment in children. Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not develop normally during early childhood. This can occur when one eye is much more nearsighted than the other, or when one eye wanders or strays inward. The child needs to receive treatment by the age of 8 or so while their eyes and brain are still developing, or he or she could become blind in the weaker eye. A recent study found that 1 in 4 kids feel anxiety before using eye drops. Nearly 15 percent refuse to take eye drops at all. Both drops and eye patches work based on the occlusion method. This blocks vision in the eye with the best sight, forcing the brain to rely on the so-called lazy eye. During the process, vision improves though many children will still need glasses to correct their eyesight. In comparison, the electronic glasses used in the study combine vision correction and occlusion. The lenses can be filled to a child's vision prescription. Because the lenses are liquid crystal display (LCD), they can also be programmed to turn opaque, occluding vision in the left or right eye for different time intervals, acting like a digital patch that flickers on and off. Researchers recently tested the effectiveness of occlusion glasses compared to patching in a randomised clinical study. They recruited 33 subjects with lazy eye between age 3 and 8 who wore spectacles to correct their vision. One group wore an adhesive patch for two hours daily. The other wore Amblyz occlusion glasses for 4 hours daily. In the study, the lens over the eye with better vision switched from clear to opaque every 30 seconds. After three months, both groups of children showed the same amount of improvement in the lazy eye, gaining two lines on a reading chart. \"When you talk to adults who underwent childhood treatment for amblyopia, they will tell you that wearing a patch was the worst thing ever,\" said Daniel Neely, a paediatric ophthalmology professor at Indiana University who led the study. \"With these electronic occlusion glasses, the child learns that the lens will be clear again in just a few seconds so they may be more cooperative with the treatment. For parents who have struggled with drops and patching, this could be a great alternative,\" said Neely.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104008", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Currently, Lucy's bones are kept in a museum in Ethiopia. Here's more about our ancestor Lucy: 1) 'Lucy' was the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton ever found. Australopithecus afarensis is a species that shares both human and ape characteristics that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. Around 40 per cent of Lucy's remains were discovered intact. 2) Do you know who named her Lucy? Paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson named the fossils Lucy after the Beatles song ' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.' 3) Lucy is a crucial stepping stone between apes and Homo Sapiens. It was exactly 41 years ago from today when the oldest known example of a bipedal primate came into the knowledge of humans. 4) Lucy had numerous similarities with chimpanzees.The skeleton revealed that she mostly walked upright. Bipedalism, walking using two rear limbs or legs, is a key distinction between Homo Sapiens and chimpanzees. 5) According to  , with a mixture of ape and human features - including long dangling arms with pelvic, spine, foot, and leg bones suited to walking upright - slender Lucy stood three-and-a-half feet tall. 6) Lucy is determined as a female due to her size. Fossils that were discovered later were larger in size and were identified as males. 7) Lucy was fully grown, for her wisdom teeth were very human-like.

The start-up ecosystem seems to be holding up the jury is still out on this as these are still early days. In the last few years several start-ups have raised millions. While the valuations game is still not fully understood,and funding continues to be a double-edged sword. While funding is crucial for all types of companies, a well-funded company can create immense value and disrupt markets, mismanagement of funds or over funding can be a recipe for disaster. The Indian start-up environment is highly unforgiving. Failures are not celebrated but looked down on so a failed enterprise entrepreneur will find it difficult to regain investor confidence. Entrepreneurs sometimes lack the understanding as to if he needs to expose himself to fresh funding and what needs to be done. There is a need for start-ups to get access to a good mentor or advisor. Operating in this very environment is what Radar India Advisors does. Radar India Advisors was founded with the objective to be an advisor to these start-ups and also help them with access to funds. Set up in 2017, Radar India Advisors is an entrepreneur led outfit built to empower and engage entrepreneurs in their various stages of growth. The management of Radar has built and exited 3 different businesses themselves which helps the sensitise first time and even veteran entrepreneurs. In the last 2 years, the investments in start-ups advised by Radar has grown 10 times. Some of the start-ups managed by Radar include Smartivity, Avishkar Box, Coffee bond, Clevergene Biocorp and Pikapika. In the case of Smartivity and Avishkar Box, has worked closely right from the seed stage funding. Radar facilitated an early stage investment of Rs 60 lakhs from S Chand group into Smartivity. Today, Smartivity has raised a total of 22 crores is currently valued at 100 cr that’s a jump in valuation from 2 cr to 100 cr in 4 years. The revenues of Smartivity stand at Rs 20 cr. Similarly, Radar India Advisors was instrumental in facilitating a Pre-Series A funding of Rs 5 crore into Avishkar Box from Auxano Trust, their revenues stand at 18crore a jump of 800% from the initial 2cr. They are currently valued at 100cr. In the case of Coffee Bond, Radar facilitated a “Pre Series A” funding of Rs 1.5 crore from Auxano Trust in January 2019- revenue jump from Rs 80 Lakhs annually to Rs 3.23 crores in one year and their footprint has grown from one cafe outlet to 13 outlets of sale.  Clevergene Biocorp another company advised by Radar is in the process of closing a Pre-Series A funding from Auxano Trust and has seen a revenue jump from 2 crore to 6 crore(expected for FY 2019-20). PikaPika a kids app to censor content on phone for kids is another client for whom Radar has raised Rs 1 crore from Auxano trust in October and they have seen a big spike in users.  Speaking on the success that Radar has had so far Rahul Gupta CEO, Radar India Advisors Said, “It is important that when working with any start-up, it is critical that we understand what to look for I believe there are six main points that we need to look at, number one is to look for the right fight entrepreneur in diverse industries. People who understand their business and the environment they operate in. Number two is to build a personal touch with the entrepreneurs. Number three is to put your money where your mouth is or to invest into the client yourself. Number four is to look for businesses who are solution providers and not valuation hunters. And finally, we try and give PE level advisory to startups.

That’s a big if. This is not the first time the two sides have proclaimed an agreement — only for it to be shot down by lawmakers in London. Former Prime Minister Theresa May struck a deal with the EU in December 2018, but Parliament rejected it three times. Here’s a look at what is in the new agreement, and how it differs from May’s rejected deal. Ever since negotiations began more than two years ago, the key hurdle to a deal has been finding a way to keep goods and people flowing freely across the border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.’s Northern Ireland — the only land border between the U.K. and the bloc. An open border is vital to the regional economy, and underpins Northern Ireland’s peace process. May’s rejected deal contained a policy known as the backstop that kept Northern Ireland in harmony with EU trade and customs rules to eliminate the need for border checks. But that was   who said it would hamper Britain’s ability to strike new trade deals around the world. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted that all of the U.K. — including Northern Ireland — must leave the bloc’s customs union, which would seem to make border checks and tariffs inevitable. The proposed deal solves the problem by keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the rules of the EU single market for goods — so border checks are not needed — and also eliminating customs checks at the Irish border. Instead, customs checks will be carried out and tariffs levied by Britain on goods entering Northern Ireland that are destined for the EU. That effectively means a customs border in the Irish Sea — something the British government long said it would not allow. But the EU has compromised, too, by allowing Northern Ireland special access to its single market. And the deal gives Northern Ireland a say over the rules, something that was missing from May’s previous rejected agreement. After four years, the Northern Ireland Assembly will vote on whether to continue the arrangement or end it. Apart from the section on Northern Ireland, the deal is largely the same as May’s rejected withdrawal agreement. It lays out the terms of Britain’s departure, including:  If the deal is ratified, Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31 but remain inside the bloc’s single market and bound by its rules until the end of December 2020, while the two sides work out a new trade relationship.  Britain agrees to cover contributions to staff pensions and commitments to EU programs the U.K. made while a member for the funding period that runs to 2020. The bill has previously been estimated at about 39 billion pounds ($50 billion).  EU citizens now living in Britain, and Britons living or working in EU countries, won’t lose their rights to live and work in those areas.  In a non-binding political declaration that accompanies the withdrawal agreement, the two sides promise “an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation with a comprehensive and balanced Free Trade Agreement at its core.” Details of that trade deal, and many other aspects of the future relationship, will only be settled once the U.K. has left. EU leaders worry that Johnson’s Conservative government plans to tack toward a low-tax, low-regulation economy after it leaves the bloc. To lessen this worry — and in a concession by the U.K. government — the declaration commits both sides to maintaining a “level playing field,” with “common high standards . in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment.”  The two sides say they will have a “broad, comprehensive and balanced security partnership” but say the “scale and scope” of the relationship will depend on how close the future relationship is.  EU citizens will lose the right to live and work in Britain — and vice versa — but citizens of the U.K. and the EU will not need visas for short visits.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104010", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The next wave of growth could come from increasing exports to large and traditionally under penetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Latin America, which would help the industry meet its aspiration of becoming the world's largest supplier by volume, according to pharma industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). Experts said improved access to medicines in India and exploring new markets while maintaining thrust in the US will help the country's pharma industry to record double-digit growth in the coming year. However, the sector, specially pharmaceuticals, will be up against headwinds of increased costs related to regulatory compliances, particularly for the US market, price controls across markets and mandatory genericisation in India. \"The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is a sunrise industry with a competitive advantage for India. We should leverage India's position by unleashing entrepreneurial spirit through policy stability and ecosystem,\" IPA Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said. The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily. Medical devices makers' body, AdvaMed Vice President Abby Pratt said it would urge the government to promote the adoption of global harmonisation, including internationally recognised standards, that would not only help ensure the quality and efficacy of products but also enable an ecosystem for manufacturing, research, and innovation for benefits of patients in India.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104011", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Indian team on Friday announced their playing XI for the Boxing Day Test, making a host of changes to the line-up which featured in Adelaide. Right-handed batsman Gill, who had made 127 runs in the two warm-up games, will open the innings alongside Mayank Agarwal. Gill, who has played three ODIs, replaces Prithvi Shaw in the playing XI. Shaw had come under severe criticism following his failure in the pink-ball Test which India lost by eight wickets. Wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, who returned with scores of 9 and 4 in the first Test, has been replaced by Rishabh Pant. All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja comes into the side after clearing a fitness test on Thursday. Jadeja had injured his hamstring during the first T20I against Australia, minutes before he’d received a blow to the helmet from a Mitchell Starc delivery which led to a concussion. The team management had at that point recommended a three-week recovery period for the all-rounder. Right-arm fast bowler Siraj, who has played one ODI and three T20Is, comes into the side in place of Mohammad Shami who has been ruled out of the series because of an injury. Shami, 30, suffered a fracture on his bowling hand after he was hit by a ball from Australia pace bowler Pat Cummins during India’s second innings in the Adelaide Test. Ajinkya Rahane will lead the Indian side in absence of Virat Kohli who has returned home for the birth of his first child. Cheteshwar Pujara will serve as his deputy. : Ajinkya Rahane (captain), Mayank Agarwal, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara (vice-captain), Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

If the humiliation of getting bundled out for 36 wasn’t enough, India was handed a confidence-denting blow when pacer Mohammad Shami was ruled out of the remaining series with a fractured arm. Not to forget the departure of regular skipper and batting mainstay Virat Kohli as he was granted paternity leave by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). After India dominated the first two days of the opening Test, it took a once in a lifetime spell of pace bowling from the duo of Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to turn the table in Australia’s favour and that first session on the third afternoon combined with Joe Burns’ unbeaten fifty has given the hosts a huge confidence booster. The Indians on the other hand saw their chances of registering a win in the first game vanish in minutes. Now India and Australia are dealing with contrasting feelings as they head into the Boxing Day Test. India, who are without the services of their highest run-scorer (Kohli), now faces a problem with an unstable batting order as none managed to stand up in the second innings and deliver against the Australian attack. Prithvi Shaw looked out of place as he was dismissed in similar fashion — gap between bat and pad — in both the innings and while Shubman Gill is likely to be included in the playing XI for the second Test, it remains to be seen if he will replace Shaw or come in for Kohli. The right-handed batsman had hit the nets on Wednesday while Shaw worked with the support staff. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant too could find a place in the playing XI after first-choice wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha failed to deliver in the first Test. But it would be a little unfair to change the keeper for his failure with the bat. This is a call that stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane will have to make. Ravichandran Ashwin, who stole the show in the first Test, has cemented his place and India may go ahead with a twin spin combination if all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is fit to play. Another question that has troubled the visitors is who will replace injured Shami. T Natarajan has impressed everyone with his bowling skills in the limited-over format but Mohammad Siraj and Navdeep Saini are likely to move in as they are part of the Test squad. On the other hand, Australia will be riding on the back of a come-from-behind win in the first Test. While the win helped them maintain their 100 per cent win record in pink-ball Tests, Australia has emerged victorious seven times in their last ten outings in a Boxing Day Test and they would surely want to make that 8 in 11. Overall, the team from Down Under has won 25 matches from 39 games and pose a major threat to opponents when it comes to playing in Melbourne. Steve Smith, who had always dreamt of batting in the Boxing Day Test, has a great record in Australian cricket’s biggest annual event. The right-handed batsman has smashed over 900 runs with three half-centuries. Smith relished batting in a Boxing Day Test and walking out to bat gives him “shivers down the spine”. “Yeah, ten years it is quite hard to believe. Look it’s been since then, I have grown as a player over that time. My Boxing Day record is probably the best in Australia among all grounds. I like batting at MCG,” Smith said in a virtual press conference on Tuesday. It will be interesting to see if he can continue striking gold in the Boxing Day Test or if the Indian bowlers manage to break the spree. Australia coach Justin Langer has said that he is looking at fielding the same XI for the second Test and that clearly means the Indian batsmen have their task cut out when it comes to handling the hosts’ in-form pacers. The only silver lining in an otherwise dark cloud for India is the psychological advantage visitors enjoy over Australia. India had defeated Australia in the 2018 Boxing Day Test by 137 runs. : Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (captain), Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper), Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, R.

He currently sits on the national board of the Voluntad Popular political party, and is a member of the transitional government for Juan Guaidó, president of the National Assembly. If and when Guaidó takes control of the country from President Nicolás Maduro, Goicoechea will be tasked with overseeing the energy department in a new government. \n     Goicoechea is a 34-year-old attorney with a law degree from Columbia University. He is the recipient of the   Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty by the Cato Institute. His work with Guaidó goes back at least 15 years, when the two were student activists who opposed Hugo Chavez's government. Guaidó has been recognized by   and other countries as the rightful legitimate president of Venezuela.   Guaidó called upon the Venezuelan people and the army to rise up against Maduro, a call to action that caused chaos and did not lead to a change in the government. \n  \n  \n\n \n On Saturday, Goicoechea spoke with CBS News correspondent Adriana Diaz. He discussed the opposition's communications with Russia \"on several levels\"; the opposition's ongoing negotiations with the Maduro regime, including an offer of amnesty to defectors; and the possible military intervention by the U.S., which Goicoechea said should be only a last resort. \n\n    \n           DIAZ: Is the opposition speaking to the Russians? GOICOECHEA: Well, at some level, yes, what we have done is to express our will and our commitment to respect their investments in Venezuela, to recognize our debts with the Russians and to invite them to invest and participate in the new Venezuela. It's better for the Russians... DIAZ: Who has made that communication with the Russians? Has Guaidó? \n     GOICOECHEA: At several levels — we have done that at several levels. DIAZ: This week? Recently? GOICOECHEA: Recently, and one year ago and six months ago. It's something tried to do in terms of politics and policy — for us it's important to let them know that we are going to respect international investments in Venezuela. We are fighting for Venezuela which is ruled by the law — which is in international protections of investment because we know this system doesn't work.  So it's even better for Russia to have us in power — that means a democracy that will respect their debts and that we will have the possibility of paying back — this government doesn't have any chance of paying that back. DIAZ: And how are these negotiations going?  GOICOECHEA: In some cases, very well. For the first time in probably two decades we have a fluid conversation with people within the government and those people want to find a way to overcome Maduro and to find a place in the new democracy in Venezuela.  DIAZ: Are these leaders in the government? Are these leaders in the military? Because earlier this week the U.S. said that there were a handful of high level members of the government who were ready to join the opposition, but then the next day we saw them standing next to Maduro showing their loyalty to him.  \n     GOICOECHEA: Well, you know what happens every time in a dictatorship. The only day in which the military shows discontent with the dictatorship is the last day of a dictatorship. I'm not afraid of that. We all know what happened.  GOICOECHEA: [Cuba and Russia] are here. They have a huge intelligence operation right now in Venezuela, they are spying on our military, they are accusing our military.  DIAZ: Do you believe they are influencing the military and influencing Maduro?  GOICOECHEA: They are influencing Maduro, protecting Maduro and spying on our military. The main purpose of these countries here is to collect information, to avoid a coup and that's what they do — but the influence is real, it's important and it's dangerous, dangerous for the Venezuelan people.  DIAZ: The U.S. has said it is committed to seeing transition of power — would you want help from the U.S.?  GOICOECHEA: No one wants an intervention, but I see it may be possible, it may be necessary, an intervention.  No one in Venezuela wants an intervention of any country in our territory. I want a democratic, free, independent Venezuela, a peaceful Venezuela. I don't want war in Venezuela.  \n     And I want to find a political way out for Maduro. If that is possible, that's of course my first option. But what we won't do is stand a dictatorship for 20 more years.  GOICOECHEA: This isn't about an alliance with President Trump — this is an alliance with a very important country in this world, with a very admired country in this world, and with people who believe in freedom. So we kindly — we appreciate that you don't polarize Venezuelan issues in the United States. It's not a matter of supporting Trump or being against Trump: It's about values we have in common with the Western Hemisphere, defending people who are starving and getting mistreated in every way. We do share values with Donald Trump as we do share values with Democrats, as we do share values with the whole of the American people. Be aware the fight for Venezuela should be bipartisan and not even about a political party at all. It's about human values and our human condition that is being violated here in Venezuela.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/aaff7a30-2b84-4dcb-87b7-d47b3ab23969/thumbnail/620x424/9c957cca492891cca79318340bfbe012/yon.jpg#\" alt=\"Venezuela Mayoral Elections \" height=\"424\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/aaff7a30-2b84-4dcb-87b7-d47b3ab23969/thumbnail/620x424/9c957cca492891cca79318340bfbe012/yon.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/05/aaff7a30-2b84-4dcb-87b7-d47b3ab23969/thumbnail/1240x848/52bd761d594bdff210b87e61f480c9ae/yon.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20424'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104012", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

As per the University of Warwick research, the atmosphere of the planet, Kepler-438b, is thought to have been stripped away as a result of radiation emitted from a superflaring Red Dwarf star, Kepler-438. Regularly occurring every few hundred days, the superflares are approximately ten times more powerful than those ever recorded on the Sun and equivalent to the same energy as 100 billion megatons of TNT. While superflares themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on Kepler-438b's atmosphere, a dangerous phenomenon associated with powerful flares, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has the potential to strip away any atmosphere and render it uninhabitable. The planet Kepler-438b, to date the exoplanet with the highest recorded Earth Similarity Index, is both similar in size and temperature to the Earth but is in closer proximity to the Red Dwarf than the Earth is to the Sun. Lead researcher David Armstrong explained that if the planet, Kepler-438b, has a magnetic field like the Earth, it may be shielded from some of the effects, but if it does not, or the flares are strong enough, it could have lost its atmosphere, be irradiated by extra dangerous radiation and be a much harsher place for life to exist.

Mr. Trump's comments, delivered on Twitter, came as a Chinese delegation was scheduled to resume talks in Washington on Wednesday aimed at resolving a trade war that has shaken financial markets and cast gloom over the world economy. \n     Mr. Trump turned up the heat by saying he would raise import taxes on $200 billion in Chinese products to 25 percent from 10 percent Friday. He'd twice pushed back deadlines — in January and March — to raise the tariffs in a bid to buy more time for a negotiated settlement. But on Sunday, Mr. Trump, who has called himself a \"tariff man,\" said he's losing patience. \"The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!\" Mr. Trump  . \n  \n  \n\n \n In his tweets, Mr. Trump also threatened to slap tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese imports, covering everything China ships annually to the United States. The prospect of higher tariffs and heightened tensions could alarm investors when markets open Monday. \"When the president puts his foot down, it makes the market go down,\" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, wrote in a research note Sunday. \"Tariff man is back just in time to make the stock market dive, dive, dive.\"  U.S. stocks futures were sharply lower overnight, as were Asian stock markets. After the president's tweet, Beijing was said to be mulling the cancellation of a trip to Washington this week by a trade delegation in which it was thought a new trade deal might be reached. \n     The two countries are locked in a high-stakes dispute over China's push to establish itself as a technological super power. The U.S. charges that China is resorting to predatory tactics — including cybertheft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology — in a drive to establish Chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles. \n\n    \n           The administration has repeatedly suggested that the negotiators are making progress. A month ago, Trump said that the two countries were \"rounding the turn\" and predicted that \"something monumental\" would be achieved in the next few weeks. But last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin seemed to temper expectations, suggesting that Washington was willing to \"move on\" if it can't get the deal it wants. A substantive deal would require China to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions, abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies, easing up on the pressure for foreign companies to share trade secrets, and giving them more access to the Chinese market. Philip Levy, senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a White House economist under President George W. Bush, said the talks are too complicated for Mr. Trump's high-pressure tactics to work. \"The president treats this like we're haggling over the price of a used car,\" Levy said. Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of China's Global Times, an English-language state paper, sent   on Sunday that criticized Mr. Trump's approach, stating \"he seemingly doesn't understand how tariffs work.\" Mr. Trump has made a priority of shaking up American trade policy.  As a candidate for the presidency, Mr. Trump raged repeatedly about alleged Chinese perfidy — so much so that a video mashup of him spitting out the word \"China\" went viral and collected more than 15 million views on YouTube. \n     Mr. Trump charged that previous administrations, gullible and weak, had let China get away with abusive trade practices, accepting empty promises from Beijing and allowing the U.S.-China economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided. As evidence, he pointed to America's vast U.S. trade deficit with China — $379 billion last year, by far the biggest with any country in the world. Once he took office, Mr. Trump's relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, seemed to get off to a good start. The two men shared chocolate cake and amiable conversation at Trump's resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, in April 2017. A few weeks later, China agreed to open its market to U.S. beef, cooked chicken, and natural gas in what Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called a \"herculean accomplishment.\" The romance faded. In March 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative issued a report accusing China of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies. Last July, the Trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing into changing its policies. It now has imposed 10 percent  tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and 25 percent tariffs on another $50 billion. The Chinese have retaliated by targeting $110 billion in U.S. imports. The fight between the world's two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy, saying the U.S.-China standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies, build factories and make investments. Mr. Trump has portrayed his tariffs as a moneymaker for the United States and a benefit to the U.S. economy. But a March study by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University, and Princeton University found that the burden of Mr. Trump's tariffs — including taxes on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and Chinese imports — falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses who buy imported products.

New captain Ajinkya Rahane had a great day in office as he marshalled his resources impressively with debutant Mohammed Siraj (2/40 in 15 overs) repaying the faith shown in him with wickets of Marnus Labuschagne (48) and Cameron Green (12) with the old ball. However, the Test series is increasingly looking like Ashwin’s (3/35 in 24 overs) paradise as he once again made opposition’s best batsman Steve Smith (0) look ordinary, exploiting the turn and bounce that the first day of the MCG track offered. Bumrah (4/56 in 16 overs) was bowling as if it was business as usual, beating the bat and getting those breakthroughs just when it mattered on a pitch that had retained moisture. As it turned out, Rahane didn’t lose a bad toss. The Indian team looked way more galvanised despite being without regular skipper Vurat Kohli, who is on paternity leave. Some great catches were taken and the intent was way more visible. \nRahane’s first punt was introducing Ashwin inside the first hour of play after Bumrah had forced Joe Burns (0) to nick one to Rishabh Pant. Ashwin, who varied the pace of his deliveries cleverly got some turn and bounce straightaway as he drew Matthew Wade into coming down the track and skying one for India’s best fielder Ravindra Jadeja to take a well-judged catch running backwards. After one that jumped and turned beating Smith and Pant, Ashwin kept the next a tad straighter and the former Australian skipper’s glance was pouched by Cheteshwar Pujara at leg gully. \nAll this while, Bumrah was beating the bat at the other hand. Interestingly, Rahane didn’t give the debutant a single over before lunch break as he knew that Siraj’s strength is generating pace and movement with semi-new and old ball. Siraj, initially bowled a bit short at Labuschagne and Travis Head (38 off 92 balls) as they added 86 runs for the fourth wicket. It was Bumrah, who provided the post lunch breakthrough with a delivery that held its line and the left-hander’s thick edge was taken by Rahane at gully. Siraj’s maiden wicket was a lucky one as the ball was drifting down the leg-side which Labuschagne tried to whip but Shubman Gill, stationed at backward square leg, snapped it inches off the ground. However, the Hyderabad pacer’s second wicket was a much fuller ball with a hint of inward movement that caught Green plumb in-front. Skipper Tim Paine (13) couldn’t script a rescue act like Adelaide as a classical off-break saw him guide one straight into the hands of Hanuma Vihari at backward square leg. \nBumrah didn’t take much time after that as he and Ravindra Jadeja (1/15) polished off the tail in a jiffy.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bumrah-1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104011", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The 26-year-old fast bowler thus became the 298th player to get the Indian cap. There were two debutants in this match with opener Shubman Gill becoming the 297th player. Siraj, son of an autorickshaw driver, became the second Hyderabad fast bowler after Syed Abid Ali, who also made his debut against Australia at Adelaide way back in 1966-67 series, to play Test cricket for India. But the debutant fast bowler had to wait till 28th over before stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane gave him the ball after the lunch session.

He had a dream that Siraj would play for India in Test cricket. Within a month of his death, my brother has got that god-sent opportunity. It is one of the best news in recent times,’’ brother Ismail, a software Engineer, said from their Toli Chowki residence after hearing that his brother Mohd Siraj will make his Test debut against Australia in Melbourne on Saturday. Ghouse had passed away on November 19. “It was one of the biggest losses for our family. Siraj was inconsolable when he heard that `Abba jaan’ had died. We had great difficulty in controlling his emotions from here to Australia. He was very low in confidence and contemplated at one point even coming back to India. Luckily the Indian team members, particularly Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri, played a big role in consoling him,’’ added Ismail. Ismail pointed out: “My father would always say to Siraj make India proud. Desh Ko Roshan Karo. He always had a proud feeling whenever Siraj played for India. There was always a big smile on his face and sense of satisfaction whenever Siraj donned the Indian colours.’’ From the quaint lanes of Khaja Nagar in Banjara Hills, 26-year-old Siraj has fulfilled his father’s dreams. “We came through a lot of hardships. Being an autorickshaw driver, my father and mother Shabana Begum did all sundry works. I was studious while Siraj was always busy playing cricket in the small lanes. My mother was often upset because Siraj never focused his attention on studies. She would often beat him saying that he is wasting his career by playing the game. “But my father always supported Siraj. He would quietly slip in money in Siraj’s pocket and encouraged him to play cricket. Siraj was very passionate about the game and fast bowling. Today, we are all happy that he is going to play for India in Test cricket, that too at the magnificent MCG ground. He would be having my father’s blessings from heaven. It is a big moment for our family,’’ said Ismail, who had passed his engineering in 2014 and now acts as a manager for his brother. Siraj had moved to Toli Chowki where he could give best comforts to his parents. “We have not sold our father’s auto. He proudly travelled in Jeep Compass in the last few years.’’ Former chairman of National selection Committee MSK Prasad said he always believed Siraj had the potential to play for India. “He is one of the successful cricketers in India A matches. He has taken six or more five-wicket hauls that too against big teams. We thought he was a very good red-ball cricket as he could move the late and was a work-horse.’’ P Jyothi Prasad, who was the chairman of the Hyderabad selection committee when Siraj made his Ranji debut in 2014-15 season, said this Hyderabad fast bowler always excited him. “He had the hunger to excel in big stage.’’ Siraj will be the second Hyderabad fast bowler after Syed Abid Ali, who incidentally made his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide way back in 1966, to play for India in Test cricket.

He also said they were in good position in the first two days of the pink-ball Test. “We had two good days but had just one bad hour where we lost completely. The talk in the dressing room was about backing ourselves as an individual and as a team and stick to the plan whatever it is,” he added on the eve of the second Test. However, Kohli’s departure weakened the Indian batting a bit in trouble and Rahane conceded that they would miss their skipper. There were suggestions to promote himself to No.4 but the middle-order batsman said they have not decided anything yet. “Openers role is crucial but I don’t want to put pressure on them. Just want to give them freedom to play. We will definitely miss Virat. When you have a player like him, it is great for the team.” \nIndia looked in a good position with Kohli and Rahane batting well in the first innings before Kohli was run out. Speaking about the incident, he revealed the momentum shifted in hosts’ favour. “It was a tough one. We were going really well. I saw the momentum going in Australia’s way after the run out. After the end of play, I said sorry to him (Kohli) and he was ok with it. He understood the situation. Such things happen and you have to respect that and move forward.” He further informed that Kohli had a message for the team before heading to India. “He spoke to all of us before leaving. We had a team dinner in Adelaide. He spoke about playing to our strength. We have been playing well. We have to help each other and enjoy each other’s success.” The bowling department will be without Mohammad Shami, who was injured and ruled out of the remainder of the series but the 32-year-old said they are capable of delivering the goods. “Bumrah is a quality bowler and he has been doing really well. Apart from that, Umesh (Yadav) and a guy who will play (Mohammad Siraj), it is about bowling in partnerships. We have discussed how to go about it. It is about bowling in partnerships and bowling towards the plan.” When asked about Australia coach Justin Langer’s comments where he said Indians were under stress after the loss, Rahane added, “Australians are very good at playing mind games. Let them do that. We are focusing on ourselves on what we need to do. We will back ourselves and be positive,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

Here's why ", "author": null, "author_link": "http://www.catchnews.com/author/speed-news-desk-1436187530.html", "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Size doesn't matter here! Elephants tend to have smaller sperm than mice because the larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length, a new study suggests. In the animal world, if several males mate with the same female, their sperm compete to fertilise her limited supply of eggs. Longer sperm often seem to have a competitive advantage.  However, the study conducted by researchers from the Universities of Zurich and Stockholm now shows that the size of the animals also matters. The larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length. That is why elephants have smaller sperm than mice, researchers said. Stefan Lupold from the University of Zurich and his colleague John Fitzpatrick from University of Stockholm compared the influence of sperm competition on the evolution of sperm in 100 mammalian species.  Unlike previous studies, however, they did not just consider sperm length, but also the number of sperm per ejaculate, which is important as the resources available for sperm production need to be shared between sperm size and number. In other words, the longer every individual sperm, the fewer of them a testicle of a certain size can produce. Earlier studies suggested that the number of sperm might be just as important as sperm length, if not even more so.  After all, the more sperm a male fields against his competitors, the greater the likelihood that one of them will win. Based on their joint consideration of sperm size and number, and with the aid of new meta-analytical methods, the researchers now show that species facing intense sperm competition invest more in their ejaculates on average than their monogamous counterparts. Moreover, they discovered that whether the length or the number of sperm is more important actually depends on the size of the animals.  The bigger the animal, the greater the selection pressure on the overall investments in ejaculates and the more important the number of sperm becomes compared to sperm length. This is due to the more voluminous female reproductive tract, in which the sperm tend to get lost or become \"diluted.\"  In larger species, sperm length or speed probably comes into effect only if a sufficient number of sperm manage to get near the egg, researchers said. In smaller species, however, the distance for sperm to cover is shorter and the risk of loss much smaller, allowing the advantage of longer sperm to manifest itself. As a result, you tend to find the most complex sperm forms in small species, not in large ones. For instance, small fruit flies have the longest sperm ever described, not whales, whose sperm are less than a tenth of a millimetre long and almost a thousand times shorter than those of the flies.

That could mean a wider conflict neither side seems to want has been averted, at least for now.  \n     The escalation had killed 23 on the Gaza side, both militants and civilians, while on the Israeli side four civilians were killed from incoming fire.  The Islamic Jihad militant group, which Israel accused of instigating the latest violence, confirmed that a \"mutual and concurrent\" truce had been brokered by Egypt. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said Egyptian mediators, along with officials from Qatar and the U.N., helped reach the deal. He said Hamas could still use \"different pressuring tools\" to pressure Israel into easing a crippling blockade of Gaza it has enforced along with Egypt. \n\n    \n           Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pointedly noted that \"the campaign is not over, and it requires patience and judgment.\"  \n  \n  \n\n \n The intense fighting over the past two days came to a halt in the early morning hours and residents on both sides went back to their daily routines. The Israeli military said that as of 7 a.m., \"all protective restrictions in the home front will be lifted.\"  Schools and roads had been closed, and residents had been encouraged to remain indoors and near bomb shelters as intense rocket fire pounded the area, threatening to devolve into all-out war.  Israel and Hamas are bitter enemies and have fought three wars and numerous smaller battles since the Islamic militant group seized Gaza in 2007.  In the latest fighting, which erupted over the weekend, Palestinian militants fired hundreds of rockets into Israel, while the Israeli military responded with airstrikes on some 350 militant targets inside Gaza, including weapons storage, attack tunnels and rocket launching and production facilities. \n\n    \n           It also deployed tanks and infantry forces to the Gaza frontier, and put another brigade on standby. A Hamas commander involved in transferring Iranian funds to the group was killed in an airstrike, in an apparent return to Israel's policy of \"targeting killing\" of militant leaders.  \n     Palestinian medical officials reported 23 deaths, including at least nine militants as well as two pregnant women and two babies. The four Israeli civilians killed were the first Israeli fatalities from rocket attacks since the 50-day war in 2014. One was killed when his vehicle was hit by a Kornet anti-tank missile near the Gaza border.  Egyptian mediators had been working with the U.N. to broker a cease-fire. Under past Egyptian-brokered deals, Israel has agreed to ease its joint blockade of Gaza with Egypt in exchange for a halt to rocket fire.  The latest fighting broke out after Palestinian militants accused Israel of not honoring an earlier cease-fire deal from March, and opened fire on soldiers on the Israeli side of the Gaza border.  The terms of the latest deal were not known, but recent cease-fires have been short-lived.  In weary communities in southern Israel, there was criticism that the latest round of fighting had ended without tangible results - and no hope that it would not recur soon.  \"When we have the upper hand, we need once and for all to finish the terror because this will repeat itself and will not stop,\" said Jacque Mendel, a resident of the coastal city of Ashdod, where a man was killed in his car by a rocket Sunday night.  Despite its fierce response, Israel appears to have little appetite for another prolonged conflict. Later this week, the country marks Memorial Day, one of the most solemn days of the year, followed by the festive Independence Day. Next week, Israel is to host the popular Eurovision song contest and the backdrop of fighting would have likely overshadowed the occasions and deterred foreign tourists.  \n     Netanyahu, who recently secured re-  in part thanks to the votes of the rocket-battered residents along the Gaza Strip frontier, has traditionally been cautious in his handling of Gaza, for fear of sparking an open-ended war with no clear endgame. But he is under pressure from the same electorate to end its anguish and his perspective coalition partners appear to favor a more hard-line agenda on Gaza.  Even within his own ruling Likud Party, Netanyahu faced unusual criticism for not going further to quash Gaza militants.  Likud lawmaker Gideon Saar wrote on Twitter that the reported cease-fire was not an achievement for Israel. \"The timeframes between these violent attacks on Israel and its citizens are getting shorter and the terror groups in Gaza are getting stronger between them,\" he wrote.  Benny Gantz, Israel's emerging opposition leader, also criticized Netanyahu, saying that ending the current round amounted to \"another surrender to the extortion of Hamas and the terror organizations.\"  In Gaza, a year of Hamas-led protests along the Israeli frontier against the blockade that has ravaged the economy has yielded no tangible benefits. In March, Hamas faced several days of street protests over the dire conditions.  Still, Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh said late Sunday that the militant group was \"not interested in a new war,\" and the start on Monday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan likely lessened motivation for battle.  Signs of normal life slowly returned to Gaza, with banks opening after three days; schools are to reopen on Tuesday.  \n     In the northern Gaza Strip, residents searched for a man and his wife missing among the rubble of an apartment building. The upper two floors of the five-story structure in the Sheikh Zayed residential complex was hit by an Israeli airstrike and four Palestinians - a 12-year-old boy, an infant and her parents - were killed.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/06/c90c118d-06d5-400d-b4cc-2a1fad37d70a/thumbnail/620x413/4b7df26cabf2edd148263e842cb9e948/2019-05-06t063541z-112183782-rc1c10801520-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians.jpg#\" alt=\"Palestinian man sits on debris near a building that was destroyed by Israeli air strikes, in Gaza City \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/06/c90c118d-06d5-400d-b4cc-2a1fad37d70a/thumbnail/620x413/4b7df26cabf2edd148263e842cb9e948/2019-05-06t063541z-112183782-rc1c10801520-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/06/c90c118d-06d5-400d-b4cc-2a1fad37d70a/thumbnail/1240x826/4239baa06c81f70411e4abe163e4bdd2/2019-05-06t063541z-112183782-rc1c10801520-rtrmadp-3-israel-palestinians.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104012", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Cougar helicopter hurtled into a mountain outside Caracas in the early hours of an overcast day in the capital. An investigation was underway.  \n     The armed forces in a statement said the chopper was heading to San Carlos in Cojedes state. That's near a military academy where Maduro appeared early Saturday to oversee training exercises following a week of intrigue that saw a small group of security forces turn against him in the failed attempt by opposition leader Juan Guaidó to overthrow the government.  On board the helicopter were two lieutenant colonels as well as five lower-ranking officers. The statement didn't say if the chopper was part of the presidential delegation.  \n  \n  \n\n \n Also in Caracas on Saturday, a protester handed over a written appeal for the military's support, but a Venezuelan policeman burned the document and let the ashes fall to the ground.  \n\n           The armed forces \"won't be blackmailed or bought,\" said a second officer standing nearby.  Benito Rodriguez fumed as he watched the events unfold.  \"It's a humiliation,\" said Rodriguez, a demonstrator who had joined a crowd of about 150 protesters gathered near La Casona, a residence historically used by Venezuelan presidents.  \n     The scene highlights the uphill battle now facing opponents of Maduro who have failed to persuade the country's security forces to join efforts to oust the leader.  The critical role of the Venezuelan military in the country's crisis was on display as Maduro tried to portray strength by joining troops at the military academy, while Guaidó attempted to woo the armed forces to his side by urging supporters to the streets.  National television showed Maduro wearing a camouflage hat as he shook hands and exchanged fist bumps with security forces during a visit to a military base before watching troops engage in a shooting exercise.  \"Loyal forever,\" Maduro bellowed to a crowd of cadets in green uniforms.  Guaidó, meanwhile, told backers to go to military garrisons to persuade forces to turn against Maduro, whose years in office have been marked by escalating hardship for most people in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in Latin America.  As demonstrators linked arms and moved toward police, protest leader Maria Suarez urged calm.  \"Please, a lot of discipline,\" she said.  \n     Others broke the line and went forward to hand over printed documents, saying the military's role in helping Venezuela emerge from an \"unsustainable\" situation is vital.  \"They think it's a joke. They don't take us seriously. They're not listening,\" said demonstrator Andrea Palma after police burned the paper with a lighter.  Divisions among the protesters were evident as some young men from poor neighborhoods scoffed at a speaker who insisted that the gathering must be peaceful.  \"It's the frustration talking,\" said demonstrator Mariajose Molina.  The latest displays of will come as the political standoff between Maduro and U.S.-backed Guaidó sinks deeper into a stalemate.  On Tuesday, Guaidó appeared outside a Caracas military base urged the military to overthrow his political rival.  As the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly waited, however, it became clear that his call had failed to rally armed forces to his side. Clashes between protesters and police then erupted, leaving five dead.  \n     Maduro's government has also shown signs of weakness and has not moved to arrest Guaidó, who the United States and over 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela's rightful leader.  More than three million Venezuelans have left the country to escape a shrinking economy, hyperinflation and shortages of necessities such as medicine.  The opposition blames the sharp decline on state corruption, mismanagement and authoritarianism and says Maduro's re-  last year was illegitimate. Maduro portrays Venezuela as a victim of U.S. antagonism toward the socialist principles championed by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.  On Saturday, one protester looked on as the printed proclamation was burned.

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route. A clarification on the non-applicability of the new FDI measure would be critical for them to continue making massive investments in India,\" it added.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104013", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104013", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

READ THE FULL LETTER HERE:  The White House on Oct. 6 said that it was moving U.S. forces from northeast Syria following a call between Trump and Erdogan. For months earlier, Erdogan had been threatening to launch a military offensive into northern Syria, where Kurdish forces have been fighting alongside U.S. troops against ISIS. The withdrawal has essentially left the Kurdish fighters to both fight off ISIS and defend themselves from Turkish incursions, and has drawn   on Capitol Hill and from other world leaders. The White House defended the withdrawal by claiming that ISIS has been defeated. Intelligence experts say that’s not the case.

Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats walked out of a meeting at the White House, accusing him of having a “meltdown,” calling her a “third-rate politician” and having no plan to deal with a potentially revived Islamic State group. Condemnation of Trump’s stance on Turkey, Syria and the Kurds was quick and severe during the day, not only from Democrats but from Republicans who have been staunch supporters on virtually all issues. The House, bitterly divided over the Trump impeachment inquiry, banded together for an overwhelming 354-60 denunciation of the U.S. troop withdrawal. Many lawmakers expressed worry that it may lead to revival of IS as well as Russian presence and influence in the area — in addition to the slaughter of many Kurds. At the White House, Trump said the U.S. has no business in the region — and not to worry about the Kurdish fighters. “They know how to fight,” he said. “And by the way, they’re no angels.” After the House condemnation vote, the congressional leaders of both parties went to the White house for a briefing, which grew contentious, with Trump and Pelosi trading jabs. The Democrats said they walked out when the meeting devolved into an insult-fest. “What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown,” Pelosi told reporters, saying Trump appeared visibly “shaken up” over the House vote. “We couldn’t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it,” she said. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Trump for not having an adequate plan to deal with IS fighters who have been held by the Kurds. He said the meeting “was not a dialogue, this was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts.” Republicans pushed back, saying it was Pelosi who’d been the problem. “She storms out of another meeting, trying to make it unproductive,” said House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham called Pelosi’s action “baffling but not surprising.” She said the speaker “had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues.” Trump himself has stalked out of his White House meetings with congressional leaders — in May, saying he would no longer work with Democrats unless they dropped all Russia investigations, and last January during the partial government shutdown. Separately on Wednesday, a letter was disclosed in which he both cajoled and threatened Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week, urging him to act only in “the right and humane way” in Syria. He started on a positive note, suggesting they “work out a good deal,” but then talked about crippling economic sanctions and concluded that the world “will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don’t happen. Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool!” In public appearances Wednesday, Trump said he was fulfilling a campaign promise to bring U.S. troops home from “endless wars” in the Middle East — casting aside criticism that a sudden U.S. withdrawal from Syria betrays the Kurdish fighters, stains U.S. credibility around the world and opens an important region to Russia, which is moving in. “We have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria’s not happy about it. Let them work it out,” Trump said. “They have a problem at a border. It’s not our border. We shouldn’t be losing lives over it.” Trump said he was sending Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ankara to urge the Turks to halt their weeklong offensive into northeastern Syria. But his remarks, first to reporters in the Oval Office and later at a news conference with his Italian counterpart, suggested he sees little at stake for America. “Syria may have some help with Russia, and that’s fine,” he said. “They’ve got a lot of sand over there. So, there’s a lot of sand that they can play with.” “Let them fight their own wars.” More than once, Trump suggested the United States has little concern in the Middle East because it is geographically distant — a notion shared by some prior to Sept. 11, 2001, when al-Qaida militants used Afghanistan as a base from which to attack the U.S. That attack set off a series of armed conflicts, including in Iraq, that Trump considers a waste of American lives and treasure. The current withdrawal is the worst decision of Trump’s presidency, said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who meets often with the president and is one of his strongest and most important supporters in Congress. “To those who think the Mideast doesn’t matter to America, remember 9/11 — we had that same attitude on 9/10 2001.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he strongly disagreed with Trump and had told the president so. But he asked, “What tools do we have” to back up that disagreement? Turkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria a week ago, two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the area. Turkey’s Erdogan has said he wants to create a 30-kilometer (20-mile) -deep “safe zone” in Syria. Ankara has long argued the Kurdish fighters are nothing more than an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside Turkey since the 1980s and which Turkey, as well as the U.S. and European Union, designate as a terrorist organization. Trump mischaracterized the progress made thus far by the U.S. military in carrying out his instructions to withdraw all 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria. He referred to the approximately two dozen soldiers who evacuated from Turkey’s initial attack zone last week, but cast that as meaning the U.S. has “largely” completed its pullout. A U.S. official familiar with planning for the withdrawal of the 1,000 said that they are consolidating onto two main bases but have not yet begun flying out of Syria in significant numbers. Military equipment is being gathered and flown out, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the withdrawal, which poses big security risks. Trump downplayed the crisis that followed his decision to pull out of Syria, which critics say amounted to giving Turkey a green light to invade against the Kurdish fighters. “It’s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like you to believe,” Trump said. “Our soldiers are not in harm’s way, as they shouldn’t be.” Trump did impose new sanctions on Turkey this week in an attempt to force Erdogan to end his assault. But he said Wednesday, “It’s time for us to come home.” Even as Trump defended his removal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, he praised his decision to send more troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom defend against Iran. Trump said the U.S. is sending missiles and “great power” to the Saudis, and “they’re paying for that.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104014", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.cnn.com", "section": "Weather", "sub_section": "Success", "article_url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/15/success/annual-performance-reviews-pandemic/index.html", "title": "Everything is different in 2020, including your performance review", "author": "", "author_link": null, "published_date": "Updated 10:34 AM ET, Tue December 15, 2020", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "But it has brought about changes to the process.

However, the full extent of the damage was yet to be known, officials said Saturday. \n     The cyclone packed winds of 155 miles per hour when it made landfall in eastern Odisha state on Friday, equivalent in strength to a Category 4 hurricane, said Mohammad Heidarzadei, an expert on cyclones at Brunel University of London. As of late Saturday, India's National Disaster Response Force director S.N.

Fani crossed over India's West Bengal state and moved northeast toward Bangladesh on Saturday, weakening from a severe cyclonic storm to a cyclonic storm.

Orion's thermal protection system is one of the most critical parts of the spacecraft intended to facilitate human exploration of asteroids and of Mars. It consists of the spacecraft's main heat shield that faces into the atmosphere on reentry to slow the spaceship down and also the grid of tiles known as the back shell. During Orion's next mission atop the agency's Space Launch System rocket, called Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the spacecraft will be in space for more than three weeks and return to Earth under even faster and hotter conditions than during its last flight. \"As we move towards building the system for EM-1, we've been able to take advantage of what we learned from building and flying Orion to refine our processes going forward,\" said John Kowal, NASA's thermal protection system lead for Orion. During EM-1, Orion will endure a more intense re-entry environment. While the spacecraft encountered speeds of 30,000 feet per second during Exploration Flight Test-1 and temperatures of approximately 2,204 degrees Celsius, it will experience a faster return from lunar velocity of about 36,000 feet per second. The speed difference may seem subtle, but the heating the vehicle sees increases exponentially as the speed increases. Engineering teams are preparing Orion's heat shield to perform re-entry during any of missions planned near the Moon or in high lunar orbit in the coming years. For these future Orion missions, a silver, metallic-based thermal control coating will be bonded to the crew module's thermal protection system back shell tiles. The coating, similar to what is used on the main heat shield, will reduce heat loss during phases when Orion is pointed to space and therefore experiencing cold temperatures, as well as limit the high temperatures the crew module will be subjected to when the spacecraft faces the Sun. The coating will help Orion's back shell maintain a temperature range from approximately minus 101 to 287 degrees Celsius prior to entry and also will protect against electrical surface charges in space and during re-entry. Engineers have also refined the design in ways that improve the manufacturing process and reduce the mass of the spacecraft for the upcoming exploration missions. Instead of a monolithic outer layer, the heat shield will be made of about 180 blocks that can be made simultaneously with the other heat shield components to streamline the labour-and-time-intensive manufacturing process. In addition, engineers have found ways to reduce the mass of the heat shield's underlying structure, which is composed of a titanium skeleton and carbon fiber skin.

NASA's Curiosity Rover recently spotted a mysterious object on Mars which is very similar to a cluster of statues on Earth. It is like the statues present on the Easter Island in the South Pacific. A carved face can be seen on the hills of Mars. The latest discovery was made by two famous online UFO researchers after they closely examined a photo from NASA.  They noted- \"This giant face on a hill was found by Mister Enigma of Youtube. He says it looks like the faces on Easter Island and he is correct. This face is placed on the hill much like George Washington's face is at Mount Rushmore, SD.

Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said the current slowdown in exports is mainly due to a decline in petroleum products, which constitute 13.42 per cent of overall outward shipments. This decline, he said, is mainly on account of fall in petroleum prices which has driven the export value downwards. However, \"the positive growth in the exports of non-conventional commodity groups like electronic goods, drugs, and pharmaceuticals, organic and inorganic chemicals, augurs well for future growth,\" he told PTI. India's export growth is in the negative zone since August 2019 due to a steep fall in shipments of key sectors like petroleum, engineering and gems and jewellery. Labour-intensive sectors such as carpets, ready-made garments, handloom and leather too are recording decline in export growth. As per the World Trade Organization (WTO), global merchandise trade volumes are expected to rise by only 1.2 per cent in 2019, substantially slower than the 2.6 per cent growth forecast in April 2019. However in 2020, the growth in trade volume is projected to accelerate to 2.7 per cent. Apex exporters body Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said the global situation is becoming extremely challenging as rising protectionism is leading to uncertainty. FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai said the global situation is likely to improve in the first half of 2020, which would have a positive impact on India's exports. \"If the global situation improves, which is likely in the first half of 2020, we may look for 15 per cent growth in exports in the next financial year (2020-21). Exports will come out of negative zone next year but the rate of growth will not be in double digits,\" he said. He added that the order book position of Indian exporters is encouraging and less volatility in the domestic currency has also been a positive factor for traders. Sahai also said that Indian exports have to be aligned with changing import patterns of the global economy as 50 per cent of the world imports today is accounted by electrical and electronics products, automobiles, machinery, petroleum products and plastic items. \"While employment-intensive sectors should be pushed in exports, the new strategy should focus on technology-driven sectors,\" he said. Sharing similar views, Professor Rakesh Mohan Joshi from the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) said the steps taken by the government would help exports record growth in 2020. \"There is a need to take structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of Indian products in the global markets,\" Joshi said. The commerce ministry is considering several steps such as the announcement of the new WTO-compliant export incentive scheme and the new foreign trade policy for the next five years in 2020 to push the country's exports. The ministry has conducted a series of meetings with concerned stakeholders to finalise the foreign trade policy. On the trade front, India has been negotiating the mega free trade agreement RCEP  (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) since 2013. But in November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will not join the RCEP deal as negotiations failed to satisfactorily address New Delhi's \"outstanding issues and concerns\". Since January this year, exports have recorded a low rate of growth and slipped into the negative zone in August. During April-November 2019-20, the country's exports contracted by 2 per cent to USD 212 billion. Going by the current trend, FIEO has estimated that the exports may stand at USD 330-340 billion in the current fiscal. In 2018-19, the exports grew by 9 per cent to USD 331 billion from USD 303.5 billion in 2017-18. Since 2011-12, India's exports have been hovering at around USD 300 billion.

Hours later, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats walked out of a meeting at the White House, accusing him of having a “meltdown,” calling her a “third-rate politician” and having no plan to deal with a potentially revived Islamic State group. Condemnation of Trump’s stance on Turkey, Syria and the Kurds was quick and severe during the day, not only from Democrats but from Republicans who have been staunch supporters on virtually all issues. The House, bitterly divided over the Trump impeachment inquiry, banded together for an overwhelming 354-60 denunciation of the U.S. troop withdrawal. Many lawmakers expressed worry that it may lead to revival of IS as well as Russian presence and influence in the area — in addition to the slaughter of many Kurds. At the White House, Trump said the U.S. has no business in the region — and not to worry about the Kurdish fighters. “They know how to fight,” he said. “And by the way, they’re no angels.” After the House condemnation vote, the congressional leaders of both parties went to the White house for a briefing, which grew contentious, with Trump and Pelosi trading jabs. The Democrats said they walked out when the meeting devolved into an insult-fest. “What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown,” Pelosi told reporters, saying Trump appeared visibly “shaken up” over the House vote. “We couldn’t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it,” she said. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized Trump for not having an adequate plan to deal with IS fighters who have been held by the Kurds. He said the meeting “was not a dialogue, this was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts.” Republicans pushed back, saying it was Pelosi who’d been the problem. “She storms out of another meeting, trying to make it unproductive,” said House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham called Pelosi’s action “baffling but not surprising.” She said the speaker “had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues.” Trump himself has stalked out of his White House meetings with congressional leaders — in May, saying he would no longer work with Democrats unless they dropped all Russia investigations, and last January during the partial government shutdown. Separately on Wednesday, a letter was disclosed in which he both cajoled and threatened Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week, urging him to act only in “the right and humane way” in Syria. He started on a positive note, suggesting they “work out a good deal,” but then talked about crippling economic sanctions and concluded that the world “will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don’t happen. Don’t be a tough guy. Don’t be a fool!” In public appearances Wednesday, Trump said he was fulfilling a campaign promise to bring U.S. troops home from “endless wars” in the Middle East — casting aside criticism that a sudden U.S. withdrawal from Syria betrays the Kurdish fighters, stains U.S. credibility around the world and opens an important region to Russia, which is moving in. “We have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria’s not happy about it. Let them work it out,” Trump said. “They have a problem at a border. It’s not our border. We shouldn’t be losing lives over it.” Trump said he was sending Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Ankara to urge the Turks to halt their weeklong offensive into northeastern Syria. But his remarks, first to reporters in the Oval Office and later at a news conference with his Italian counterpart, suggested he sees little at stake for America. “Syria may have some help with Russia, and that’s fine,” he said. “They’ve got a lot of sand over there. So, there’s a lot of sand that they can play with.” “Let them fight their own wars.” More than once, Trump suggested the United States has little concern in the Middle East because it is geographically distant — a notion shared by some prior to Sept. 11, 2001, when al-Qaida militants used Afghanistan as a base from which to attack the U.S. That attack set off a series of armed conflicts, including in Iraq, that Trump considers a waste of American lives and treasure. The current withdrawal is the worst decision of Trump’s presidency, said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who meets often with the president and is one of his strongest and most important supporters in Congress. “To those who think the Mideast doesn’t matter to America, remember 9/11 — we had that same attitude on 9/10 2001.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he strongly disagreed with Trump and had told the president so. But he asked, “What tools do we have” to back up that disagreement? Turkish troops and Turkish-backed Syrian fighters launched their offensive against Kurdish forces in northern Syria a week ago, two days after Trump suddenly announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the area. Turkey’s Erdogan has said he wants to create a 30-kilometer (20-mile) -deep “safe zone” in Syria. Ankara has long argued the Kurdish fighters are nothing more than an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has waged a guerrilla campaign inside Turkey since the 1980s and which Turkey, as well as the U.S. and European Union, designate as a terrorist organization. Trump mischaracterized the progress made thus far by the U.S. military in carrying out his instructions to withdraw all 1,000 troops in northeastern Syria. He referred to the approximately two dozen soldiers who evacuated from Turkey’s initial attack zone last week, but cast that as meaning the U.S. has “largely” completed its pullout. A U.S. official familiar with planning for the withdrawal of the 1,000 said that they are consolidating onto two main bases but have not yet begun flying out of Syria in significant numbers. Military equipment is being gathered and flown out, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the withdrawal, which poses big security risks. Trump downplayed the crisis that followed his decision to pull out of Syria, which critics say amounted to giving Turkey a green light to invade against the Kurdish fighters. “It’s not between Turkey and the United States, like a lot of stupid people would like you to believe,” Trump said. “Our soldiers are not in harm’s way, as they shouldn’t be.” Trump did impose new sanctions on Turkey this week in an attempt to force Erdogan to end his assault. But he said Wednesday, “It’s time for us to come home.” Even as Trump defended his removal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, he praised his decision to send more troops and military equipment to Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom defend against Iran. Trump said the U.S. is sending missiles and “great power” to the Saudis, and “they’re paying for that.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104015", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "telanganatoday.com", "section": "Sport", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://telanganatoday.com/lightning-bolt-rivadavia-shine-in-trials", "title": "Lightning Bolt, Rivadavia shine in trials", "author": " ", "author_link": null, "published_date": "26th Dec 2020", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": ": Lightning Bolt, Rivadavia & Bahamas pleased when the following horses were exercised at Malakpet Race Course on Friday morning. : \nKenya (G Naresh) 47, handy.

However, the full extent of the damage was yet to be known, officials said Saturday. \n     The cyclone packed winds of 155 miles per hour when it made landfall in eastern Odisha state on Friday, equivalent in strength to a Category 4 hurricane, said Mohammad Heidarzadei, an expert on cyclones at Brunel University of London. As of late Saturday, India's National Disaster Response Force director S.N. Pradhan said three people had been killed, though the storm smashed thatched-roof huts, uprooted trees and power lines, ripped the roof off a medical college and sprayed the emptied coastline with debris. \"The precautions that have been taken should be continued,\" Pradhan said. \n  \n  \n\n \n Officials cautioned that the death toll could rise as communications were restored. Fani crossed over India's West Bengal state and moved northeast toward Bangladesh on Saturday, weakening from a severe cyclonic storm to a cyclonic storm. At least a dozen people had been confirmed killed in Bangladesh as the cyclone hovered over the country's southwestern coast early Saturday, delivering battering rain storms. Lightning killed at least six people, local newspapers and TV reported. However, the death toll had not increased by Saturday afternoon, suggesting effective preparedness in Bangladesh as well. \n\n    \n           Bad weather from the storm system was projected to affect around 100 million people in South Asia, from India's distant Andaman Islands to Mount Everest in Nepal. \n     The relatively low casualty count demonstrates much improved disaster readiness in India since 1999, when a \"super\" cyclone killed around 10,000 people and devastated large parts of Odisha. \"In the event of such a major calamity like this — where Odisha was hit by close to a super-cyclone — instead of being a tragedy of humongous proportion, we are in the process of restoring critical infrastructure. That is the transformation that Odisha has had,\" the state's top government official, Naveen Patnaik, said in a statement. India's disaster response agency said authorities were working \"on war footing\" to restore power and communications, and clear roads of debris. Widespread power outages, damaged water supplies and roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines made transport around the affected area difficult, officials said. Pravat Ranjan Mohapatra, the deputy relief commissioner at Odisha's emergency center, said his phone line and internet were down for most of Saturday. \"Earlier we were not able to connect with authorities for infrastructure damage, how many houses are damaged or how many people have died or were injured,\" he said. According to the Press Trust of India, one victim was a teenager killed by a falling tree in the district of Puri, a popular tourist area in Odisha. Another woman was killed while fetching water when she was struck by flying debris loosened from a concrete structure. Another woman, age 65, died after a suspected heart attack at a cyclone shelter, PTI reported.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/04/f01362e4-f004-44be-aa5b-60c271ae1b52/thumbnail/620x410/8d05d3ce5005d24cd04819ac3afe8c7a/gettyimages-1141065765.jpg#\" alt=\"TOPSHOT-INDIA-WEATHER-FANI-CYCLONE \" height=\"410\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/04/f01362e4-f004-44be-aa5b-60c271ae1b52/thumbnail/620x410/8d05d3ce5005d24cd04819ac3afe8c7a/gettyimages-1141065765.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/04/f01362e4-f004-44be-aa5b-60c271ae1b52/thumbnail/1240x820/b0fd6d353aa9e1265a28f57115ca7a0f/gettyimages-1141065765.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20410'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104014", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Cougar helicopter hurtled into a mountain outside Caracas in the early hours of an overcast day in the capital. An investigation was underway.  \n     The armed forces in a statement said the chopper was heading to San Carlos in Cojedes state. That's near a military academy where Maduro appeared early Saturday to oversee training exercises following a week of intrigue that saw a small group of security forces turn against him in the failed attempt by opposition leader Juan Guaidó to overthrow the government.  On board the helicopter were two lieutenant colonels as well as five lower-ranking officers. The statement didn't say if the chopper was part of the presidential delegation.  \n  \n  \n\n \n Also in Caracas on Saturday, a protester handed over a written appeal for the military's support, but a Venezuelan policeman burned the document and let the ashes fall to the ground.  \n\n           The armed forces \"won't be blackmailed or bought,\" said a second officer standing nearby.  Benito Rodriguez fumed as he watched the events unfold.  \"It's a humiliation,\" said Rodriguez, a demonstrator who had joined a crowd of about 150 protesters gathered near La Casona, a residence historically used by Venezuelan presidents.  \n     The scene highlights the uphill battle now facing opponents of Maduro who have failed to persuade the country's security forces to join efforts to oust the leader.  The critical role of the Venezuelan military in the country's crisis was on display as Maduro tried to portray strength by joining troops at the military academy, while Guaidó attempted to woo the armed forces to his side by urging supporters to the streets.  National television showed Maduro wearing a camouflage hat as he shook hands and exchanged fist bumps with security forces during a visit to a military base before watching troops engage in a shooting exercise.  \"Loyal forever,\" Maduro bellowed to a crowd of cadets in green uniforms.  Guaidó, meanwhile, told backers to go to military garrisons to persuade forces to turn against Maduro, whose years in office have been marked by escalating hardship for most people in a country that was once one of the wealthiest in Latin America.  As demonstrators linked arms and moved toward police, protest leader Maria Suarez urged calm.  \"Please, a lot of discipline,\" she said.  \n     Others broke the line and went forward to hand over printed documents, saying the military's role in helping Venezuela emerge from an \"unsustainable\" situation is vital.  \"They think it's a joke. They don't take us seriously. They're not listening,\" said demonstrator Andrea Palma after police burned the paper with a lighter.  Divisions among the protesters were evident as some young men from poor neighborhoods scoffed at a speaker who insisted that the gathering must be peaceful.  \"It's the frustration talking,\" said demonstrator Mariajose Molina.  The latest displays of will come as the political standoff between Maduro and U.S.-backed Guaidó sinks deeper into a stalemate.  On Tuesday, Guaidó appeared outside a Caracas military base urged the military to overthrow his political rival.  As the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly waited, however, it became clear that his call had failed to rally armed forces to his side. Clashes between protesters and police then erupted, leaving five dead.  \n     Maduro's government has also shown signs of weakness and has not moved to arrest Guaidó, who the United States and over 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela's rightful leader.  More than three million Venezuelans have left the country to escape a shrinking economy, hyperinflation and shortages of necessities such as medicine.  The opposition blames the sharp decline on state corruption, mismanagement and authoritarianism and says Maduro's re-  last year was illegitimate. Maduro portrays Venezuela as a victim of U.S. antagonism toward the socialist principles championed by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.  On Saturday, one protester looked on as the printed proclamation was burned. He then wished the policeman a nice day.  \"See you later,\" replied the officer before turning away. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg#\" alt=\"George Blake Holding Coat \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/1280x720/a959f53d248f6fb7dc4ddfff51e2e2b3/blake.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104015", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

At least eight Palestinians, including a pregnant woman and her 14-month-old niece, have also been killed. \n     Israeli forces struck dozens of targets throughout Gaza, including militant sites that it said were concealed in homes or residential areas. The army also moved armored units toward the Gaza perimeter as the sides headed closer to all-out war. Moshe Agadi, a 58-year-old Israeli father of four, was struck in the chest by shrapnel in a residential courtyard from one of the 450 rockets fired from Gaza in less than 24 hours. Then a midday barrage hit Ashkelon again, wounding three people, including two seriously who were suffering from \"multisystem trauma.\" The Magen David Adom rescue service said another person was critically wounded when a rocket landed on a car near the Gaza boundary. \n  \n  \n\n \n The Israeli military has retaliated with some 260 airstrikes against militant targets in Gaza. \n\n    \n           The Palestinian Health Ministry had previously said an Israeli strike on Saturday killed a pregnant woman, Falistin Abu Arar, 37, and her niece, Seba Abu Arar, in their east Gaza City home. However, military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said Sunday that a detailed review found that a Palestinian rocket had misfired and killed them. He said the Palestinians were \"trying to sell a story that isn't true.\" The conflicting accounts could not immediately be reconciled. Hospital officials in Gaza confirmed the deaths of two men, ages 28 and 21. Islamic Jihad media outlets said the two were militants. Their deaths raised to nine the number of Palestinians killed in the recent fighting. \n     The sudden outburst has broken a month-long lull as Egyptian mediators had been trying to negotiate a long-term cease-fire between the two sides, who have fought three wars and several other rounds of conflict over the past decade. Conricus said Israel's strikes hit a variety of \"high-quality\" militant sites, that included commanders' homes in which militant activity was observed. He said he had no knowledge of civilians being harmed by Israeli fire. The military spokesman said Israel was deploying an armored brigade along the Gaza front, with tanks ready for offensive missions as needed. The Israeli military has already struck rocket launchers, tunnel shafts, training sites, storage depots and warehouses of both the territory's Hamas rulers and the smaller, Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad group. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was paying a \"heavy price\" for its rocket attacks against Israel and that it would be held accountable not only for its own militant actions but also for that of the Islamic Jihad, which operates under its jurisdiction in Gaza. Sirens wailed along the border region overnight and throughout the day warning of incoming attacks. School was canceled in southern Israel and emergency protocol enacted. As the day progressed, rockets were being fired deeper into the Israeli heartland. In Gaza, large explosions thundered across the blockaded enclave during the night as plumes of smoke rose into the air. By morning, bulldozers were clearing the streets from rubble and debris strewn on the ground and municipal workers were fixing damaged power lines. Owners of clothing stores that were destroyed in Gaza City's relatively upscale Remal neighborhood squatted across the streets from where their stores had stood, cupping their faces in their hands. \n\n    \n           One of the airstrikes hit a six-story commercial and residential building that housed the office of Turkey's official Anadolu news agency. \n     \"We thought the Rimal neighborhood is safe, but it seems there is no safe place in Gaza,\" said Nidal al-Dali, who lived in the building and lost his home. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called it a \"new example of Israel's unrestrained aggression.\" The Israeli military says its Iron Dome defense system intercepted more than 150 of the projectiles from Gaza, but several still managed to slip through. A rocket scored a direct hit on a residential home in the border town of Sderot. Jonathan Rieck, director of the emergency room at Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon, said they had treated some 80 people, most from shock symptoms, but several with body wounds, including an elderly man who was in critical condition from head injuries. In a first, the hospital itself was also hit by debris from a rocket that was intercepted by an Iron Dome missile. There were no injuries. \n\n    \n           Israel has vowed to hit back hard against both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, whom it suspects of triggering the current conflagration. But, as in similar previous rounds where it stopped short of a full-fledged war, the timing for a prolonged round of fighting is tricky for Israel. The country marks Memorial Day and Independence Day this week. The following week it is set to host the Eurovision song contest in which large groups of tourists are expected to arrive for the festive event. For Gazans, the violence comes ahead of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan that begins Monday. \n     Hamas, an Islamic group vowed to Israel's destruction, forcefully seized control of Gaza in 2007. It most recently engaged in several days of heavy fighting with Israel in March before Egypt brokered a truce, in which Israel agreed to ease a crippling blockade on Gaza in exchange for a halt in rocket fire. In recent days, Hamas accused Israel of reneging on its pledges as militants began to fire rockets into Israel. Israel accuses Islamic Jihad of operating behind Hamas' back and instigating the latest round of violence by shooting and wounding two Israeli soldiers Friday. Two Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces the same day during the weekly protests along the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence. Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser, said the violence was being instigated by Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza at the behest of their backers in Iran. Amidror, currently a senior fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, said a new war in Gaza would distract Israel and leave Tehran \"free to continue what they are doing in Syria.\" The resurgence of violence threatened to shatter the shaky understandings recently reached though Egyptian mediators.

He also said they were in good position in the first two days of the pink-ball Test. “We had two good days but had just one bad hour where we lost completely. The talk in the dressing room was about backing ourselves as an individual and as a team and stick to the plan whatever it is,” he added on the eve of the second Test. However, Kohli’s departure weakened the Indian batting a bit in trouble and Rahane conceded that they would miss their skipper. There were suggestions to promote himself to No.4 but the middle-order batsman said they have not decided anything yet. “Openers role is crucial but I don’t want to put pressure on them. Just want to give them freedom to play. We will definitely miss Virat. When you have a player like him, it is great for the team.” \nIndia looked in a good position with Kohli and Rahane batting well in the first innings before Kohli was run out. Speaking about the incident, he revealed the momentum shifted in hosts’ favour. “It was a tough one. We were going really well. I saw the momentum going in Australia’s way after the run out. After the end of play, I said sorry to him (Kohli) and he was ok with it. He understood the situation. Such things happen and you have to respect that and move forward.” He further informed that Kohli had a message for the team before heading to India. “He spoke to all of us before leaving. We had a team dinner in Adelaide. He spoke about playing to our strength. We have been playing well. We have to help each other and enjoy each other’s success.” The bowling department will be without Mohammad Shami, who was injured and ruled out of the remainder of the series but the 32-year-old said they are capable of delivering the goods. “Bumrah is a quality bowler and he has been doing really well. Apart from that, Umesh (Yadav) and a guy who will play (Mohammad Siraj), it is about bowling in partnerships. We have discussed how to go about it. It is about bowling in partnerships and bowling towards the plan.” When asked about Australia coach Justin Langer’s comments where he said Indians were under stress after the loss, Rahane added, “Australians are very good at playing mind games. Let them do that. We are focusing on ourselves on what we need to do. We will back ourselves and be positive,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

The industry's hopes are also in line with expectations that the economy would finally come out of the slump, drawing people back to the showrooms. Yet, the challenges of transition to stricter emission norm BS-VI from BS-IV and compliance to new safety norms thereby making vehicles costlier are lurking around the sector. With India's flagship motor show the biennial Auto Expo round the corner, the auto sector is treating the show as the launching pad of revival, having been through an unprecedented slump, which began from the last festival season and continuing unabated till date. From two-wheelers to cars and heavy duty trucks, all segments of the sector were in the red. Such has been the impact of slowdown that the industry is expected to close 2019-20 with a decline of 13-17 per cent in wholesale dispatches as compared with last financial year. The steep drop in sales caused operational hardships for many companies and production plans had to be re-evaluated through the year. The sector, including dealerships and auto components, witnessed around 3.5 lakh people losing jobs due to the downturn. Despite hard times, all hope is not lost. Industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) expects things to turnaround in 2020-21. \"2020 will be an interesting year with BS-VI getting implemented and entirely new platforms being available in the market,\" SIAM President Rajan Wadhera told PTI. But what gives the industry hope? \"The Indian economy is expected to revive early next year, which along with the low base of last year and availability of newer models should support growth in the auto sector,\" Wadhera said. According to him, the sector is expected to start reviving from the second quarter of the next financial year but it will be visible from the third quarter of the fiscal. \"Implementation of BS-VI norms will mean clearing of all old inventory, building up new inventory and making available new BS-VI compliant vehicles in the market, which will give some upside to the production and sale,\" Wadhera noted. However, with vehicle cost going up by 8-10 per cent due to technology ramp up, industry fears that it could further lead volume loss. \"To get respite from this additional cost pressure, SIAM has submitted to the government to lower GST rate for vehicles to 18 per cent from 28 per cent and also introduce an incentive-based scrappage policy for vehicles,\" Wadhera said. Both these submissions, if implemented, will surely support quicker recovery for the auto sector, he added. Wadhera's optimism is shared by India's largest carmaker MD & CEO, Maruti Suzuki India Limited MD & CEO, Kenichi Ayukawa, who is also \"hopeful that 2020 will be a better year for us and industry and approach it with optimism\". Yet, Ayukawa has a note of caution. \"On way forward, it is really tough to predict the turnaround but the long term story for Indian automobile industry continues to be promising,\" he said. Expressing similar views, Hyundai Motor India MD and CEO S S Kim said,\"Probably after the BS-VI implementation, for few months the customer will need time to understand new norms and new situations. So, I would say demand will grow gradually from the second half of the next year.\" Honda Cars India President and CEO Gaku Nakanishi said that it appeared that the industry has already hit its bottom this year. \"We are not sure of the speed of recovery yet but the situation will improve in next fiscal. After market adjusts in BS-VI regime, we think that industry will gradually start recovering from next festive season,\" he noted. With BS-VI transition being the most immediate challenge, auto manufacturers have put their all as they get ready to be fully compliant by April 1, 2020. \"The investments towards the BS-VI transition has been the single largest investment for Tata Motors. We are ready with our BS-VI transition plan and our new BS-VI products will start rolling out from January 2020,\" Tata Motors CEO and MD Guenter Butschek said. In order to ensure there is no BS-IV stock left after March 31, 2020 automobile companies have already started aligning their productions accordingly. As for new products set to hit the market in 2020, the upcoming Auto Expo from February 5-12 will give a glimpse. \"The Auto Expo 2020 will be the launching pad for the revival of the auto industry, we feel,\" Wadhera said, adding the main attractions of the expo would be clean vehicles, keeping in mind the BS-VI norms besides electric, hybrid and connected vehicles. Tata Motor's Nexon EV and MG Motor's ZS EV are set to hit the roads soon to follow the footsteps of Hyundai's Kona that has already found takers. In all, over 60 new launches and unveilings of vehicles are expected at the expo where China's Great Wall Motor Company and First Automotive Works (FAW) will make their debut along with MG Motors India. Holding the flag up for the industry at the motor show would be the likes of Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, M&M, Tata Motors and Kia along with Skoda and Volkswagen brands, which are making a comeback after skipping the 2018 edition. However, the slowdown witnessed by the auto sector in the past five successive quarters has had an impact on participation. Notable absentees are Honda, Toyota, Ford, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover along two-wheeler majors Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co. The industry, during the current fiscal, witnessed successful debut of Kia Motors and MG Motor with their initial models hitting the bulls eye.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104015", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Researchers at Queen's University Belfast in UK, along with colleagues at the University of Liverpool and other international partners, invented the new liquid and found that it can dissolve unusually large amount of gas, which are absorbed into the `holes' in the liquid. The research could pave the way for many more efficient and greener chemical processes, including the procedure known as carbon capture -trapping carbon dioxide from major sources, for example a fossil-fuel power plant, and storing it to prevent its entry into the atmosphere. \"Materials which contain permanent holes, or pores, are technologically important. They are used for manufacturing a range of products from plastic bottles to petrol,\" said Stuart James of Queen's School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. \"However, until recently, these porous materials have been solids. What we have done is to design a special liquid from the 'bottom-up' -we designed the shapes of the molecules which make up the liquid so that the liquid could not fill up all the space,\" James said. \"Because of the empty holes we then had in the liquid, we found that it was able to dissolve unusually large amounts of gas,\" he said. \"A few more years' research will be needed, but if we can find applications for these porous liquids they could result in new or improved chemical processes,\" James said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104014", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

This \"digital patch\" is the first new effective treatment for lazy eye in half a century, researchers from the Glick Eye Institute at Indiana University said. Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, remains the most common cause of visual impairment in children. Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not develop normally during early childhood. This can occur when one eye is much more nearsighted than the other, or when one eye wanders or strays inward. The child needs to receive treatment by the age of 8 or so while their eyes and brain are still developing, or he or she could become blind in the weaker eye. A recent study found that 1 in 4 kids feel anxiety before using eye drops. Nearly 15 percent refuse to take eye drops at all. Both drops and eye patches work based on the occlusion method. This blocks vision in the eye with the best sight, forcing the brain to rely on the so-called lazy eye. During the process, vision improves though many children will still need glasses to correct their eyesight. In comparison, the electronic glasses used in the study combine vision correction and occlusion. The lenses can be filled to a child's vision prescription. Because the lenses are liquid crystal display (LCD), they can also be programmed to turn opaque, occluding vision in the left or right eye for different time intervals, acting like a digital patch that flickers on and off. Researchers recently tested the effectiveness of occlusion glasses compared to patching in a randomised clinical study. They recruited 33 subjects with lazy eye between age 3 and 8 who wore spectacles to correct their vision. One group wore an adhesive patch for two hours daily. The other wore Amblyz occlusion glasses for 4 hours daily. In the study, the lens over the eye with better vision switched from clear to opaque every 30 seconds. After three months, both groups of children showed the same amount of improvement in the lazy eye, gaining two lines on a reading chart. \"When you talk to adults who underwent childhood treatment for amblyopia, they will tell you that wearing a patch was the worst thing ever,\" said Daniel Neely, a paediatric ophthalmology professor at Indiana University who led the study. \"With these electronic occlusion glasses, the child learns that the lens will be clear again in just a few seconds so they may be more cooperative with the treatment. For parents who have struggled with drops and patching, this could be a great alternative,\" said Neely.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104015", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing.

However, the full extent of the damage was yet to be known, officials said Saturday. \n     The cyclone packed winds of 155 miles per hour when it made landfall in eastern Odisha state on Friday, equivalent in strength to a Category 4 hurricane, said Mohammad Heidarzadei, an expert on cyclones at Brunel University of London. As of late Saturday, India's National Disaster Response Force director S.N. Pradhan said three people had been killed, though the storm smashed thatched-roof huts, uprooted trees and power lines, ripped the roof off a medical college and sprayed the emptied coastline with debris. \"The precautions that have been taken should be continued,\" Pradhan said. \n  \n  \n\n \n Officials cautioned that the death toll could rise as communications were restored. Fani crossed over India's West Bengal state and moved northeast toward Bangladesh on Saturday, weakening from a severe cyclonic storm to a cyclonic storm. At least a dozen people had been confirmed killed in Bangladesh as the cyclone hovered over the country's southwestern coast early Saturday, delivering battering rain storms. Lightning killed at least six people, local newspapers and TV reported. However, the death toll had not increased by Saturday afternoon, suggesting effective preparedness in Bangladesh as well. \n\n    \n           Bad weather from the storm system was projected to affect around 100 million people in South Asia, from India's distant Andaman Islands to Mount Everest in Nepal. \n     The relatively low casualty count demonstrates much improved disaster readiness in India since 1999, when a \"super\" cyclone killed around 10,000 people and devastated large parts of Odisha. \"In the event of such a major calamity like this — where Odisha was hit by close to a super-cyclone — instead of being a tragedy of humongous proportion, we are in the process of restoring critical infrastructure. That is the transformation that Odisha has had,\" the state's top government official, Naveen Patnaik, said in a statement. India's disaster response agency said authorities were working \"on war footing\" to restore power and communications, and clear roads of debris. Widespread power outages, damaged water supplies and roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines made transport around the affected area difficult, officials said. Pravat Ranjan Mohapatra, the deputy relief commissioner at Odisha's emergency center, said his phone line and internet were down for most of Saturday. \"Earlier we were not able to connect with authorities for infrastructure damage, how many houses are damaged or how many people have died or were injured,\" he said.

However, the experienced coach Manolo Marquez Roca feels the result will not affect their morale going into their next match against Kerala Blasters. Speaking on the eve of their ISL clash against strugglers Kerala, who are placed at ninth without a win yet, the Spaniard felt Mumbai City FC were a strong team and they were good on the day. “In football, there are three possibilities: win, draw or loss. It is impossible to maintain only one. After losing one game, no team becomes bad. I think the loss against Mumbai does not affect our team for tomorrow’s game. We will go out to play a good game and win tomorrow,” he said. On being asked about the loss against strong opponents Mumbai and not converting the chances, he said, “I don’t think we created too many chances. I only remember one clear chance from (Mohammad) Yasir one minute before the half time. With the equaliser, the second half would have been different. But with a young and inexperienced side, I am happy with the way they played in the second half.” Speaking about their opponents Kerala Blasters, he rated the team very high on talent. “For me it is a very good team. They played an open game in the championship against ATK and they didn’t deserve to lose. In the last game, they equalised in injury time. They have got good players and they deserve more points than what they have now. For sure it will be a tough battle,” he added. When asked about major changes in the upcoming game, he said he does not believe in changing the team because of one loss. “There are a few areas from the Mumbai game where we can improve and change some players maybe. We are not going to make too many tactical changes and we played six games and had only one loss. Can’t change too many things.” He said talented Indian player Nikhil Poojary will be out of this game owing to injuries. “You don’t win games on revealing who is playing or not. For me, the squad is of 29 players and 28 players were training and only one player was out with injury. All other players are in the contention for a place. Only Nikhil is not in the reckoning because of injury,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the recent passing away of Siraj’s father, the celebrations were muted and confined to indoors. But the family members of the fast bowler, who made his Test debut against Australia on Saturday, were excited while they followed the game on the television. The moment Siraj took to the field with his teammates, his mother Shabana Begum’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. Speaking after watching his son don Indian colours, she said her husband’s (Mohammed Ghouse) dream finally fulfilled. “  (It is all the grace of Almighty). Thanks to God, his father would be proud of him today,” she said. When asked about their feeling ahead of his debut, she said, “We got up very early to watch him play. We were excited and happy. But when he took the field and stood there with his teammates singing the national anthem, it brought us tears.” Siraj had a wonderful debut picking up two crucial wickets that helped India skittle out Australia for 195 runs on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. When asked about their feeling after Siraj picked up his first wicket, Shabana said, “We can’t express the feeling. Playing for country has always been his and his father’s dream. Now he made the country proud.” Shabana, who was worried for Siraj for neglecting his studies and focusing on cricket, added she wants her son to win matches for India. Siraj’s grandmother Sardar Bhi said that the family was delighted. “Due to his father’s death, the family mourning will continue for three months. So we told Siraj’s friends not to come to the house for watching the match. We know they are all excited to share their joy with us. But this is a tough time.” “We started getting calls early in the morning when he took those two wickets. We switched off our mobiles and kept it aside to watch the match,” she added. Siraj’s brother Mohammed Ismail said he was over the moon. “I wasn’t feeling well in the morning, so I watched till lunch and slept off. But I have been receiving calls from people congratulating us. It is a great moment for our family,” he added. A long time friend of Siraj, Mohd Shafi said that he is poised for greater things. “I am very happy to see Siraj playing for the country. If his father was here, he would have been very happy. I spoke to his mother, she was also very happy. I spoke to Siraj as well after the first day’s game. He said if people support him, he would do many great things for the country.

While their use of the gesture may have been intended as innocent enthusiasm, the hand signal has been co-opted by supporters of white supremacy. Helme made the \"heated woman\" remark a news conference where he also accused Estonian news outlets of applying a double standard in covering abuse allegations against the now-former minister from his own far-right Estonian Conservative People's Party, or ERKE. \n  \n  \n\n \n President Kersti Kaljulaid, the first woman to serve as the Baltic country's head of state, left a Monday swearing-in ceremony for a new three-party government when it was time for the appointee at issue to take the oath of office. Marti Kuusik was sworn in as technology and foreign trade minister along with the rest of Prime Minister Juri Ratas' Cabinet after news reports featured the domestic violence allegations. Police opened an investigation to review the allegations hours later. Kuusik, a member of Helme's ERKE party, resigned the next day, saying the probe was based on \"slander\" and \"a terrifying media attack\" against him. Helme called the reporting \"an unconstitutional witch hunt.\" He also made clear his dim view of the president's decision to walk out during the ceremony and return to her seat when it was the next minister's turn. \n     \"An emotionally heated woman can afford to do that,\" Helme told reporters. \"But Kersti Kaljulaid is not simply a woman, but the president of the republic.\" \"She reads one article, becomes so emotionally upset as a woman that she makes a decision right away,\" he added. Kaljulaid, who has been president since October 2016, did not respond Thursday to Helme's comments. Helme and his son, newly appointed Finance Minister Martin Helme, have accused the news media before of displaying a negative bias toward the Estonian Conservative People's Party, or ERKE. The party has advocated abolishing legal recognition for same-sex civil unions, demanded changes to the abortion law and fiercely opposed European Union quotas for taking in asylum-seekers. Photographs of the two flashing the OK hand sign at Monday's swearing-in ceremony have received attention from other politicians. The use of the familiar gesture by some extreme-right activists and white supremacists has given it an alternative meaning. \n\n    \n           Mart Helme hasn't responded to questions about his and his son's hand motions, but his son told   just an hour before throwing up both hands in OK gestures after he was sworn in earlier this week that, \"No one will tell us what words we can say or what signs we can make.\"  \n     The country's former President Toomas Hendrik Ilves posted a tweet on Monday with photos of both Helmes giving the signal, accusing them of doing so with nefarious intent. \n Former Swedish top diplomat Carl Bildt said he was also \"genuinely worried\" about the public display as he  . Martin Helme, who told Politico that U.S. President Donald Trump was \"absolutely\" an inspiration to him, has been quoted previously as calling for a \"white Estonia.\" \"Our immigration policy should have one simple rule: if you're black, go back. As simple as that,\" he said in 2013  . The OK hand signal gained popularity in 2017 as an inside joke among white supremacists online, who wrote about tricking liberals and the media into thinking the popular OK gesture had been co-opted by far-right groups, according to the  . But the joke eventually turned serious as white supremacists groups and figures, such as Richard Spencer in the U.S., continued to pose with it in photos and spread its use on social media. EKRE entered Estonia's parliament in 2015. It emerged from the country's March 3   with 17.8% of the vote to become the third-largest party in the national legislature. A party member is the current parliament speaker.

Orion's thermal protection system is one of the most critical parts of the spacecraft intended to facilitate human exploration of asteroids and of Mars. It consists of the spacecraft's main heat shield that faces into the atmosphere on reentry to slow the spaceship down and also the grid of tiles known as the back shell. During Orion's next mission atop the agency's Space Launch System rocket, called Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the spacecraft will be in space for more than three weeks and return to Earth under even faster and hotter conditions than during its last flight. \"As we move towards building the system for EM-1, we've been able to take advantage of what we learned from building and flying Orion to refine our processes going forward,\" said John Kowal, NASA's thermal protection system lead for Orion. During EM-1, Orion will endure a more intense re-entry environment. While the spacecraft encountered speeds of 30,000 feet per second during Exploration Flight Test-1 and temperatures of approximately 2,204 degrees Celsius, it will experience a faster return from lunar velocity of about 36,000 feet per second. The speed difference may seem subtle, but the heating the vehicle sees increases exponentially as the speed increases. Engineering teams are preparing Orion's heat shield to perform re-entry during any of missions planned near the Moon or in high lunar orbit in the coming years. For these future Orion missions, a silver, metallic-based thermal control coating will be bonded to the crew module's thermal protection system back shell tiles. The coating, similar to what is used on the main heat shield, will reduce heat loss during phases when Orion is pointed to space and therefore experiencing cold temperatures, as well as limit the high temperatures the crew module will be subjected to when the spacecraft faces the Sun. The coating will help Orion's back shell maintain a temperature range from approximately minus 101 to 287 degrees Celsius prior to entry and also will protect against electrical surface charges in space and during re-entry. Engineers have also refined the design in ways that improve the manufacturing process and reduce the mass of the spacecraft for the upcoming exploration missions. Instead of a monolithic outer layer, the heat shield will be made of about 180 blocks that can be made simultaneously with the other heat shield components to streamline the labour-and-time-intensive manufacturing process. In addition, engineers have found ways to reduce the mass of the heat shield's underlying structure, which is composed of a titanium skeleton and carbon fiber skin. Teams have optimised the thickness of the skeleton and the skin based on the pressures that different areas will experience during flight and reentry, adding more fidelity to the overall structure while allowing it to be lighter.

There are now more than 50 facilities around the world that are categorized as \"Level 4\" labs, which contain the deadliest pathogens and require the highest level of safety, and thousands more are designated \"Level 3\" facilities that contain infectious agents or toxins that may cause potentially lethal infection. While it is   that Covid-19 emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, the pandemic has raised the specter of a possible leak or act of bioterrorism. Containment facilities are an Achilles heel in biosecurity, and these labs, along with those who work there, should be subject to greater international scrutiny.  We also face additional biosecurity threats, now that advances in technology mean that many civilian research projects in medicine have the potential to be used in military applications. Controversial experiments in synthetic biology, including the synthesis of polio virus from its genetic sequence, and the modification of H5N1 for airborne transmission in mammals, have also led to calls for tighter controls on the materials and information used to engineer these pathogens. We must not ignore the threat of bad actors gaining access to these dangerous pathogens, which are the ultimate terror weapons, due to their potentially massive impact.

The next wave of growth could come from increasing exports to large and traditionally under penetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Latin America, which would help the industry meet its aspiration of becoming the world's largest supplier by volume, according to pharma industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). Experts said improved access to medicines in India and exploring new markets while maintaining thrust in the US will help the country's pharma industry to record double-digit growth in the coming year. However, the sector, specially pharmaceuticals, will be up against headwinds of increased costs related to regulatory compliances, particularly for the US market, price controls across markets and mandatory genericisation in India. \"The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is a sunrise industry with a competitive advantage for India. We should leverage India's position by unleashing entrepreneurial spirit through policy stability and ecosystem,\" IPA Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said. The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily.

Her skeletal remains provided scientists with invaluable information regarding the human race and its evolution, and Google is celebrating this day with a Doodle. Lucy Australopithecus has been proven to have lived around 3.2 million years ago in Ehtiopia. The Google Doodle dedicated to her today shows three stages of Lucy's evolution. Currently, Lucy's bones are kept in a museum in Ethiopia. Here's more about our ancestor Lucy: 1) 'Lucy' was the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton ever found. Australopithecus afarensis is a species that shares both human and ape characteristics that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. Around 40 per cent of Lucy's remains were discovered intact. 2) Do you know who named her Lucy? Paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson named the fossils Lucy after the Beatles song ' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.' 3) Lucy is a crucial stepping stone between apes and Homo Sapiens. It was exactly 41 years ago from today when the oldest known example of a bipedal primate came into the knowledge of humans. 4) Lucy had numerous similarities with chimpanzees.The skeleton revealed that she mostly walked upright. Bipedalism, walking using two rear limbs or legs, is a key distinction between Homo Sapiens and chimpanzees. 5) According to  , with a mixture of ape and human features - including long dangling arms with pelvic, spine, foot, and leg bones suited to walking upright - slender Lucy stood three-and-a-half feet tall. 6) Lucy is determined as a female due to her size. Fossils that were discovered later were larger in size and were identified as males. 7) Lucy was fully grown, for her wisdom teeth were very human-like. They were exposed and had been in use for a while before her death.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://images.catchnews.com/uploads/images/2015/11/24/lucy-skeleton.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy_Skeleton.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104018", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Hashim, who died in an attack on the Shangri-La hotel on April 21, inspired wealthy brothers Ilham Ibrahim and Inshaf Ibrahim to join and bankroll his assault, police and fellow Muslims said. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"We suspect the two brothers used their money from the spice business to finance the bombings,\" one police investigator said. \"It seems the indoctrination was via the internet -- Facebook and YouTube.\" \n\n           Neighbors of the Ibrahim brothers said they were secretive but devout Muslims. They were not active members of a congregation, community leaders said. \"We believe Zahran radicalized these people using Facebook,\" said R. Abdul Razik, a leader of the moderate Ceylon Thowheed Jama'ath (CTJ) group. \"Especially in the past year, he has been openly calling for the killing of non-Muslims.\" Investigators and community leaders believe the group also used social media private messaging apps to keep in touch without being noticed by the authorities. \n     The CTJ and the main body of Islamic clerics, the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, had alerted Sri Lanka's security establishment to Hashim and his acolytes, but said their warnings failed to get serious attention. The Sri Lankan government has already acknowledged that foreign intelligence warnings about the attacks were not passed on to ministers. \"We asked the intelligence agencies to take down the Facebook page of Zahran because he was polluting the minds of Sri Lankan Muslims,\" Razik said. \"We were told it is better to allow him to have the page so that the authorities could keep an eye on what he was doing.\" \n\n           Another moderate Islamic group, the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jama'ath (SLTJ) said it called a press conference in 2017 to warn authorities about Hashim, but no action was taken. \"Zahran indoctrinated people using social media. He was spewing an IS (ISIS) brand of propaganda that somehow appealed to the bombers,\" SLTJ spokesman Thawseef Ahamed told AFP. A fuller reckoning of those involved in the attacks was only released by authorities this week, revealing at least two sets of brothers. Ilham Ibrahim died at the Shangri-La hotel while his brother Inshaf Ibrahim bombed the Cinnamon Grand. \n     Ringleader Hashim also died at the Shangri-la, while his yet-to-be named brother blew himself up when surrounded on April 26 near the eastern coastal town of Kalmunai. He was with three widows of the Easter bombers when police and troops laid siege to the house. Sixteen people were killed there, including six children, relatives of Hashim, and members of his National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ) movement, which has since been banned. The pregnant wife of Ilham Ibrahim, Fathima Ilham, blew herself up when police raided the family home in Colombo hours after the bombings. She also killed her two children and three police officers. Mohamed Azzam Mubarak Mohamed has been named as the bomber who targeted the Kingsbury hotel in Colombo. His wife is now in police custody. A fourth hotel was on the bombers' list. The would-be attacker, Abdul Latheef, failed to set off his explosives. He detonated it a few hours later at a small motel, killing himself and two other people. Latheef studied aeronautical engineering at Kingston University in Britain and did post-graduate studies in Melbourne, Australia.

But as faith leaders who know Warnock, we can't allow the attacks on his beliefs to go unchallenged. The attacks on his faith are really attacks on the prophetic Black church tradition embodied by King and the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Almost every line of attack against Warnock could have been just as easily directed against King -- and often was.  As religious leaders, we can't help but notice that Loeffler did not attack the faith of her Republican primary opponent, Rep.

Soon after, a local television station   riding on the back of a golf cart as he toured the grounds. \n     It wasn't clear why he was there, but Friday, Caliburn International confirmed to CBS News that Kelly had joined its board of directors. Caliburn is the parent company of Comprehensive Health Services, which operates Homestead and three other shelters for unaccompanied migrant children in Texas.  Prior to joining the   in January 2017, Kelly had been on the board of advisors of DC Capital Partners, an investment firm that now owns Caliburn. \n  \n  \n\n \n The Caliburn board includes other former high-ranking military personnel, including retired General Anthony C. Zinni, Admiral James G. Stavridis and Rear Admiral Kathleen Martin. The company's portfolio includes work in a variety of defense sectors. \n\n    \n           \"With four decades of military and humanitarian leadership, in-depth understanding of international affairs and knowledge of current economic drivers around the world, General Kelly is a strong strategic addition to our team,\" said James Van Dusen, Caliburn's CEO. \"Our board remains acutely focused on advising on the safety and welfare of unaccompanied minors who have been entrusted to our care and custody by the Department of Health and Human Services to address a very urgent need in caring for and helping to find appropriate sponsors for these unaccompanied minors.\" Kelly joined DC Capital's board in February 2016 and stepped down in January 2017 when he was confirmed as Secretary of Homeland Security. Kelly switched jobs in July 2017 to become President Trump's chief of staff, a position he  . During Kelly's tenure, the administration pursued ambitious changes to immigration enforcement, and the average length of stay for an unaccompanied migrant child in U.S. custody skyrocketed.  \n     In the past year, Comprehensive Health Services, the only private company operating shelters, became one of the most dominant players in the industry. Last August, it secured three licenses for facilities in Texas, totaling 500 beds, and in December, the Homestead facility began   from a capacity of 1,250 beds to 3,200.  Located on several acres of federal land adjacent to an Air Reserve Base, the facility is the nation's only site  .  Teens sleep in bunk-bed-lined dorm rooms, ranging in size from small rooms that fit 12 younger children to enormous halls shared by as many as 200 17-year-old boys, in rows of beds about shoulder-width apart. During a tour in February, a program coordinator told CBS News that the older children prefer the cavernous digs. \"They say it's like a slumber party,\" she said. The days begin at 6 a.m. and follow a strict schedule, as children proceed in single-file lines from building to building, supervised by a staff of more than 2,300.  Under a federal court agreement known as the Flores settlement, unaccompanied migrant children are supposed to be housed in \"non-secure\" facilities, which means the children cannot be prevented from coming and going as they please. The facility's administrator said that is technically the case in Homestead, but acknowledged that the facility is surrounded by a tall covered fence and monitored by a large team of private security contractors. The heavy security is one of a slew of issues repeatedly raised by lawyers tasked with monitoring compliance with Flores. They flagged Homestead, as well as a dozen other facilities, in a Dec. 31 letter to the Department of Justice outlining what they say are violations of the agreement.  \n     Last October, Caliburn filed paperwork with regulators announcing an IPO, but cancelled those plans in March. On April 14,   that DC Capital was instead seeking to sell 75 percent of the company. The company did not comment on the reported sale offer. Federal contract records show Comprehensive received at least $222 million to operate Homestead between July 7, 2018 and April 20, 2019, and could receive much more — up to $341 million in payments between now and November for continued operation of the expanded site. While Comprehensive and DC Capital appear to have reaped financial benefits through government contracts during and after Kelly's tenure as White House chief of staff, Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor, said Kelly may not have broken any rules. \"It sounds like he's running between the raindrops. It doesn't sound great, but most likely he's not directly violating any policies,\" Briffault told CBS News. Briffault said government officials are barred from benefiting from their involvement in matters that involve specific parties, meaning that while serving at the White House, Kelly could not directly influence any decision to award a contract to a DC Capital company. Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, said her first question would be to ask whether Kelly ever consulted ethics officials about any involvement in formulating any policies surrounding unaccompanied minors. \"The fact is that when he was in the White House, the government took action that swelled the population of people that were in these facilities, and that benefited his former employer.

Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said the current slowdown in exports is mainly due to a decline in petroleum products, which constitute 13.42 per cent of overall outward shipments. This decline, he said, is mainly on account of fall in petroleum prices which has driven the export value downwards. However, \"the positive growth in the exports of non-conventional commodity groups like electronic goods, drugs, and pharmaceuticals, organic and inorganic chemicals, augurs well for future growth,\" he told PTI. India's export growth is in the negative zone since August 2019 due to a steep fall in shipments of key sectors like petroleum, engineering and gems and jewellery. Labour-intensive sectors such as carpets, ready-made garments, handloom and leather too are recording decline in export growth. As per the World Trade Organization (WTO), global merchandise trade volumes are expected to rise by only 1.2 per cent in 2019, substantially slower than the 2.6 per cent growth forecast in April 2019. However in 2020, the growth in trade volume is projected to accelerate to 2.7 per cent. Apex exporters body Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said the global situation is becoming extremely challenging as rising protectionism is leading to uncertainty. FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai said the global situation is likely to improve in the first half of 2020, which would have a positive impact on India's exports. \"If the global situation improves, which is likely in the first half of 2020, we may look for 15 per cent growth in exports in the next financial year (2020-21). Exports will come out of negative zone next year but the rate of growth will not be in double digits,\" he said. He added that the order book position of Indian exporters is encouraging and less volatility in the domestic currency has also been a positive factor for traders. Sahai also said that Indian exports have to be aligned with changing import patterns of the global economy as 50 per cent of the world imports today is accounted by electrical and electronics products, automobiles, machinery, petroleum products and plastic items. \"While employment-intensive sectors should be pushed in exports, the new strategy should focus on technology-driven sectors,\" he said. Sharing similar views, Professor Rakesh Mohan Joshi from the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) said the steps taken by the government would help exports record growth in 2020. \"There is a need to take structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of Indian products in the global markets,\" Joshi said. The commerce ministry is considering several steps such as the announcement of the new WTO-compliant export incentive scheme and the new foreign trade policy for the next five years in 2020 to push the country's exports. The ministry has conducted a series of meetings with concerned stakeholders to finalise the foreign trade policy. On the trade front, India has been negotiating the mega free trade agreement RCEP  (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) since 2013. But in November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will not join the RCEP deal as negotiations failed to satisfactorily address New Delhi's \"outstanding issues and concerns\". Since January this year, exports have recorded a low rate of growth and slipped into the negative zone in August. During April-November 2019-20, the country's exports contracted by 2 per cent to USD 212 billion. Going by the current trend, FIEO has estimated that the exports may stand at USD 330-340 billion in the current fiscal. In 2018-19, the exports grew by 9 per cent to USD 331 billion from USD 303.5 billion in 2017-18. Since 2011-12, India's exports have been hovering at around USD 300 billion.

Lam was able to deliver the annual address more than an hour later by video, but the hostile reception inside the Legislative Council marked a slap in the face for the embattled chief executive grappling with anti-government protests now in their fifth month. When Lam started delivering the speech, she was shouted down by chanting pro-democracy lawmakers who held aloft placards showing her waving with hands colored blood-red. They also used a projector to light up Lam’s face and the wall behind her with protesters’ key demands. Lam left the chamber and then came back about 20 minutes later to try again, only to be met with further fury. One legislator brandishing a placard climbed onto a desk. Again, the council president stopped the session and Lam left. One lawmaker wearing a paper mask showing the face of Chinese President Xi Jinping tossed a placard as Lam walked out. Finally, 75 minutes after the previously scheduled start of the lengthy address, Lam delivered it via video link, with China’s yellow-starred red flag to her right and Hong Kong’s flag on her left. Describing the semi-autonomous Chinese territory as going through “major crisis,” Lam said: “People are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal?” She appealed for its 7.5 million citizens to “cherish the city,” warning that “continued violence and spread of hatred will erode the core values of Hong Kong.” Standing ramrod-straight, she then launched into a dry and detailed explanation of plans to tackle Hong Kong’s shortage of affordable housing, a long-standing source of discontent, and other welfare issues. With its focus on such minutiae as building new tunnels and freeing up land for development, the 50-minute speech titled “Treasure Hong Kong our home” only fueled criticism that Lam is deaf to protesters’ concerns about the future of the territory’s freedoms, unique in China. In a subsequent news conference, Lam again made clear that she wouldn’t resign and insisted there has been no erosion “whatsoever” of Hong Kong’s freedoms. “Hong Kong is still a very free society,” she said. Even before Lam delivered her speech, one of the protesting lawmakers, Claudia Mo, dismissed it as a “shame and a sham” and said the chief executive had lost all authority. “She is just a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing,” Mo said at an impromptu news conference with other lawmakers outside the chamber after they successfully thwarted Lam’s address there. They played a recording on a small loudspeaker they said was the sound of police tear-gassing protesters and of protesters’ wails. “These are the voices of people screaming and they are just ordinary Hong Kong people,” said lawmaker Tanya Chan. “Please, please, please Mrs. Carrie Lam, don’t let us suffer any more.” She and others called for Lam’s resignation. “This is the only way that we can have a good future,” said Chan. Pro-Beijing legislators condemned the disruption, among them Martin Liao, who called it “totally unforgivable.” Lam had been bracing for trouble in the chamber as her government battles the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have snowballed into a sustained anti-government, anti-police and anti-China movement. The widespread use of tear gas by riot-control squads and 2,600 arrests, widely decried as heavy handed, have triggered public disgust with the 30,000-strong police force once considered among Asia’s finest. Hardcore black-clad and masked protesters have responded with widespread vandalism of China-linked businesses, subway stations and other targets, and attacked police with gasoline bombs and other weapons. This month, two police shootings that injured teenage protesters, the stabbing of a police officer, and the detonation of a small, remote-controlled bomb close to police officers ratcheted up violence to levels unprecedented since the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. Saying rioters are “spreading chaos and fear,” Lam appealed for order and sought to end her address on a positive note. Her Facebook profile was updated before she spoke, with a photo of a smiling Lam against a backdrop of a rainbow over Hong Kong’s harbor. “We have to put aside differences and stop attacking each other,” she said. “I thoroughly believe that Hong Kong will be able to ride out this storm and move on.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104019", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

With results in from more than two-thirds of the 259 local authorities up for grabs, the governing Conservatives had lost more than 700 seats. The left-of-center opposition Labour Party, which had hoped to increase its tally of local councilors, lost 87. \n     The Conservatives had previously held about 60 percent of the more than 8,000 seats being contested across England and Northern Ireland.   are not being held in London, Scotland or Wales.

He said voters' mood was \"almost anti-political ... I think they want to punish us for a lack of action in government.\" \n     Many Labour members blamed the party's poor showing on its ambivalent position on Brexit. The party supports the decision to leave the bloc - to the frustration of many Labour members and lawmakers, who are largely pro-EU - but opposes May's divorce deal. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said voters' message \"seems to be 'a plague on both your houses' to the Conservatives and the Labour Party, who they see as a block on finding some sort of resolution to Brexit.\" The biggest surge in votes went to the centrist, pro-EU Liberal Democrats, who gained more than 400 council seats. The Green Party, which is also against exiting the EU, and independents running on local issues also made gains. \"Voters have sent a clear message that they no longer have confidence in the Conservatives, but they are also refusing to reward Labour while the party prevaricates on the big issue of the day: Brexit,\" said Lib Dem leader Vince Cable. \n\n    \n           The Conservatives and Labour are bracing for even worse results in European Parliament elections in three weeks. Britain was due to have left the EU well before the European vote, but the departure has been delayed until Oct. 31 because Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to get Parliament's backing for her divorce deal with the EU. In those European elections on May 23, the main parties face additional opposition from new forces on the political scene - the anti-EU Brexit Party and the pro-European Change UK.

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104020", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Hashim, who died in an attack on the Shangri-La hotel on April 21, inspired wealthy brothers Ilham Ibrahim and Inshaf Ibrahim to join and bankroll his assault, police and fellow Muslims said. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"We suspect the two brothers used their money from the spice business to finance the bombings,\" one police investigator said. \"It seems the indoctrination was via the internet -- Facebook and YouTube.\" \n\n           Neighbors of the Ibrahim brothers said they were secretive but devout Muslims. They were not active members of a congregation, community leaders said. \"We believe Zahran radicalized these people using Facebook,\" said R. Abdul Razik, a leader of the moderate Ceylon Thowheed Jama'ath (CTJ) group. \"Especially in the past year, he has been openly calling for the killing of non-Muslims.\" Investigators and community leaders believe the group also used social media private messaging apps to keep in touch without being noticed by the authorities. \n     The CTJ and the main body of Islamic clerics, the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, had alerted Sri Lanka's security establishment to Hashim and his acolytes, but said their warnings failed to get serious attention. The Sri Lankan government has already acknowledged that foreign intelligence warnings about the attacks were not passed on to ministers. \"We asked the intelligence agencies to take down the Facebook page of Zahran because he was polluting the minds of Sri Lankan Muslims,\" Razik said. \"We were told it is better to allow him to have the page so that the authorities could keep an eye on what he was doing.\" \n\n           Another moderate Islamic group, the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jama'ath (SLTJ) said it called a press conference in 2017 to warn authorities about Hashim, but no action was taken. \"Zahran indoctrinated people using social media. He was spewing an IS (ISIS) brand of propaganda that somehow appealed to the bombers,\" SLTJ spokesman Thawseef Ahamed told AFP. A fuller reckoning of those involved in the attacks was only released by authorities this week, revealing at least two sets of brothers. Ilham Ibrahim died at the Shangri-La hotel while his brother Inshaf Ibrahim bombed the Cinnamon Grand. \n     Ringleader Hashim also died at the Shangri-la, while his yet-to-be named brother blew himself up when surrounded on April 26 near the eastern coastal town of Kalmunai. He was with three widows of the Easter bombers when police and troops laid siege to the house. Sixteen people were killed there, including six children, relatives of Hashim, and members of his National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ) movement, which has since been banned. The pregnant wife of Ilham Ibrahim, Fathima Ilham, blew herself up when police raided the family home in Colombo hours after the bombings. She also killed her two children and three police officers. Mohamed Azzam Mubarak Mohamed has been named as the bomber who targeted the Kingsbury hotel in Colombo. His wife is now in police custody. A fourth hotel was on the bombers' list. The would-be attacker, Abdul Latheef, failed to set off his explosives. He detonated it a few hours later at a small motel, killing himself and two other people. Latheef studied aeronautical engineering at Kingston University in Britain and did post-graduate studies in Melbourne, Australia. Australian media said he was under investigation in 2014 by the country's counter-terrorism unit and may have travelled to Syria. He also came into contact with Hashim through Facebook posts and YouTube videos. \n     The men who bombed the three churches have been named as Ahmed Muaz, Mohamed Hasthun and Mohamed Nasser Mohamed Asad. The three were hardly known within their communities, according to Muslim leaders.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/03/090d88d4-581d-442b-a4bf-777969d980a6/thumbnail/620x413/237c2a4012b04c1aeb8d5758a521f17c/sri-lanka-bombings-1140776997.jpg#\" alt=\"Eastern Sri Lanka On The Edge After Easter Bombings \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/03/090d88d4-581d-442b-a4bf-777969d980a6/thumbnail/620x413/237c2a4012b04c1aeb8d5758a521f17c/sri-lanka-bombings-1140776997.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/03/090d88d4-581d-442b-a4bf-777969d980a6/thumbnail/1240x826/94d462ff64eb6f84c87f8600d3d932f5/sri-lanka-bombings-1140776997.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104020", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

As per the University of Warwick research, the atmosphere of the planet, Kepler-438b, is thought to have been stripped away as a result of radiation emitted from a superflaring Red Dwarf star, Kepler-438. Regularly occurring every few hundred days, the superflares are approximately ten times more powerful than those ever recorded on the Sun and equivalent to the same energy as 100 billion megatons of TNT. While superflares themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on Kepler-438b's atmosphere, a dangerous phenomenon associated with powerful flares, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has the potential to strip away any atmosphere and render it uninhabitable. The planet Kepler-438b, to date the exoplanet with the highest recorded Earth Similarity Index, is both similar in size and temperature to the Earth but is in closer proximity to the Red Dwarf than the Earth is to the Sun. Lead researcher David Armstrong explained that if the planet, Kepler-438b, has a magnetic field like the Earth, it may be shielded from some of the effects, but if it does not, or the flares are strong enough, it could have lost its atmosphere, be irradiated by extra dangerous radiation and be a much harsher place for life to exist.

McConnell, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler all stood on the Senate floor in February and acquitted Trump on charges he abused his power in office and obstructed Congress. But now that it's time for Trump to return the favor, our self-absorbed President seems to be doing everything he can to make it harder for all three -- and perhaps giving the Democrats the gift of control of the Senate as he leaves office. Trump's political messages started hurting the Republican senators in Georgia long before this Christmas season. Trump railed against early voting throughout the campaign to sow doubt about the election results and set the predicate for the outrageous claims of voter fraud and attempts to nullify the November election. Early voting, traditionally a strong suit for Republicans, provided Biden with the margins he needed around the country. In Georgia, Perdue fell just short of the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff in his re-election bid. In the other Georgia Senate contest, Loeffler came in second to Democrat Raphael Warnock in a race where no candidate hit the threshold. The combination of massive early voting by Democrats and lower numbers on the GOP side made the January 5 runoffs possible. Trump's reaction to the election results has also hit Perdue and Loeffler hard. His bitter criticism of Georgia's Republican governor and secretary of state for not helping him overturn the results has split the Republican Party in the state. Setting off a circular firing squad within the Republican Party was an unexpected gift for the Democrats.", "image_url": "<img class=\"media__image\" src=\"//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/201223215641-tom-reed-screengrab-for-vpx-exlarge-169.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104019", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Until the 20th Amendment was ratified in 1933, this gap lasted from early November until March 4, when Presidents were inaugurated. This four-month gap allowed Congress to count and report votes and gave the President-elect sufficient time to travel to the capital. But the problems that could arise during this time -- along with technological advances that cut down on travel time -- created pressure to shorten the window, especially after the infamous \"Secession Winter\" of 1860 left President-elect Abraham Lincoln powerless as several Southern states left the union to form the Confederacy. The   moved Inauguration Day to January 20 (and set the start date for a new Congress on January 3). If the nation needed one last reminder of why the shift was necessary, they got it after the 1932 election, when President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt was unable to launch the New Deal   amidst the deteriorating economic crisis of the Great Depression.    It turns out, however, that even two months is no guarantee of a smooth interregnum. President Donald Trump has managed to use his remaining time in office to act as a political wrecking ball while the country is still being ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic.   Trump, who had been spouting false claims of voter fraud for months, launched several failed lawsuits in an attempt to challenge the election results in key swing states, and also contacted  to try to persuade them to intervene on his behalf. Even when this strategy proved unfruitful, and his attempt to hold onto power looked increasingly desperate, the President continued to maintain with no credible evidence that the election had been rigged.

There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.

Here's why ", "author": null, "author_link": "http://www.catchnews.com/author/speed-news-desk-1436187530.html", "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Size doesn't matter here! Elephants tend to have smaller sperm than mice because the larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length, a new study suggests. In the animal world, if several males mate with the same female, their sperm compete to fertilise her limited supply of eggs. Longer sperm often seem to have a competitive advantage.  However, the study conducted by researchers from the Universities of Zurich and Stockholm now shows that the size of the animals also matters. The larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length. That is why elephants have smaller sperm than mice, researchers said. Stefan Lupold from the University of Zurich and his colleague John Fitzpatrick from University of Stockholm compared the influence of sperm competition on the evolution of sperm in 100 mammalian species.  Unlike previous studies, however, they did not just consider sperm length, but also the number of sperm per ejaculate, which is important as the resources available for sperm production need to be shared between sperm size and number. In other words, the longer every individual sperm, the fewer of them a testicle of a certain size can produce. Earlier studies suggested that the number of sperm might be just as important as sperm length, if not even more so.  After all, the more sperm a male fields against his competitors, the greater the likelihood that one of them will win. Based on their joint consideration of sperm size and number, and with the aid of new meta-analytical methods, the researchers now show that species facing intense sperm competition invest more in their ejaculates on average than their monogamous counterparts. Moreover, they discovered that whether the length or the number of sperm is more important actually depends on the size of the animals.  The bigger the animal, the greater the selection pressure on the overall investments in ejaculates and the more important the number of sperm becomes compared to sperm length. This is due to the more voluminous female reproductive tract, in which the sperm tend to get lost or become \"diluted.\"  In larger species, sperm length or speed probably comes into effect only if a sufficient number of sperm manage to get near the egg, researchers said. In smaller species, however, the distance for sperm to cover is shorter and the risk of loss much smaller, allowing the advantage of longer sperm to manifest itself. As a result, you tend to find the most complex sperm forms in small species, not in large ones. For instance, small fruit flies have the longest sperm ever described, not whales, whose sperm are less than a tenth of a millimetre long and almost a thousand times shorter than those of the flies.

This is the question that many people are asking… while several sectors including automobile, real estate, financial services - non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in particular, and manufacturing have shown signs of impact from this economic slowdown. The start-up ecosystem seems to be holding up the jury is still out on this as these are still early days. In the last few years several start-ups have raised millions. While the valuations game is still not fully understood,and funding continues to be a double-edged sword. While funding is crucial for all types of companies, a well-funded company can create immense value and disrupt markets, mismanagement of funds or over funding can be a recipe for disaster. The Indian start-up environment is highly unforgiving. Failures are not celebrated but looked down on so a failed enterprise entrepreneur will find it difficult to regain investor confidence. Entrepreneurs sometimes lack the understanding as to if he needs to expose himself to fresh funding and what needs to be done. There is a need for start-ups to get access to a good mentor or advisor. Operating in this very environment is what Radar India Advisors does. Radar India Advisors was founded with the objective to be an advisor to these start-ups and also help them with access to funds. Set up in 2017, Radar India Advisors is an entrepreneur led outfit built to empower and engage entrepreneurs in their various stages of growth. The management of Radar has built and exited 3 different businesses themselves which helps the sensitise first time and even veteran entrepreneurs. In the last 2 years, the investments in start-ups advised by Radar has grown 10 times. Some of the start-ups managed by Radar include Smartivity, Avishkar Box, Coffee bond, Clevergene Biocorp and Pikapika. In the case of Smartivity and Avishkar Box, has worked closely right from the seed stage funding. Radar facilitated an early stage investment of Rs 60 lakhs from S Chand group into Smartivity. Today, Smartivity has raised a total of 22 crores is currently valued at 100 cr that’s a jump in valuation from 2 cr to 100 cr in 4 years. The revenues of Smartivity stand at Rs 20 cr. Similarly, Radar India Advisors was instrumental in facilitating a Pre-Series A funding of Rs 5 crore into Avishkar Box from Auxano Trust, their revenues stand at 18crore a jump of 800% from the initial 2cr. They are currently valued at 100cr. In the case of Coffee Bond, Radar facilitated a “Pre Series A” funding of Rs 1.5 crore from Auxano Trust in January 2019- revenue jump from Rs 80 Lakhs annually to Rs 3.23 crores in one year and their footprint has grown from one cafe outlet to 13 outlets of sale.  Clevergene Biocorp another company advised by Radar is in the process of closing a Pre-Series A funding from Auxano Trust and has seen a revenue jump from 2 crore to 6 crore(expected for FY 2019-20). PikaPika a kids app to censor content on phone for kids is another client for whom Radar has raised Rs 1 crore from Auxano trust in October and they have seen a big spike in users.  Speaking on the success that Radar has had so far Rahul Gupta CEO, Radar India Advisors Said, “It is important that when working with any start-up, it is critical that we understand what to look for I believe there are six main points that we need to look at, number one is to look for the right fight entrepreneur in diverse industries. People who understand their business and the environment they operate in. Number two is to build a personal touch with the entrepreneurs. Number three is to put your money where your mouth is or to invest into the client yourself. Number four is to look for businesses who are solution providers and not valuation hunters. And finally, we try and give PE level advisory to startups. In terms of investors we work with a host of family offices as well as big business houses like S Chand and Auxano trust, here the key is to Giving investors a sector agnostic approach and a wide range of businesses to invest in.” Radar India Advisors has been steadily adding to its portfolio and is currently advising the Made Easy group on strategy and investment in start-ups. Made Easy has revenues of over  Rs 400 cr.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104022", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Lam was able to deliver the annual address more than an hour later by video, but the hostile reception inside the Legislative Council marked a slap in the face for the embattled chief executive grappling with anti-government protests now in their fifth month. When Lam started delivering the speech, she was shouted down by chanting pro-democracy lawmakers who held aloft placards showing her waving with hands colored blood-red. They also used a projector to light up Lam’s face and the wall behind her with protesters’ key demands. Lam left the chamber and then came back about 20 minutes later to try again, only to be met with further fury. One legislator brandishing a placard climbed onto a desk. Again, the council president stopped the session and Lam left. One lawmaker wearing a paper mask showing the face of Chinese President Xi Jinping tossed a placard as Lam walked out. Finally, 75 minutes after the previously scheduled start of the lengthy address, Lam delivered it via video link, with China’s yellow-starred red flag to her right and Hong Kong’s flag on her left. Describing the semi-autonomous Chinese territory as going through “major crisis,” Lam said: “People are asking: Will Hong Kong return to normal?” She appealed for its 7.5 million citizens to “cherish the city,” warning that “continued violence and spread of hatred will erode the core values of Hong Kong.” Standing ramrod-straight, she then launched into a dry and detailed explanation of plans to tackle Hong Kong’s shortage of affordable housing, a long-standing source of discontent, and other welfare issues. With its focus on such minutiae as building new tunnels and freeing up land for development, the 50-minute speech titled “Treasure Hong Kong our home” only fueled criticism that Lam is deaf to protesters’ concerns about the future of the territory’s freedoms, unique in China. In a subsequent news conference, Lam again made clear that she wouldn’t resign and insisted there has been no erosion “whatsoever” of Hong Kong’s freedoms. “Hong Kong is still a very free society,” she said. Even before Lam delivered her speech, one of the protesting lawmakers, Claudia Mo, dismissed it as a “shame and a sham” and said the chief executive had lost all authority. “She is just a puppet on strings, being played by Beijing,” Mo said at an impromptu news conference with other lawmakers outside the chamber after they successfully thwarted Lam’s address there. They played a recording on a small loudspeaker they said was the sound of police tear-gassing protesters and of protesters’ wails. “These are the voices of people screaming and they are just ordinary Hong Kong people,” said lawmaker Tanya Chan. “Please, please, please Mrs. Carrie Lam, don’t let us suffer any more.” She and others called for Lam’s resignation. “This is the only way that we can have a good future,” said Chan. Pro-Beijing legislators condemned the disruption, among them Martin Liao, who called it “totally unforgivable.” Lam had been bracing for trouble in the chamber as her government battles the protests that started in June over a contested extradition bill and have snowballed into a sustained anti-government, anti-police and anti-China movement. The widespread use of tear gas by riot-control squads and 2,600 arrests, widely decried as heavy handed, have triggered public disgust with the 30,000-strong police force once considered among Asia’s finest. Hardcore black-clad and masked protesters have responded with widespread vandalism of China-linked businesses, subway stations and other targets, and attacked police with gasoline bombs and other weapons. This month, two police shootings that injured teenage protesters, the stabbing of a police officer, and the detonation of a small, remote-controlled bomb close to police officers ratcheted up violence to levels unprecedented since the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. Saying rioters are “spreading chaos and fear,” Lam appealed for order and sought to end her address on a positive note.

Trump’s refusal to sign the bipartisan package as he demands larger COVID relief checks and complains about “pork” spending could also force a federal government shutdown when money runs out at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday in the middle of a pandemic. “It’s a chess game and we are pawns,” said Lanetris Haines, a self-employed single mother of three in South Bend, Indiana, who stands to lose her $129 weekly jobless benefit unless Trump signs the package into law or succeeds in his improbable quest for changes. Washington has been reeling since Trump threw the package into limbo after it had already won sweeping approval in both houses of Congress and after the White House assured Republican leaders that Trump would support it. Instead, he has assailed the bill’s plan to provide $600 COVID relief checks to most Americans — insisting it should be $2,000. House Republicans swiftly rejected that idea during a rare Christmas Eve session. But Trump has not been swayed. “I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill,” Trump tweeted Saturday from Palm Beach, Florida, where he is spending the holiday. “Also, stop the billions of dollars in ‘pork.’” President-elect Joe Biden called on Trump to sign the bill immediately as two federal programs providing unemployment aid were set to expire Saturday. “It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don’t know if they’ll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump’s refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,” Biden said in a statement. He accused Trump of an “abdication of responsibility” that has “devastating consequences.” “I’ve been talking to people who are scared they’re going to be kicked out from their homes, during the Christmas holidays, and still might be if we don’t sign this bill,” said Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat. Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, has calculated that 11 million people would lose aid from the programs immediately without additional relief; millions more would exhaust other unemployment benefits within weeks. Andrew Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert and senior fellow at the Century Foundation think tank, said the number may be closer to 14 million because joblessness has spiked since Thanksgiving. “All these folks and their families will suffer if Trump doesn’t sign the damn bill,” Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, tweeted Wednesday. How and when people are affected by the lapse depends on the state they live in, the program they are relying on and when they applied for benefits. In some states, people on regular unemployment insurance could continue to receive payments under a program that extends benefits when the jobless rate surpasses a certain threshold, Stettner said. About 9.5 million people, however, rely on the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that expires altogether Saturday. That program made unemployment insurance available to freelancers, gig workers and others who are normally not eligible. After receiving their last checks, those recipients will not be able to file for more aid after Saturday, Stettner said. While payments could be received retroactively, any gap means more hardship and uncertainty for Americans who have already grappled with bureaucratic delays, often depleting much of their savings to stay afloat while waiting for payments to kick in. They are people like Earl McCarthy, a father of four who lives in South Fulton, Georgia, and has been relying on unemployment since losing his job as a sales representative for a luxury senior living community. He said he will be left with no income by the second week of January if Trump fails to sign the bill. McCarthy said he already burned through much of his savings as he waited five months to begin receiving his unemployment benefits. After leaving weekly messages with the unemployment agency, McCarthy reached out to the South Fulton mayor’s office, then to his state legislative representative to ask for help. He finally started getting payments in November. “The entire experience was horrifying,” said McCarthy, who is receiving about $350 a week in unemployment insurance. “For me, I shudder to think if I had not saved anything or had an emergency fund through those five months, where would we have been?” he said. “It’s going to be difficult if the president doesn’t sign this bill.” The bill awaiting Trump’s signature would also activate a weekly $300 federal supplement to unemployment payments. Sharon Shelton Corpening had been hoping the extra help would allow her 83-year-old mother, with whom she lives, to stop eating into her social security payments to make their $1,138 rent. Corpening, who lives in the Atlanta area, had launched a freelance content strategy business that was just taking off before the pandemic hit, prompting several of her contracts to fall through. She is receiving about $125 a week under the pandemic unemployment program and says she will be unable to pay her bills in about a month. This, despite her temporary work for the U.S. census and as an elections poll worker. “We on the brink,” said Corpening, who lobbies for Unemployment Action, a project launched by the Center for Popular Democracy to fight for relief. “One more month, if that. Then, I run out of everything.” Trump, meanwhile, has been spending his final days in office golfing and angrily tweeting as he refuses to accept his loss to Biden in the Nov. 3 election. On Saturday, he again lashed out at members of his own party for failing to join his quest to try to overturn the results of the election with baseless claims of mass voter fraud that have been repeatedly rejected by the courts. “If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen before, the Democrat Senators would consider it an act of war, and fight to the death,” he railed. He said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Republicans “just want to let it pass. NO FIGHT!” Trump also lashed out at the Supreme Court, the Justice Department and the FBI as he seemed to encourage his supporters to gather in Washington on Jan. 6, the day Congress tallies the Electoral College vote — even though a similar event last month  , with multiple people being stabbed in the capital’s streets. In addition to freezing unemployment benefits, Trump’s lack of action on the bill would lead to the expiration of eviction protections and put on hold a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters, along with money to help schools and vaccine distribution. The relief is also attached to a $1.4 trillion government funding bill to keep the federal government operating.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104022", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "telanganatoday.com", "section": "Sport", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://telanganatoday.com/lakers-rout-mavs-while-nets-bucks-win", "title": "Lakers rout Mavs while Nets, Bucks win", "author": " ", "author_link": null, "published_date": "26th Dec 2020", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "\n", "text": ": Anthony Davis scored 28 points while LeBron James added 22 as the defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers routed Dallas 138-115 in Friday’s feature game of a record-setting Christmas slate.

James, who turns 36 on Wednesday, rose to second on the NBA’s all-time Christmas points list with 383, passing Oscar Robertson by six to pull within 12 of matching the late Kobe Bryant’s career record. It was the 10th Christmas victory in 15 holiday appearances by James, who equaled former Miami teammate Dwyane Wade for the most career Christmas NBA wins.

Robinson finished with 23 points, hitting 7-of-13 from beyond the arc, in leading 2020 NBA runner-up Miami over visiting New Orleans 111-98. Also rolling to a holiday triumph were the Milwaukee Bucks, who had a game-high 31 points from Khris Middleton to beat Golden State 138-99 — the second-most lopsided blowout in NBA Christmas history — thanks to a 72-43 Bucks edge in the second half. At Boston, Brooklyn’s Kevin Durant scored 16 of his 29 in the third quarter and the Nets seized an 86-77 edge before pulling away in the fourth quarter. \nGoran Dragic came off Miami’s bench to score 18 points, and Bam Adebayo added 17 for the Heat, whose NBA-best Christmas record is 11-2 despite Jimmy Butler missing the second half with right ankle stiffness. At Milwaukee, two-time reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 15 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to spark the Bucks, while two-time MVP Stephen Curry had a team-best 19 points. The Los Angeles Clippers beat host Denver 121-108 despite an injury to Kawhi Leonard midway into the fourth quarter when teammate Serge Ibaka struck him in the face going for a rebound, leaving him bleeding and sprawled on the court.

New captain Ajinkya Rahane had a great day in office as he marshalled his resources impressively with debutant Mohammed Siraj (2/40 in 15 overs) repaying the faith shown in him with wickets of Marnus Labuschagne (48) and Cameron Green (12) with the old ball. However, the Test series is increasingly looking like Ashwin’s (3/35 in 24 overs) paradise as he once again made opposition’s best batsman Steve Smith (0) look ordinary, exploiting the turn and bounce that the first day of the MCG track offered. Bumrah (4/56 in 16 overs) was bowling as if it was business as usual, beating the bat and getting those breakthroughs just when it mattered on a pitch that had retained moisture. As it turned out, Rahane didn’t lose a bad toss. The Indian team looked way more galvanised despite being without regular skipper Vurat Kohli, who is on paternity leave. Some great catches were taken and the intent was way more visible. \nRahane’s first punt was introducing Ashwin inside the first hour of play after Bumrah had forced Joe Burns (0) to nick one to Rishabh Pant. Ashwin, who varied the pace of his deliveries cleverly got some turn and bounce straightaway as he drew Matthew Wade into coming down the track and skying one for India’s best fielder Ravindra Jadeja to take a well-judged catch running backwards. After one that jumped and turned beating Smith and Pant, Ashwin kept the next a tad straighter and the former Australian skipper’s glance was pouched by Cheteshwar Pujara at leg gully. \nAll this while, Bumrah was beating the bat at the other hand. Interestingly, Rahane didn’t give the debutant a single over before lunch break as he knew that Siraj’s strength is generating pace and movement with semi-new and old ball. Siraj, initially bowled a bit short at Labuschagne and Travis Head (38 off 92 balls) as they added 86 runs for the fourth wicket. It was Bumrah, who provided the post lunch breakthrough with a delivery that held its line and the left-hander’s thick edge was taken by Rahane at gully. Siraj’s maiden wicket was a lucky one as the ball was drifting down the leg-side which Labuschagne tried to whip but Shubman Gill, stationed at backward square leg, snapped it inches off the ground. However, the Hyderabad pacer’s second wicket was a much fuller ball with a hint of inward movement that caught Green plumb in-front. Skipper Tim Paine (13) couldn’t script a rescue act like Adelaide as a classical off-break saw him guide one straight into the hands of Hanuma Vihari at backward square leg. \nBumrah didn’t take much time after that as he and Ravindra Jadeja (1/15) polished off the tail in a jiffy.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bumrah-1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104022", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

To keep a pace bowler to twiddle his thumbs till after the luncheon interval is to test his mental fibre. But for Hyderabad’s Mohammad Siraj it was a blessing in disguise. The anticipation had only enhanced his focus and determination to perform at his best. His true character — his patience, his perseverance, his innate skills — came to the fore. This was indeed a dream Test debut for the Hyderabadi. The 26-year-old speedster was on a roll as a bowler and then held his nerves to bring off two catches in the deep to make a memorable debut against Australia on the Boxing Day of the second Test that got underway at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday. He finished with figures of 15-4-40-2. Stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane made the 26-year-old Siraj wait till 28th over, before he was given the ball. But Siraj scalped his first Test wicket with his 43rd ball in his second spell. With his third ball of his eighth over, he had the dangerous Marnus Labuschagne caught at leg slip by another Indian debutant of the match Shubman Gill. Labuschagne, who was hit on the helmet by a vicious Siraj bouncer earlier, tried to play the ball on leg side but it went to Gill, who caught it nicely. Siraj captured his second Test wicket when he trapped the tall Cameron Green leg before to get another big breakthrough for India. This time the fiery Siraj brought the ball in sharply to catch Green on the crease to get a favourable verdict from Australian umpire Paul Reiffel. The batsman referred the decision to DRS and the ball tracker showed the ball hitting the leg stump. A happy Siraj was surrounded by his teammates The Australian commentators were all praise for Siraj’s excellent bowling. Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath said Siraj was exceptional. Siraj further came into action when he held his first catch at fine leg, this time left-hander Michael Starc hooked Jasprit Bumrah straight into the fielder’s hands. The Hyderabad yet again held his nerve to clasp a skier at long on to dismiss the last man Pat Cummins off left-arm spinner Ravinder Jadeja. Surely Siraj’s father, late Mohammed Ghouse, who died last month, would be a happy man and would have blessed his son from heaven. Earlier, it was a huge moment when seasoned off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin handed over the Indian Test cap to him. “Coming over from first class and India A grind, you have earned this Test cap. Value it,’’ said Ashwin to Siraj in the morning’s ceremony. Siraj, a son of an autorickshaw driver, is the second Hyderabad fast bowler after Syed Abid Ali to play in Test cricket. Abid Ali claimed 6 for 55 in his debut Test in Adelaide in 1966. Former Test left-arm spinner SL Venkatapathy Raju said it is always a great feeling when a player gets a Test cap and a great relief and joy when a player takes his first Test wicket. “I made my debut in New Zealand in Christchurch in 1990 and as a spinner I had to wait to get my first over. You feel butterflies in your stomach anxious to get the first over. It was strange that skipper Ajinkya Rahane made Siraj, that too a fast bowler in Australia, to bowl his first over after lunch only. “But nevertheless Siraj bowled with a lot of fire. He has come through the first class and India A tour grinds. He looks like a solid prospect, said Raju. The 26-year-old fast bowler thus became the 298th player to get the Indian cap. There were two debutants in this match with opener Shubnam Gill becoming the 297th player. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

Instead, Democrats fault the tech platforms for failing to adequately moderate content to stop the spread of  , harmful content, extremism and voter manipulation. Both critiques miss the heart of the matter.  First, the platforms' business models — originally designed to   and   — are the very reason that disinformation goes viral in the first place. Second, whether the tech platforms are making fair, unbiased moderation decisions about what content reaches millions of people is the wrong question to ask. Instead, Congress and the American people should ask why we are allowing Big Tech that power in the first place. We must drastically deconcentrate control over speech so that any single company's bias or business model cannot have a sizable impact on public discourse.  Too much control over the marketplace of ideas is antithetical to democracy. That's why America has long had rules that limit such power, like media ownership limits that prohibit the same corporation from owning a TV station and newspaper in the same place. (Trump's  , incidentally, is currently trying to roll back those rules.) The government failed to limit consolidation and allowed Facebook and Google to morph into monopoly monsters. Big Tech didn't simply grow by being the best; the   recent 450-page report details just how extensive their anticompetitive behavior has been.

Orion's thermal protection system is one of the most critical parts of the spacecraft intended to facilitate human exploration of asteroids and of Mars. It consists of the spacecraft's main heat shield that faces into the atmosphere on reentry to slow the spaceship down and also the grid of tiles known as the back shell. During Orion's next mission atop the agency's Space Launch System rocket, called Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the spacecraft will be in space for more than three weeks and return to Earth under even faster and hotter conditions than during its last flight. \"As we move towards building the system for EM-1, we've been able to take advantage of what we learned from building and flying Orion to refine our processes going forward,\" said John Kowal, NASA's thermal protection system lead for Orion. During EM-1, Orion will endure a more intense re-entry environment. While the spacecraft encountered speeds of 30,000 feet per second during Exploration Flight Test-1 and temperatures of approximately 2,204 degrees Celsius, it will experience a faster return from lunar velocity of about 36,000 feet per second. The speed difference may seem subtle, but the heating the vehicle sees increases exponentially as the speed increases. Engineering teams are preparing Orion's heat shield to perform re-entry during any of missions planned near the Moon or in high lunar orbit in the coming years. For these future Orion missions, a silver, metallic-based thermal control coating will be bonded to the crew module's thermal protection system back shell tiles. The coating, similar to what is used on the main heat shield, will reduce heat loss during phases when Orion is pointed to space and therefore experiencing cold temperatures, as well as limit the high temperatures the crew module will be subjected to when the spacecraft faces the Sun. The coating will help Orion's back shell maintain a temperature range from approximately minus 101 to 287 degrees Celsius prior to entry and also will protect against electrical surface charges in space and during re-entry. Engineers have also refined the design in ways that improve the manufacturing process and reduce the mass of the spacecraft for the upcoming exploration missions. Instead of a monolithic outer layer, the heat shield will be made of about 180 blocks that can be made simultaneously with the other heat shield components to streamline the labour-and-time-intensive manufacturing process. In addition, engineers have found ways to reduce the mass of the heat shield's underlying structure, which is composed of a titanium skeleton and carbon fiber skin. Teams have optimised the thickness of the skeleton and the skin based on the pressures that different areas will experience during flight and reentry, adding more fidelity to the overall structure while allowing it to be lighter.

Hashim, who died in an attack on the Shangri-La hotel on April 21, inspired wealthy brothers Ilham Ibrahim and Inshaf Ibrahim to join and bankroll his assault, police and fellow Muslims said. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"We suspect the two brothers used their money from the spice business to finance the bombings,\" one police investigator said. \"It seems the indoctrination was via the internet -- Facebook and YouTube.\" \n\n           Neighbors of the Ibrahim brothers said they were secretive but devout Muslims. They were not active members of a congregation, community leaders said. \"We believe Zahran radicalized these people using Facebook,\" said R. Abdul Razik, a leader of the moderate Ceylon Thowheed Jama'ath (CTJ) group. \"Especially in the past year, he has been openly calling for the killing of non-Muslims.\" Investigators and community leaders believe the group also used social media private messaging apps to keep in touch without being noticed by the authorities. \n     The CTJ and the main body of Islamic clerics, the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, had alerted Sri Lanka's security establishment to Hashim and his acolytes, but said their warnings failed to get serious attention. The Sri Lankan government has already acknowledged that foreign intelligence warnings about the attacks were not passed on to ministers. \"We asked the intelligence agencies to take down the Facebook page of Zahran because he was polluting the minds of Sri Lankan Muslims,\" Razik said. \"We were told it is better to allow him to have the page so that the authorities could keep an eye on what he was doing.\" \n\n           Another moderate Islamic group, the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jama'ath (SLTJ) said it called a press conference in 2017 to warn authorities about Hashim, but no action was taken. \"Zahran indoctrinated people using social media. He was spewing an IS (ISIS) brand of propaganda that somehow appealed to the bombers,\" SLTJ spokesman Thawseef Ahamed told AFP. A fuller reckoning of those involved in the attacks was only released by authorities this week, revealing at least two sets of brothers. Ilham Ibrahim died at the Shangri-La hotel while his brother Inshaf Ibrahim bombed the Cinnamon Grand. \n     Ringleader Hashim also died at the Shangri-la, while his yet-to-be named brother blew himself up when surrounded on April 26 near the eastern coastal town of Kalmunai. He was with three widows of the Easter bombers when police and troops laid siege to the house. Sixteen people were killed there, including six children, relatives of Hashim, and members of his National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ) movement, which has since been banned. The pregnant wife of Ilham Ibrahim, Fathima Ilham, blew herself up when police raided the family home in Colombo hours after the bombings. She also killed her two children and three police officers. Mohamed Azzam Mubarak Mohamed has been named as the bomber who targeted the Kingsbury hotel in Colombo. His wife is now in police custody. A fourth hotel was on the bombers' list. The would-be attacker, Abdul Latheef, failed to set off his explosives. He detonated it a few hours later at a small motel, killing himself and two other people. Latheef studied aeronautical engineering at Kingston University in Britain and did post-graduate studies in Melbourne, Australia. Australian media said he was under investigation in 2014 by the country's counter-terrorism unit and may have travelled to Syria. He also came into contact with Hashim through Facebook posts and YouTube videos. \n     The men who bombed the three churches have been named as Ahmed Muaz, Mohamed Hasthun and Mohamed Nasser Mohamed Asad. The three were hardly known within their communities, according to Muslim leaders.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/03/090d88d4-581d-442b-a4bf-777969d980a6/thumbnail/620x413/237c2a4012b04c1aeb8d5758a521f17c/sri-lanka-bombings-1140776997.jpg#\" alt=\"Eastern Sri Lanka On The Edge After Easter Bombings \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/03/090d88d4-581d-442b-a4bf-777969d980a6/thumbnail/620x413/237c2a4012b04c1aeb8d5758a521f17c/sri-lanka-bombings-1140776997.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/03/090d88d4-581d-442b-a4bf-777969d980a6/thumbnail/1240x826/94d462ff64eb6f84c87f8600d3d932f5/sri-lanka-bombings-1140776997.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104022", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said the current slowdown in exports is mainly due to a decline in petroleum products, which constitute 13.42 per cent of overall outward shipments. This decline, he said, is mainly on account of fall in petroleum prices which has driven the export value downwards. However, \"the positive growth in the exports of non-conventional commodity groups like electronic goods, drugs, and pharmaceuticals, organic and inorganic chemicals, augurs well for future growth,\" he told PTI. India's export growth is in the negative zone since August 2019 due to a steep fall in shipments of key sectors like petroleum, engineering and gems and jewellery. Labour-intensive sectors such as carpets, ready-made garments, handloom and leather too are recording decline in export growth. As per the World Trade Organization (WTO), global merchandise trade volumes are expected to rise by only 1.2 per cent in 2019, substantially slower than the 2.6 per cent growth forecast in April 2019. However in 2020, the growth in trade volume is projected to accelerate to 2.7 per cent. Apex exporters body Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said the global situation is becoming extremely challenging as rising protectionism is leading to uncertainty. FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai said the global situation is likely to improve in the first half of 2020, which would have a positive impact on India's exports. \"If the global situation improves, which is likely in the first half of 2020, we may look for 15 per cent growth in exports in the next financial year (2020-21). Exports will come out of negative zone next year but the rate of growth will not be in double digits,\" he said. He added that the order book position of Indian exporters is encouraging and less volatility in the domestic currency has also been a positive factor for traders. Sahai also said that Indian exports have to be aligned with changing import patterns of the global economy as 50 per cent of the world imports today is accounted by electrical and electronics products, automobiles, machinery, petroleum products and plastic items. \"While employment-intensive sectors should be pushed in exports, the new strategy should focus on technology-driven sectors,\" he said. Sharing similar views, Professor Rakesh Mohan Joshi from the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) said the steps taken by the government would help exports record growth in 2020. \"There is a need to take structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of Indian products in the global markets,\" Joshi said. The commerce ministry is considering several steps such as the announcement of the new WTO-compliant export incentive scheme and the new foreign trade policy for the next five years in 2020 to push the country's exports. The ministry has conducted a series of meetings with concerned stakeholders to finalise the foreign trade policy. On the trade front, India has been negotiating the mega free trade agreement RCEP  (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) since 2013. But in November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will not join the RCEP deal as negotiations failed to satisfactorily address New Delhi's \"outstanding issues and concerns\". Since January this year, exports have recorded a low rate of growth and slipped into the negative zone in August. During April-November 2019-20, the country's exports contracted by 2 per cent to USD 212 billion. Going by the current trend, FIEO has estimated that the exports may stand at USD 330-340 billion in the current fiscal. In 2018-19, the exports grew by 9 per cent to USD 331 billion from USD 303.5 billion in 2017-18. Since 2011-12, India's exports have been hovering at around USD 300 billion.

He told them a raft carrying nine people had overturned and his baby son and nephew had been swept away along the other child and man. The agents heard the man's wife and an older son screaming in the darkness and the two were pulled from the muddy water alive, according to a preliminary report of the incident from the official. \n  \n  \n\n \n Another man and his 13-year-old child were rescued nearby, the official said. The children were hospitalized for observation. Border agents searching for the missing found the infant, a second official said. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. A record number of Central American families are crossing the border, some on foot and some via the river. Just last week, border agents rescued 10 people in a sinking raft in the same area, including a 3-year-old child who had become separated from her mother on the Mexico side. \n\n           During the last budget year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection rescue teams responded to more than 4,300 emergencies. There were 283 deaths, including those who drowned or died in the deserts. The high was in 2005's fiscal year, when 492 people died. \n     The number of   last month was a 12-year high; more than 103,000 people were encountered, including more than 53,000 people traveling as part of families.

Her skeletal remains provided scientists with invaluable information regarding the human race and its evolution, and Google is celebrating this day with a Doodle. Lucy Australopithecus has been proven to have lived around 3.2 million years ago in Ehtiopia. The Google Doodle dedicated to her today shows three stages of Lucy's evolution. Currently, Lucy's bones are kept in a museum in Ethiopia. Here's more about our ancestor Lucy: 1) 'Lucy' was the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton ever found. Australopithecus afarensis is a species that shares both human and ape characteristics that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. Around 40 per cent of Lucy's remains were discovered intact. 2) Do you know who named her Lucy? Paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson named the fossils Lucy after the Beatles song ' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.' 3) Lucy is a crucial stepping stone between apes and Homo Sapiens. It was exactly 41 years ago from today when the oldest known example of a bipedal primate came into the knowledge of humans. 4) Lucy had numerous similarities with chimpanzees.The skeleton revealed that she mostly walked upright. Bipedalism, walking using two rear limbs or legs, is a key distinction between Homo Sapiens and chimpanzees. 5) According to  , with a mixture of ape and human features - including long dangling arms with pelvic, spine, foot, and leg bones suited to walking upright - slender Lucy stood three-and-a-half feet tall. 6) Lucy is determined as a female due to her size. Fossils that were discovered later were larger in size and were identified as males. 7) Lucy was fully grown, for her wisdom teeth were very human-like. They were exposed and had been in use for a while before her death.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://images.catchnews.com/uploads/images/2015/11/24/lucy-skeleton.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy_Skeleton.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104023", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Ghouse had passed away on November 19. “It was one of the biggest losses for our family. Siraj was inconsolable when he heard that `Abba jaan’ had died. We had great difficulty in controlling his emotions from here to Australia. He was very low in confidence and contemplated at one point even coming back to India. Luckily the Indian team members, particularly Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri, played a big role in consoling him,’’ added Ismail.

There was always a big smile on his face and sense of satisfaction whenever Siraj donned the Indian colours.’’ From the quaint lanes of Khaja Nagar in Banjara Hills, 26-year-old Siraj has fulfilled his father’s dreams. “We came through a lot of hardships. Being an autorickshaw driver, my father and mother Shabana Begum did all sundry works. I was studious while Siraj was always busy playing cricket in the small lanes. My mother was often upset because Siraj never focused his attention on studies. She would often beat him saying that he is wasting his career by playing the game. “But my father always supported Siraj. He would quietly slip in money in Siraj’s pocket and encouraged him to play cricket. Siraj was very passionate about the game and fast bowling. Today, we are all happy that he is going to play for India in Test cricket, that too at the magnificent MCG ground. He would be having my father’s blessings from heaven. It is a big moment for our family,’’ said Ismail, who had passed his engineering in 2014 and now acts as a manager for his brother. Siraj had moved to Toli Chowki where he could give best comforts to his parents. “We have not sold our father’s auto. He proudly travelled in Jeep Compass in the last few years.’’ Former chairman of National selection Committee MSK Prasad said he always believed Siraj had the potential to play for India. “He is one of the successful cricketers in India A matches.

Former Hyderabad opener Abdul Azeem, who was instrumental in shaping Siraj’s career when he gave him cricket shoes etc, said God is great. “I have seen the hardships the family went through.

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route. A clarification on the non-applicability of the new FDI measure would be critical for them to continue making massive investments in India,\" it added.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104024", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The small Hableany (Mermaid) tour boat collided with the Viking Sigyn river cruise ship on May 29 near the Hungarian Parliament in Budapest. All but two of those killed were South Korean tourists aboard the Mermaid. Seven South Koreans on the boat survived but the remains of one missing female South Korean tourist have not been recovered. Col. Adrian Pal of the Budapest Police reported the results of the recently-concluded investigation, which contained 11,000 pages of documentation and over 4,200 photos. Authorities have not released the name of the deceased captain of the Mermaid. Pal also denied media reports that the Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn, identified only as Yuriy C., had been drinking or was not at his post when the collision took place on a rainy spring night shortly after 9 p.m. “No signs of alcohol or other mind-altering drugs were found” in samples taken from the captain immediately after the incident, Pal said. “(He) was on the bridge at the time of the accident. There are clear sound recordings of this.” Yuriy C. is the only suspect so far in the case and is under pre-trial arrest until Nov. 30 at the latest. He is suspected of endangering water transport resulting in a fatal mass catastrophe and of failing to offer aid at the time of the crash. Pal said the Viking Sigyn’s captain claimed several times in his testimony that that he “simply did not notice” the Mermaid before the collision after sunset near the base of the city’s famous Margit Bridge. Pal also said the river cruise ship’s technical equipment was in working order and that the radar which would have warned his crew about the Mermaid’s proximity was turned on, although its sound was off. It was not clear why the sound was off. “The explanation could be that traffic on the Danube is so heavy that (the radar’s alarm) would be beeping constantly,” said Pal, saying it could have been hard to filter out the truly unsafe condition from other false alarms. Police are also conducting a separate investigation into the possible responsibility of the captain and the crew of the Viking Idun, a sister ship of the Sigyn, which it was following not far behind when the collision occurred. Pal said police were trying to determine whether those on the Idun also failed to offer aid to victims of the collision. The Mermaid was raised out of the Danube by a huge floating crane on June 11.

As per the University of Warwick research, the atmosphere of the planet, Kepler-438b, is thought to have been stripped away as a result of radiation emitted from a superflaring Red Dwarf star, Kepler-438. Regularly occurring every few hundred days, the superflares are approximately ten times more powerful than those ever recorded on the Sun and equivalent to the same energy as 100 billion megatons of TNT. While superflares themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on Kepler-438b's atmosphere, a dangerous phenomenon associated with powerful flares, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has the potential to strip away any atmosphere and render it uninhabitable. The planet Kepler-438b, to date the exoplanet with the highest recorded Earth Similarity Index, is both similar in size and temperature to the Earth but is in closer proximity to the Red Dwarf than the Earth is to the Sun. Lead researcher David Armstrong explained that if the planet, Kepler-438b, has a magnetic field like the Earth, it may be shielded from some of the effects, but if it does not, or the flares are strong enough, it could have lost its atmosphere, be irradiated by extra dangerous radiation and be a much harsher place for life to exist.

This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL).

More than 100 trains were cancelled in in the two days before Thursday, according to a statement by Indian Railways. Three special trains were running from Puri to evacuate pilgrims and tourists. Authorities have asked tourists to leave coastal areas and avoid unnecessary travel. Special buses were deployed in Puri and other towns to get them out.

Tides could also surge up to five feet. India's weather office has warned that the high speed winds can uproot trees, flatten crops and damage homes, power and communication infrastructure. The neighboring coastal states of Andhra Pradesh, home to 50 million people, and Tamil Nadu, population some 70 million, have also been put on high alert.

He also said they were in good position in the first two days of the pink-ball Test. “We had two good days but had just one bad hour where we lost completely. The talk in the dressing room was about backing ourselves as an individual and as a team and stick to the plan whatever it is,” he added on the eve of the second Test. However, Kohli’s departure weakened the Indian batting a bit in trouble and Rahane conceded that they would miss their skipper. There were suggestions to promote himself to No.4 but the middle-order batsman said they have not decided anything yet. “Openers role is crucial but I don’t want to put pressure on them. Just want to give them freedom to play. We will definitely miss Virat. When you have a player like him, it is great for the team.” \nIndia looked in a good position with Kohli and Rahane batting well in the first innings before Kohli was run out. Speaking about the incident, he revealed the momentum shifted in hosts’ favour. “It was a tough one. We were going really well. I saw the momentum going in Australia’s way after the run out. After the end of play, I said sorry to him (Kohli) and he was ok with it. He understood the situation. Such things happen and you have to respect that and move forward.” He further informed that Kohli had a message for the team before heading to India. “He spoke to all of us before leaving. We had a team dinner in Adelaide. He spoke about playing to our strength. We have been playing well. We have to help each other and enjoy each other’s success.” The bowling department will be without Mohammad Shami, who was injured and ruled out of the remainder of the series but the 32-year-old said they are capable of delivering the goods. “Bumrah is a quality bowler and he has been doing really well. Apart from that, Umesh (Yadav) and a guy who will play (Mohammad Siraj), it is about bowling in partnerships. We have discussed how to go about it. It is about bowling in partnerships and bowling towards the plan.” When asked about Australia coach Justin Langer’s comments where he said Indians were under stress after the loss, Rahane added, “Australians are very good at playing mind games. Let them do that. We are focusing on ourselves on what we need to do. We will back ourselves and be positive,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

The departure of Kohli also leaves a big void in the batting order, making it more vulnerable. However, former Indian cricketer Ajit Agarkar feels Rahane should bat high in the batting order to bring stability to the unit. “I think Rahane should promote himself to number four in Kohli’s absence. He has the experience and he has scored runs away from India. This is the time when a leader needs to stand up, I will be surprised if Rahane does not promote himself to number four,” Agarkar said. “I think Shubman Gill should play, I have been advocating for that for a while, he has the potential. I know he opens for Punjab in domestic cricket, but if someone like him does well, he can serve Indian cricket for a long time,” Agarkar added. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

Here's why ", "author": null, "author_link": "http://www.catchnews.com/author/speed-news-desk-1436187530.html", "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Size doesn't matter here! Elephants tend to have smaller sperm than mice because the larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length, a new study suggests. In the animal world, if several males mate with the same female, their sperm compete to fertilise her limited supply of eggs. Longer sperm often seem to have a competitive advantage.  However, the study conducted by researchers from the Universities of Zurich and Stockholm now shows that the size of the animals also matters. The larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length. That is why elephants have smaller sperm than mice, researchers said. Stefan Lupold from the University of Zurich and his colleague John Fitzpatrick from University of Stockholm compared the influence of sperm competition on the evolution of sperm in 100 mammalian species.  Unlike previous studies, however, they did not just consider sperm length, but also the number of sperm per ejaculate, which is important as the resources available for sperm production need to be shared between sperm size and number. In other words, the longer every individual sperm, the fewer of them a testicle of a certain size can produce. Earlier studies suggested that the number of sperm might be just as important as sperm length, if not even more so.  After all, the more sperm a male fields against his competitors, the greater the likelihood that one of them will win. Based on their joint consideration of sperm size and number, and with the aid of new meta-analytical methods, the researchers now show that species facing intense sperm competition invest more in their ejaculates on average than their monogamous counterparts. Moreover, they discovered that whether the length or the number of sperm is more important actually depends on the size of the animals.  The bigger the animal, the greater the selection pressure on the overall investments in ejaculates and the more important the number of sperm becomes compared to sperm length. This is due to the more voluminous female reproductive tract, in which the sperm tend to get lost or become \"diluted.\"  In larger species, sperm length or speed probably comes into effect only if a sufficient number of sperm manage to get near the egg, researchers said. In smaller species, however, the distance for sperm to cover is shorter and the risk of loss much smaller, allowing the advantage of longer sperm to manifest itself. As a result, you tend to find the most complex sperm forms in small species, not in large ones. For instance, small fruit flies have the longest sperm ever described, not whales, whose sperm are less than a tenth of a millimetre long and almost a thousand times shorter than those of the flies.

An announcement Wednesday in the Royal Gazette said Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya was legally married to the 66-year-old king, and was now Queen Suthida. \n     Although she has been in the public eye for about three years, there has been little official information released about her and the news was a surprise to many Thais. She is reported to be 40 years old and to have previously worked as a flight attendant for Thai Airways International. The two reportedly met on a flight. Suthida joined the palace guard in 2013 and became commander of the king's security unit, currently holding a general's rank. The new queen also has several top royal decorations. \n  \n  \n\n \n Vajiralongkorn has had three previous marriages and divorced his previous wife, with whom he has a son, in 2014. He   after the death in October 2016 of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej. \n\n           Thai television, which broadcast the royal order Wednesday evening, showed a video of Suthida prostrating herself before the king. According to the announcer, she presented the king with a tray of flowers and joss sticks, and in return was bestowed traditional gifts associated with royal power. TV showed the king in a white uniform and his bride in a pink silk traditional dress formally registering their marriage on Wednesday in his palace residence in Bangkok. The couple was seen signing a marriage certificate book, which was also signed by the king's sister, Princess Sirindhorn, and Privy Council head Prem Tinsulanonda as witnesses. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and other senior officials were also in attendance. Thailand is ruled by a military government and the royal family still wields significant influence as an embodiment of power. \n     Insulting the monarch, queen or heir apparent is punishable by three to 15 years in prison under Thai law. In practice, however, the rules are more widely interpreted, and the military government has been criticized for its   to silence critics since it seized power in May 2014.  The \"lese majeste\" law has been widely condemned, including by rights groups and the United Nations, which has called for it to be revoked. Some 100 cases of lese majeste have been prosecuted since the 2014 coup, according to the legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. \n\n    \n          ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/ce55dc3a-f495-48e2-9fd5-70fa01f72fab/thumbnail/620x412/5f395c556933047e4a7ed8bcec5eb7d0/thailand-king-vajiralongkorn-queen.jpg#\" alt=\"King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his consort, General Suthida Vajiralongkorn named Queen Suthida attend their wedding ceremony in Bangkok \" height=\"412\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/ce55dc3a-f495-48e2-9fd5-70fa01f72fab/thumbnail/620x412/5f395c556933047e4a7ed8bcec5eb7d0/thailand-king-vajiralongkorn-queen.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/ce55dc3a-f495-48e2-9fd5-70fa01f72fab/thumbnail/1240x824/a34111188011846150d915260bd4e9ce/thailand-king-vajiralongkorn-queen.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20412'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104026", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Assange appeared by video link from prison for the hearing at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court. \n     According to a reporter for The Guardian newspaper who was in the courtroom, the judge asked Assange whether he would voluntarily surrender to the U.S. extradition request. \"I do not wish to surrender myself for extradition for doing journalism that has won many, many awards and protected many people,\" Assange replied. The judge adjourned the brief proceeding and said the next hearing, another procedural one, would be held on May 30, with a more substantial hearing set for June 12, according to the Reuters news agency. \n  \n  \n\n \n A few dozen supporters holding signs reading \"Free Assange\" and \"No extradition\" gathered outside the courthouse before the hearing. It's an early stage in what is likely to be a months- or years-long extradition process. The 47-year-old Australian was   in prison for separate charges on jumping bail in 2012 and holing up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. At the time, he was facing extradition to Sweden for questioning over rape and sexual assault allegations made by two women. Assange said he took to hiding in the embassy out of fear -- what he called \"terrifying circumstances\" -- of being sent to the U.S. to face charges related to  ' publication of classified U.S. military documents. WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said Wednesday that the extradition battle was \"a question of life and death\" for Assange. \n\n           Assange was arrested last month after his   and Ecuador revoked his political asylum. \n     Lawyers have said Assange will fight extradition to the U.S., where authorities have charged him with conspiring to break into a Pentagon computer system. The   shows that Assange has been charged with computer hacking crimes for trying to illegally access \"secret\" materials on a U.S. government computer. The charge is officially listed as \"conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.\" The indictment accuses Assange of trying to access the secret material \"with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States and the advantage of any foreign nation.\" The charges relate to materials stolen by former Army intelligence analyst  , who was convicted in 2013 of leaking classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks. She had   and was arrested in 2010. Manning is transgender and at the time of her arrest, her name was Bradley. \n\n           Manning was jailed again in March for refusing to testify to a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton ordered Manning to jail for contempt of court after a brief hearing in which Manning confirmed she had no intention of testifying. The case against Assange in Sweden was   -- not because of any conclusion about his guilt or innocence, but because they accepted there wasn't any reasonable chance of prosecuting him as he remained holed-up in London. Swedish lawyer Elisabeth Massi Fritz, who represents one of the claimants behind the sexual abuse allegations, said shortly after Assange's arrest that it had \"understandably come as a shock to my client that what we have been waiting and hoping for since 2012 has now finally happened.\" \n     Massi Fritz said in a tweet that she and her team would \"do everything we possibly can to get the Swedish police investigation re-opened so that Assange can be extradited to Sweden and prosecuted for rape. No rape victim should have to wait 9 years to see justice be served.\" Her client has claimed Assange had sex with her without a condom while she was asleep. In Sweden, having sex with an unconscious, drunk or sleeping person can lead to a rape conviction punishable by up to six years in prison.  Swedish law experts and Assange's own lawyer in Sweden have said, however, that it appears unlikely a new extradition request will be issued by the Scandinavian nation, simply due to the amount of time that has passed. \"I think it would be a very uphill task to reopen the investigation in Sweden,\" Britain's Guardian quoted former prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhemas telling a Swedish news agency. \"Testimony usually weakens with time, and it's now been 10 years.\" If Swedish prosecutors do decide to reopen their investigation and issue a new arrest warrant for Assange, it will be down to U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid to make the decision on which request to honor -- if any. More than 70 British legislators have urged Javid to give priority to a case involving rape allegations ahead of the U.S. request, if Sweden reopens the case. \n\n           A U.S. official told CBS News justice correspondent Paula Reid that even with an official U.S. request now filed with Britain, extradition is a lengthy process and the WikiLeaks boss was likely hit U.S. soil quickly. \n     That said, Britain and the U.S. do have a fast-track extradition agreement, so the process should be easier than it would be with many other nations. Assange would not be expected to enter a plea to the Department of Justice charge unless he loses his extradition case in the U.K. and is brought to a courtroom in the United States.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/01/3801983a-cb4f-4d11-b25c-f7d305b734d3/thumbnail/620x413/1418fbaa6794139b58bc3169e65b0e65/julian-assange-1140444488.jpg#\" alt=\"BRITAIN-US-ECUADOR-AUSTRALIA-DIPLOMACY-COURT-ASSANGE \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/01/3801983a-cb4f-4d11-b25c-f7d305b734d3/thumbnail/620x413/1418fbaa6794139b58bc3169e65b0e65/julian-assange-1140444488.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/01/3801983a-cb4f-4d11-b25c-f7d305b734d3/thumbnail/1240x826/d9c5943cc40ee29d78d3bd1f9695d770/julian-assange-1140444488.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104030", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue.

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added.

They said he developed symptoms of an illness the day after he arrived at a shelter in Texas.  \n     According to the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry, the boy died Tuesday of a \"severe infection in the frontal lobe\" of the brain. The teen was picked up by border patrol after he crossed into El Paso, Texas on April 19, Guatemalan officials said. On the evening of April 20, he was transferred by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Southwest Key Casa Padre shelter in Brownsville, which is run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). \n  \n  \n\n \n \"Upon arrival to the shelter the minor did not note any health concerns,\" Evelyn Stauffer, a spokesperson for the Administration for Children and Families, which oversees ORR, said in a statement to CBS News. Children placed in ORR custody are typically given an initial medical examination by staff doctors within 48 hours of arriving at shelters, but because the boy arrived in the evening he had not yet received one, the agency said. \"On the morning of April 21, 2019 the minor became noticeably ill including fever, chills and a headache,\" Stauffer said. The boy was brought to a hospital emergency room that morning and released later that day. When his health had not improved by the next day, he was brought to a different hospital, and later transferred to a children's hospital in Texas, Stauffer said. The agency did not say which specific hospitals treated him, but the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry said he was taken to Driscoll Children's Hospital in Driscoll, Texas, where he underwent surgery \"to stabilize the pressure inside the head area.\"  \n     \"Following several days of intensive care, the minor passed away at the hospital on April 30, 2019,\" the Administration for Children and Families statement said. The boy's death was first reported by BuzzFeed News. The boy is the third migrant child to die in U.S. custody since December. Seven-year-old Jackeline Caal died in the custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Dec. 8, 2018,  . Eight-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo  , in border patrol custody after developing the flu. Two children have died in ORR custody since 2015, and three in the program's history, which dates back to 1980.   During the boy's hospitalization, he received visits from his brother, who was already in the United States, and Guatemalan consular officials. Stauffer said his family \"received frequent updates from hospital staff.\" U.S. officials did not release any more details about his medical condition, and said the boy's cause of death is under review. \"In accordance with standard ORR policies and procedures, the case will be subject to a full review,\" Stauffer said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/23/7d844ad8-5461-44d3-9e5d-d92dc12f5d97/thumbnail/640x360/a5fe9fc64b4cac98e19d0bd3091c8315/gettyimages-945288792.jpg#\" alt=\"ICE Arrests Undocumented Immigrants In NYC \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/23/7d844ad8-5461-44d3-9e5d-d92dc12f5d97/thumbnail/640x360/a5fe9fc64b4cac98e19d0bd3091c8315/gettyimages-945288792.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/23/7d844ad8-5461-44d3-9e5d-d92dc12f5d97/thumbnail/1280x720/d7ce69abe8c8692ee84615ea315878fb/gettyimages-945288792.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104030", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Orion's thermal protection system is one of the most critical parts of the spacecraft intended to facilitate human exploration of asteroids and of Mars. It consists of the spacecraft's main heat shield that faces into the atmosphere on reentry to slow the spaceship down and also the grid of tiles known as the back shell. During Orion's next mission atop the agency's Space Launch System rocket, called Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the spacecraft will be in space for more than three weeks and return to Earth under even faster and hotter conditions than during its last flight. \"As we move towards building the system for EM-1, we've been able to take advantage of what we learned from building and flying Orion to refine our processes going forward,\" said John Kowal, NASA's thermal protection system lead for Orion. During EM-1, Orion will endure a more intense re-entry environment. While the spacecraft encountered speeds of 30,000 feet per second during Exploration Flight Test-1 and temperatures of approximately 2,204 degrees Celsius, it will experience a faster return from lunar velocity of about 36,000 feet per second. The speed difference may seem subtle, but the heating the vehicle sees increases exponentially as the speed increases. Engineering teams are preparing Orion's heat shield to perform re-entry during any of missions planned near the Moon or in high lunar orbit in the coming years. For these future Orion missions, a silver, metallic-based thermal control coating will be bonded to the crew module's thermal protection system back shell tiles. The coating, similar to what is used on the main heat shield, will reduce heat loss during phases when Orion is pointed to space and therefore experiencing cold temperatures, as well as limit the high temperatures the crew module will be subjected to when the spacecraft faces the Sun. The coating will help Orion's back shell maintain a temperature range from approximately minus 101 to 287 degrees Celsius prior to entry and also will protect against electrical surface charges in space and during re-entry. Engineers have also refined the design in ways that improve the manufacturing process and reduce the mass of the spacecraft for the upcoming exploration missions. Instead of a monolithic outer layer, the heat shield will be made of about 180 blocks that can be made simultaneously with the other heat shield components to streamline the labour-and-time-intensive manufacturing process. In addition, engineers have found ways to reduce the mass of the heat shield's underlying structure, which is composed of a titanium skeleton and carbon fiber skin. Teams have optimised the thickness of the skeleton and the skin based on the pressures that different areas will experience during flight and reentry, adding more fidelity to the overall structure while allowing it to be lighter.

Should the calculation not match experimental results, it would be conclusive evidence of new, unknown phenomena that lie outside of the Standard Model--physicists' present understanding of the fundamental particles and the forces between them. The current result does not yet indicate such a difference between experiment and theory, but scientists expect the precision of the calculation to improve dramatically now that they've proven they can tackle the task.

He had a dream that Siraj would play for India in Test cricket. Within a month of his death, my brother has got that god-sent opportunity. It is one of the best news in recent times,’’ brother Ismail, a software Engineer, said from their Toli Chowki residence after hearing that his brother Mohd Siraj will make his Test debut against Australia in Melbourne on Saturday. Ghouse had passed away on November 19. “It was one of the biggest losses for our family. Siraj was inconsolable when he heard that `Abba jaan’ had died. We had great difficulty in controlling his emotions from here to Australia. He was very low in confidence and contemplated at one point even coming back to India. Luckily the Indian team members, particularly Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri, played a big role in consoling him,’’ added Ismail. Ismail pointed out: “My father would always say to Siraj make India proud. Desh Ko Roshan Karo. He always had a proud feeling whenever Siraj played for India. There was always a big smile on his face and sense of satisfaction whenever Siraj donned the Indian colours.’’ From the quaint lanes of Khaja Nagar in Banjara Hills, 26-year-old Siraj has fulfilled his father’s dreams. “We came through a lot of hardships. Being an autorickshaw driver, my father and mother Shabana Begum did all sundry works. I was studious while Siraj was always busy playing cricket in the small lanes. My mother was often upset because Siraj never focused his attention on studies. She would often beat him saying that he is wasting his career by playing the game. “But my father always supported Siraj. He would quietly slip in money in Siraj’s pocket and encouraged him to play cricket. Siraj was very passionate about the game and fast bowling. Today, we are all happy that he is going to play for India in Test cricket, that too at the magnificent MCG ground. He would be having my father’s blessings from heaven. It is a big moment for our family,’’ said Ismail, who had passed his engineering in 2014 and now acts as a manager for his brother. Siraj had moved to Toli Chowki where he could give best comforts to his parents. “We have not sold our father’s auto. He proudly travelled in Jeep Compass in the last few years.’’ Former chairman of National selection Committee MSK Prasad said he always believed Siraj had the potential to play for India. “He is one of the successful cricketers in India A matches. He has taken six or more five-wicket hauls that too against big teams. We thought he was a very good red-ball cricket as he could move the late and was a work-horse.’’ P Jyothi Prasad, who was the chairman of the Hyderabad selection committee when Siraj made his Ranji debut in 2014-15 season, said this Hyderabad fast bowler always excited him. “He had the hunger to excel in big stage.’’ Siraj will be the second Hyderabad fast bowler after Syed Abid Ali, who incidentally made his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide way back in 1966, to play for India in Test cricket. Former Hyderabad opener Abdul Azeem, who was instrumental in shaping Siraj’s career when he gave him cricket shoes etc, said God is great. “I have seen the hardships the family went through. He deserves all the luck.’’ Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

The first person at the home to be immunized with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 101-year-old Edith Kwoizalla, the DPA news agency reported. Krueger said 40 of the home’s 59 residents wanted the immunization shot along with 10 of around 40 workers. He was among those immunized but added, “I also understand the concerns.” In Hungary, health care workers were vaccinated at the Southern Pest Central Hospital in Budapest, while in Slovakia, the first person to receive a jab was a 60-year-old top expert on infectious diseases, Vladimir Krcmery. He was vaccinated along with doctors at the University Hospital in the city of Nitra, in what Health Minister Marek Krajci called a “historic moment.” The first shipments of the vaccine arrived at hospitals across the EU in super-cold containers late Friday and early Saturday after being sent from a manufacturing center in Belgium before Christmas. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen released a video celebrating the vaccine rollout for the bloc of nearly 450 million people, calling it “a touching moment of unity.” “Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year. The COVID-19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries. Vaccination will begin tomorrow across the EU,” she said. The rollout marks a moment of hope for a region that includes some of the world’s earliest and worst-hit virus hot spots — Italy and Spain — and others like the Czech Republic, which were spared early on only to see their health care systems near their breaking point in the fall. In all, EU nations have recorded at least 16 million coronavirus infections and more than 336,000 deaths — huge numbers that experts agree still understate the true toll of the pandemic due to missed cases and limited testing. Still, the vaccine rollout helps the bloc project a sense of unity in a complex lifesaving mission after it faced a year of difficulties in negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain. It also brings a sigh of relief for EU politicians who were frustrated after Britain, Canada and the United States began their vaccination programs earlier this month with the same German-developed shot. “It’s here, the good news at Christmas,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference Saturday. “This vaccine is the decisive key to end this pandemic … it is the key to getting our lives back.” The first shipments were limited to just under 10,000 doses in most countries, with the EU’s mass vaccination programs expected to begin only in January. Each country is deciding on its own who will get the first shots — but they are all putting the most vulnerable first. In Hungary, the first shipment of 9,750 doses — enough to vaccinate 4,875 people, since two doses are needed per person — arrived by truck early Saturday and were taken to the South Pest Central Hospital in Budapest. The government said four other hospitals, two in Budapest and two others in the eastern cities of Debrecen and Nyíregyháza, would also receive vaccines from the initial shipment. French authorities said they will prioritize the elderly and the French medical safety agency will monitor the vaccine rollout for any potential problems. Germany, where the pandemic has cost more than 30,000 lives, was beginning with those over 80 and people who take care of vulnerable groups. Spanish authorities said the first batch of the vaccine arrived in the central city of Guadalajara, where the first shots will be administered Sunday morning at a nursing home. In Italy, which has Europe’s worst virus toll at over 71,000 dead, a nurse in Rome’s Spallanzani Hospital, the main infectious diseases facility in the capital, will be the first in the country to receive the vaccine, followed by other health care personnel. In Poland, the first two people to be vaccinated Sunday will be a nurse and a doctor at the Interior Ministry hospital in Warsaw, followed by medical personnel in dozens of other hospitals. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said it was the patriotic duty of Poles to get vaccinated — a message directed at a society where there’s a high degree of vaccine hesitancy born from a distrust of authorities. In Bulgaria, where fears about vaccines also run high, the first person to get the shot will be Health Minister Kostadin Angelov, who has promised an aggressive campaign to promote the benefits of vaccines. In Croatia, a nursing home resident in Zagreb, the capital, will be the first to receive the vaccine on Sunday morning, according to state HRT TV. Authorities also planned to involve celebrities and other public figures in a pro-vaccination campaign. “We have been waiting for this for a year now,” Romanian Prime Minister Florin Catu said Saturday after the first vaccines arrived at a military-run storage facility. The vaccinations began as the first cases of a new virus variant that has been spreading in the U.K. have been detected in France and Spain. The new variant, which British authorities said is much more easily transmitted, has caused European countries, the United States and China to put new restrictions on travel for people from Britain. A French man living in England arrived in France on Dec. 19 and tested positive for the new variant Friday, the French health agency said. He has no symptoms and is isolating at home in the central city of Tours. Health authorities in Madrid confirmed the U.K. variant in four people, all of whom are in good health. Regional health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero said the new strain had arrived when an infected person flew into Madrid’s airport. The German pharmaceutical company  that its coronavirus vaccine works against the new U.K. variant, but said further studies are needed to be completely certain. ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

The Indian weather service   Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Fani was expected to make landfall on Friday afternoon in Odisha state and barrel northeast on a pathway close to the homes of more than 100 million people. \n     A state relief department official told AFP that 780,000 people were moved to safer places overnight from at least 13 districts of Odisha, home to some 46 million people, which will bear the brunt of the weather system. \"We are expecting more than a million people to move out of the danger zone in next 12 hours,\" Bishnupada Sethi, Odisha Special Relief Commissioner, told AFP. \n\n    \n           Some 3,000 shelters in schools and government buildings have been set up to accommodate more than a million people. More than 100,000 dry food packets are ready to be dropped if needed, reports said. \n  \n  \n\n \n On Thursday the storm, which reports said would be the biggest to hit eastern India in nearly two decades, was brewing in the Bay of Bengal about 155 miles offshore and moving slowly but ominously to the west. CBS News contributing meteorologist Jeff Berardelli says Bay of Bengal cyclones can be the deadliest on the planet because the region is so low-lying, exposing densely-populated coastal areas to extreme storm surges. He notes that there is also hilly terrain in the region, so mudslides are common. Berardelli says cyclones in the area would often kill hundreds of thousands of people in years gone by, but better warning and evacuation systems implemented in the last two decades have cut down dramatically on deaths. \n\n    \n           The cyclone was expected to pack sustained wind speeds of up to 118 miles per hour, with gusts up to 125 mph -- equivalent in strength to a Category 3 to 4 hurricane. \n     Fani was expected to make landfall near the Hindu holy town of Puri, a major tourist hotspot attracting millions of Indian and foreign visitors every year. More than 100 trains were cancelled in in the two days before Thursday, according to a statement by Indian Railways. Three special trains were running from Puri to evacuate pilgrims and tourists. Authorities have asked tourists to leave coastal areas and avoid unnecessary travel. Special buses were deployed in Puri and other towns to get them out. Dozens of officials were making announcements on hand-held megaphones across the coastal belt asking residents to leave their homes for safety. The Indian Navy was also put on alert. \"Our men are urging people to move to safer places and government has set up sufficient shelters to take in those evacuating their homes,\" said Sethi, the emergency coordinator. \"Heavy rains are expected in all the coastal districts amid fears of flash floods. We are all geared up for the challenge.\" \n     Forecasters have predicted \"heavy to very heavy\" rain on Friday in some places and \"extremely heavy\" rain the next day, with some areas inundated by up to 8 inches of water. Tides could also surge up to five feet. India's weather office has warned that the high speed winds can uproot trees, flatten crops and damage homes, power and communication infrastructure. The neighboring coastal states of Andhra Pradesh, home to 50 million people, and Tamil Nadu, population some 70 million, have also been put on high alert. Fani will be the fourth such storm to hit India's east coast in three decades. Major weather systems regularly affect eastern and southeast India between April and December.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/648eb139-5ca8-4a12-95fd-d04fe07d1f65/thumbnail/620x413/b02f10b4063b3d164d89f27c0948cacf/cyclone-fani-india-1140763083.jpg#\" alt=\"INDIA-WEATHER-FANI-CYCLONE \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/648eb139-5ca8-4a12-95fd-d04fe07d1f65/thumbnail/620x413/b02f10b4063b3d164d89f27c0948cacf/cyclone-fani-india-1140763083.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/648eb139-5ca8-4a12-95fd-d04fe07d1f65/thumbnail/1240x826/e10555c7b92ff50e695af94c78df1843/cyclone-fani-india-1140763083.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104031", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

However, it was debutant Shubman Gill who gave a good start with a 61-odd run partnership with Cheteshwar Pujara after losing another opener Mayank Agarwal for a duck on the first day. The Punjab lad scored a steady 45-run knock and looked comfortable against a top-quality bowling attack consisting Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. Speaking about his game plan, he said:“When I came into bat, the ball was doing a bit and the pitch was lively. The only thing I told myself was no matter what is happening on the pitch I should be able to play my game and express myself. My goal was to give my team a good start. When we lost Mayank early, my chat with Pujara was to take this partnership as deep as possible.” When asked about the talk from the captain before the innings, he said, “Rahane didn’t tell me anything in particular. I had some plans and expectations from myself and my plan should match the team. I was talking to batting coach (Vikram Rathour) and head coach Ravi sir on how to approach this game.” Despite playing his first Test, he looked comfortable at the crease and he said playing the likes of Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar in nets gave him confidence. “I have been travelling with the team for the last four five Test series and it helped me settle in the team. I was able to bat in nets against Bhuvi, Bumrah and Shami bhai and it was a big confidence booster for a youngster like me. When I went into bat today, I didn’t feel like I was out of place. I was confident,” added the youngster. But he was disappointed with the way he got out. “After the way I got out, I am not really satisfied with the innings. That was the last ball of the Cummin’s spell and I should have seen it off. It was a loose shot to play. Overall, I wanted to play with intent and stretch the partnership. But it was disappointing to get out like that.” He was all praise for Rahane’s knock and said it was a learning lesson for him to watch his innings. “His knock was all about being patient. When you are playing a high quality attack sometimes you go into that shell and not score runs. But the way he batted, he saw off tough periods and scored runs. Watching the innings was educational. Jadeja’s knock was also crucial. After losing five wickets, we could have easily surrendered the advantage. But they both played brilliantly to forge a good partnership. Hopefully, we will score as many runs as possible on the board and get the Australians out for a low total as batting on this wicket in the fourth innings can get very tough. The wicket will have more cracks and a lot of spin on the offer,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

May accused Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson of leaking details of private government discussions on Chinese telecommunications company  .  \n     Williamson was fired late Wednesday by May, who said she had seen \"compelling evidence\" that he was behind media reports that the government had agreed -- against the advice of the United States -- to let   wireless communications network. It was the first time in decades that a senior minister has been fired over leaks of sensitive information. \n  \n  \n\n \n Williamson hit back, telling Sky News that the investigation had been a \"witch hunt\" and claiming he was the victim of a \"kangaroo court with a summary execution.\" Allies of Williamson rallied to his support, demanding that May's government publish the evidence against him. \n\n           \"Natural justice requires that the evidence is produced so that his reputation can be salvaged or utterly destroyed,\" said Conservative lawmaker Desmond Swayne. The firing of Williamson was a dramatic display of the divisions and ill-discipline that is roiling Britain's Conservative-led government. \n     With May weakened by her failure so far to  , multiple ministers are positioning themselves to try to replace her, partly by cultivating positive press coverage. Williamson was named in a Daily Telegraph report last week as being one of several ministers alleged to have opposed letting Huawei work on Britain's 5G infrastructure. The United States has been lobbying allies including Britain to exclude Huawei from all 5G networks, arguing that the Chinese government can force the company to give it backdoor access to data on its networks. \n\n           Opposition Labour Party deputy leader Tom Watson said the leak from a top-secret meeting of Britain's National Security Council was \"indicative of the malaise and sickness at the heart of this ailing government.\" He called for a criminal investigation into leaks from the security council, which is made up of senior ministers who receive briefings from military and intelligence chiefs. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the government did not plan to refer the matter to police. \"But we would of course cooperate fully should the police themselves consider that an investigation were necessary,\" he told lawmakers. \n     Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick, however, said the force would only investigate if it received a complaint.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/b5c7b3c3-b089-4864-af89-43969add9498/thumbnail/620x413/7eb0816285266f22ff0ea7699e32419c/gavin-williamson-967593784.jpg#\" alt=\"Government Ministers Attend Cabinet After Whitsun Break \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/b5c7b3c3-b089-4864-af89-43969add9498/thumbnail/620x413/7eb0816285266f22ff0ea7699e32419c/gavin-williamson-967593784.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/02/b5c7b3c3-b089-4864-af89-43969add9498/thumbnail/1240x826/9c5aea1b0a6afa5563f42f0d43eec861/gavin-williamson-967593784.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104031", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.

At the same time, tensions grew within NATO as Turkey defied growing condemnation from its Western allies of its invasion across the border. Now in its seventh day, Turkey’s offensive against the Kurds has upended alliances and is re-drawing the map of northern Syria for yet another time in Syria’s 8-year-old war. U.S. rival Russia was quickly moving to entrench its de facto power broker role after President Donald Trump ordered the pullout of American forces in northeast Syria. The American move   and opened the door for the Turkish invasion aimed at crushing them. Desperate for a new protector, the Kurdish administration   with the Russian-backed government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose forces began on Sunday   to shield them against Turkey. A video posted online by Russian journalists travelling with the soldiers showed what appeared to be an abandoned outpost where American troops had been stationed earlier. Syrian troops waved flags in the city streets. Outside Manbij, Russian troops began patrolling front lines between Turkish and Syrian army positions to keep them separated, Russia’s Defense Ministry said. “No one is interested” in potential fighting between Syrian government troops and Turkish forces, Russia’s envoy for Syria Alexander Lavrentyev told Russian state news agencies. Russia “is not going to allow it,” he said. Lavrentyev confirmed that Kurdish leaders and representatives of the Syrian government held talks at a Russian military base last week but said that he was not aware of any results. Still, fighting flared near Manbij, a town west of the Euphrates River that Turkey has long wanted to wrest from Kurdish control. A mortar attack from Manbij hit Turkish forces, killing one soldier and wounding eight others, Turkey’s Defense Ministry said. The Turkish military retaliated with an assault that “neutralized” an estimated 15 Syrian Kurdish fighters, the ministry added. Further east along the border, Kurdish fighters battled trying to retake the town of Ras al-Ayn, which was captured by Turkish forces days earlier. An Associated Press journalist reported heavy Turkish bombardment of targets in the countryside around Ras al-Ayn early Tuesday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, reported that Syrian Kurdish fighters had retaken the town. But it appeared it was still being contested, and Turkish media said the military was responding to attempts by the Kurdish fighters to infiltrate Ras al-Ayn. Russia and Assad’s stride into place alongside the once U.S.-allied Kurds came as the United States tried to restrain the invasion by fellow NATO member Turkey. Targeting Turkey’s economy, Trump on Monday announced sanctions aimed at restraining the Turks’ assault. The United States also called on Turkey to stop the offensive and declare a cease-fire, while European Union countries moved to broaden an arms sale embargo against their easternmost ally. \n Washington said Trump was sending Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Robert O’Brien to Ankara as soon as possible in an attempt to begin negotiations over a stop to the fighting. Pence said Trump spoke directly to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised not to attack the border town of Kobani, which in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group’s first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters. Erdogan defended Turkey’s offensive in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, calling on the international community to support Turkey’s effort to create what it calls a resettlement “safe zone” for refugees in northeast Syria, or “begin admitting refugees.” “Turkey reached its limit,” Erdogan wrote in reference to 3.6 million Syrian refugees in his country. He said Turkey’s warnings that it would not be able to stop refugee floods into the West without international support “fell on deaf ears.” Turkey invaded northern Syria aiming to create a zone of control the entire length of the border and drive out the Kurdish fighters, which it considers terrorists because of their links to Kurdish insurgents within Turkey. Instead, after the Kurds’ deal with Damascus, a new de facto carving up of the border appeared to be taking shape. Turkish forces control a truncated zone roughly in the center of the border about 100 kilometers (60 miles) long between the towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ain. Syrian government troops were moving into or beefing up their presence in the regions on either side of that enclave, including Manbij west of it, and the cities of Qamishli and Hassakeh in the far northeastern corner of Syria. With their deal with Damascus, the Kurds risk losing the virtual self-rule they have enjoyed across the northeast — the heartland of their minority community — ever since Assad had to pull his troops out of the area seven years ago to fight rebels elsewhere. They are hoping, perhaps with Russian mediation, to reach a final deal that would preserve some degree of that autonomy. But they gain protection: So far, Turkey appears reluctant to clash with Syrian forces wherever they move in. The main Kurdish-led force in Syria said it has lost 23 fighters in clashes with advancing Turkish-led forces over the past day, mainly at Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad. That raises the total of casualties announced by the group to 68 dead. Separately, two people were killed in a new mortar and rocket attack by Syrian Kurdish fighters on a Turkish town bordering Syria, local officials said. The attack on the town of Kiziltepe, Mardin province, also wounded 12 other civilians, the governor’s office said. Turkish officials say 18 civilians — excluding Tuesday’s victims — have been killed in a barrage of mortar and rocket shells fired on towns located on the Turkish border provinces of Mardin, Sanliurfa, Sirnak and Gaziantep, since the operation began on Oct. 9. The U.N. humanitarian aid coordinator said at least 160,000 civilians in northeastern Syria have been displaced amid the Turkish operations, mostly from Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad, where people are fleeing south. Separately, spokesman Rupert Colville of the U.N. human rights office said it was “not seeing large numbers of civilian casualties” so far — “a few each day” — but people were being killed on both sides of the Syria-Turkey border. He cautioned: “Obviously we’re not necessarily hearing all cases, either.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104031", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing.

There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.

The typical Hyderabadi dialect commonly used in Irani hotels, play fields or among teammates brought smiles among the citizens from the land of the Musi. The conversation went somewhere on these lines: Sridhar: Aaj shaam mein mere saath hain Mohammed Siraj joh hamara Hyderabad ke ek dam ustad fast bowler pehle Test match MCG Boxing Day Test mei. VVS Laxman ke baad tum pehle Hyderbadi ho jo Hyderabad mein paida hua aur India ko debut kiya. Aap ka aaj kya maholl thaa aur kya lagrah thaa? (Today we have Hyderabad ustad and Hyderabad fast bowler. That too on Boxing Day at MCG. After Laxman you are the born and brought up in Hyderabad to make debut for India. How is the atmosphere and how are you feeling?) Siraj replies: Mero Ko tho bahut hi acha lag rah thaa. Jaise ground mein utra aur jaise cap milee debut mein matlab sabse life mein bada achievement tha. Aur jaise mein ground mein utra, lunch tak ball nahi milee aur jaise drinks hua uske baad bowlers ne bahut acha kiye aur mere koh bhi Ajju bhai mujhse baat kar ke confident deh rahe the ke acha laaga aur mere baaju mein Jesse bhai the confident deh reh the. (I am feeling very happy. As soon as I entered the ground and when I made my debut it was my life’s biggest achievement. I entered the ground but I didn’t get bowling till lunch. The bowlers bowled beautifully. Ajju bhai (Ajinkya Rahane) gave me confident and so was Jesse) Sridhar: Doosra sawal yeh pooch na tha, lunch tak ball nahi haath laga toh dimag mein kya chaal rah tha? Haatha khujara thaa kya?(Second question, till lunch you couldn’t get the ball. What was going through your mind and were your hands itching?) Suraj: Haatha tho khujara rah thaa. Ajju bhai bolre the ki end mein aana. Uske ke baad bolthe toh aur warm up kiya. Mein bhi socha thaa theek hai wicket mein moisture hoga tho spinner ko helpful hain. Uske baad mein mai socha thaa run out mein kuch contribution karunga and confident bhi thaa. Uske lunch ke baad aya tho mera ek plan tha tho dot ball jaada dalun aur pressure build karoon kyun ki uske baad pressure mein wicket mileage (My hands were itching. Ajju bhai told me I would come from this end and I was warming up. I thought I would contribute by making a run out. After lunch, I had a plan to bowl dot balls and build pressure and then get wicket). Sridhar: Aacha yeh pahle batao mujhe pehle cheh ball swing nahi hoh raha thaa uske baad doosra spell aap dono taraf idhar udhar swing kar reh the. Kya toh bhi woh kissa? (You didn’t swing the first six balls but in the second spell you could swing the ball both ways. What was this about?) Siraj: Woh toh natural hai sir. Mein yeh try kar rah tha ki matlab thoda close stumps aah raa thaa and uske baad mein wide off stumps daal raa tha. Mera angle natural in swing tha and aur bhi swing hoh raha tha. (It is natural for me sir. I was bowling close to the stumps and then bowled outside the off stump. I have natural in swing) Sridhar: Cameron Green ko zabardast set kiye aur uske baad zabardast catchaan pakde outfield mein? (You set up Green nicely and took fine catches in the outfield) Siraj: Cameron ghiri tika tho jab mera bahar bhi acha aur andar bhi acha aah rah thaa. . Usko andhar andhar dala thaa uske baad do over usko bahar dala but eek dum eek ball andhar daala thaa. Bahut acha laga set kar ke. Jaisa fielding ki tension nahi thi woh yeh cheez ki. (I was bowling outswingers and I bowled with inswingers but I brought one in nicely. There was no tension while fielding). The Hyderabadi lingo brought memories to many past cricketers. Former fast bowler Rajesh Yadav and former wicketkeeper Youraj Singh said it was always fun when we talk in Hyderabad dialect. Words like haule, chillar kahin, dimagh hi nah hai, bewakoof. P Harimohan, echoed the same feeling. “The lingo is so unique that whoever hears it can’t help laughing.

Opposition supporters have rallied for weeks, urging Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down over the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim control over large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. The Russia-brokered agreement ended 44 days of fierce fighting in which the Azerbaijani army routed Armenian forces. Pashinyan has defended the peace deal as a painful but necessary move to prevent Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region. He argued Friday that his critics lack broad public support for their demand. “I’m not clinging to the prime minister’s seat, but I can’t carelessly treat the post given to me by the people,” he said on Facebook. Pashinyan added that he was ready to hold consultations with the nation’s political parties to discuss calling an early parliamentary election next year. Opposition supporters on Friday continued blocking streets in the Armenian capital and engaged in occasional scuffles with police. Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands. Heavy fighting that erupted in late September marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 5,600 people on both sides. The Russia-brokered peace agreement stipulated that Armenia hand over control of some areas it holds outside Nagorno-Karabakh’s borders. Azerbaijan also retained control over areas of Nagorno-Karabakh it had taken during the conflict. The peace deal was celebrated in Azerbaijan as a major triumph, and triggered outrage and mass protests in Armenia.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104032", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb announced the figure at a Cabinet meeting Thursday. The government didn’t indicate whether the vaccines were purchased or provided by Covax, the global project to provide vaccines to developing countries, or a combination of both. His ministry said Friday that Morocco has not yet received the vaccines. Mustapha Ennaji Moulay, head of the virology department at the Hassan II University in Casablanca and a member of the government’s COVID-19 scientific committee, said that regulators are reviewing the Sinopharm vaccine’s documentation, and that the vaccination program is expected to begin in the coming days. Morocco has one of the most advanced vaccination plans in the region. The country has also reported the second-highest number of virus infections and deaths in Africa, after South Africa. The Moroccan health minister said the government’s target is vaccinating 25 million of the country’s 36 million people, all free of charge, according to orders from King Mohammed VI. While the Moroccan government has been promising vaccinations since earlier this month, the minister said preparations have now reached a “very advanced” stage. He said authorities were carrying out simulations at all the immunization sites “to avoid any obstacles that may arise during the implementation of the vaccination program.” In a first phase, the vaccine will be administered to medical personnel, public authorities, security services, education workers and people suffering from chronic diseases. The Ministry of Health said it has deployed a computerized system to register the target population and track their health status after they receive the vaccine. Moulay said Morocco has sought to diversify supply by signing contracts with multiple countries. Morocco has said it will start its vaccination program with the Sinopharm vaccine, though it hasn’t yet completed advanced trials to prove that it’s safe and effective. The vaccine, which was tested on 600 Moroccans as part of clinical trials this autumn, has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in multiple countries. Morocco’s initial vaccine deliveries will come from China, but Morocco also plans to produce the vaccine locally. The AstraZeneca vaccine is still in advanced trials in countries including Britain and the U.S. and hasn’t been approved yet. Morocco’s daily virus case count has fallen slightly in the last two weeks, but a dip in testing is raising concerns that the virus could be spreading faster than reported. As a preventive measure to curb the spread of the virus during New Year’s celebrations, authorities banned public and private gatherings, closed restaurants in the country’s main cities, and imposed a curfew that went into effect Wednesday night and is set to last for three weeks.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104033", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The teen was picked up by border patrol after he crossed into El Paso, Texas on April 19, Guatemalan officials said.

However, the experienced coach Manolo Marquez Roca feels the result will not affect their morale going into their next match against Kerala Blasters. Speaking on the eve of their ISL clash against strugglers Kerala, who are placed at ninth without a win yet, the Spaniard felt Mumbai City FC were a strong team and they were good on the day. “In football, there are three possibilities: win, draw or loss. It is impossible to maintain only one. After losing one game, no team becomes bad. I think the loss against Mumbai does not affect our team for tomorrow’s game. We will go out to play a good game and win tomorrow,” he said. On being asked about the loss against strong opponents Mumbai and not converting the chances, he said, “I don’t think we created too many chances. I only remember one clear chance from (Mohammad) Yasir one minute before the half time. With the equaliser, the second half would have been different. But with a young and inexperienced side, I am happy with the way they played in the second half.” Speaking about their opponents Kerala Blasters, he rated the team very high on talent. “For me it is a very good team. They played an open game in the championship against ATK and they didn’t deserve to lose. In the last game, they equalised in injury time. They have got good players and they deserve more points than what they have now. For sure it will be a tough battle,” he added. When asked about major changes in the upcoming game, he said he does not believe in changing the team because of one loss. “There are a few areas from the Mumbai game where we can improve and change some players maybe. We are not going to make too many tactical changes and we played six games and had only one loss. Can’t change too many things.” He said talented Indian player Nikhil Poojary will be out of this game owing to injuries. “You don’t win games on revealing who is playing or not. For me, the squad is of 29 players and 28 players were training and only one player was out with injury. All other players are in the contention for a place.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the recent passing away of Siraj’s father, the celebrations were muted and confined to indoors. But the family members of the fast bowler, who made his Test debut against Australia on Saturday, were excited while they followed the game on the television. The moment Siraj took to the field with his teammates, his mother Shabana Begum’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. Speaking after watching his son don Indian colours, she said her husband’s (Mohammed Ghouse) dream finally fulfilled. “  (It is all the grace of Almighty). Thanks to God, his father would be proud of him today,” she said. When asked about their feeling ahead of his debut, she said, “We got up very early to watch him play. We were excited and happy. But when he took the field and stood there with his teammates singing the national anthem, it brought us tears.” Siraj had a wonderful debut picking up two crucial wickets that helped India skittle out Australia for 195 runs on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. When asked about their feeling after Siraj picked up his first wicket, Shabana said, “We can’t express the feeling. Playing for country has always been his and his father’s dream. Now he made the country proud.” Shabana, who was worried for Siraj for neglecting his studies and focusing on cricket, added she wants her son to win matches for India. Siraj’s grandmother Sardar Bhi said that the family was delighted. “Due to his father’s death, the family mourning will continue for three months. So we told Siraj’s friends not to come to the house for watching the match. We know they are all excited to share their joy with us. But this is a tough time.” “We started getting calls early in the morning when he took those two wickets. We switched off our mobiles and kept it aside to watch the match,” she added. Siraj’s brother Mohammed Ismail said he was over the moon. “I wasn’t feeling well in the morning, so I watched till lunch and slept off. But I have been receiving calls from people congratulating us. It is a great moment for our family,” he added. A long time friend of Siraj, Mohd Shafi said that he is poised for greater things. “I am very happy to see Siraj playing for the country. If his father was here, he would have been very happy. I spoke to his mother, she was also very happy. I spoke to Siraj as well after the first day’s game. He said if people support him, he would do many great things for the country. Siraj revealed that it is just the start and he has been working very hard.” Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

As we saw in the first debate last month, he is rude, raging and red-faced. An honest debate should reveal that. His 128 interruptions revealed the true Trump. Muting him only protects him from the consequences of his out of control behavior.  Of course, even with the camera focused away from Trump, it is likely that live microphones on Joe Biden and on the moderator, NBC's Kristen Welker, might pick up Trump's interruptions. But the sound will be muffled, muted and less authentic to this President. The audience at home might even find the low-level buzzing of any interjections more distracting than the full-throated interruptions, or wonder if perhaps a stagehand was making the noise. Trump's outbursts will be heard by Biden and Welker, however. Thus, Trump will have the power to potentially throw Biden -- or Welker -- off their game, without viewers realizing why. This, it seems to me, is the best of all worlds for Trump: He can work to discombobulate Biden or Welker without viewers blaming him.  The first debate, aptly described by my CNN colleague Dana Bash as \"a sh** show,\" cost Trump dearly.  A staggering six in 10 voters thought Biden won the debate. On the day of the debate, Biden led Trump in the Five Thirty Eight polling average by 7.1%. Ten days later the spread had increased to over 10 points. For a race as stable as this to move by a net of 3 points in a few days is significant.

Her skeletal remains provided scientists with invaluable information regarding the human race and its evolution, and Google is celebrating this day with a Doodle. Lucy Australopithecus has been proven to have lived around 3.2 million years ago in Ehtiopia. The Google Doodle dedicated to her today shows three stages of Lucy's evolution. Currently, Lucy's bones are kept in a museum in Ethiopia. Here's more about our ancestor Lucy: 1) 'Lucy' was the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton ever found. Australopithecus afarensis is a species that shares both human and ape characteristics that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. Around 40 per cent of Lucy's remains were discovered intact. 2) Do you know who named her Lucy? Paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson named the fossils Lucy after the Beatles song ' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.' 3) Lucy is a crucial stepping stone between apes and Homo Sapiens. It was exactly 41 years ago from today when the oldest known example of a bipedal primate came into the knowledge of humans. 4) Lucy had numerous similarities with chimpanzees.The skeleton revealed that she mostly walked upright. Bipedalism, walking using two rear limbs or legs, is a key distinction between Homo Sapiens and chimpanzees. 5) According to  , with a mixture of ape and human features - including long dangling arms with pelvic, spine, foot, and leg bones suited to walking upright - slender Lucy stood three-and-a-half feet tall. 6) Lucy is determined as a female due to her size. Fossils that were discovered later were larger in size and were identified as males. 7) Lucy was fully grown, for her wisdom teeth were very human-like. They were exposed and had been in use for a while before her death.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://images.catchnews.com/uploads/images/2015/11/24/lucy-skeleton.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy_Skeleton.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104033", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Though inevitable, the demise of Phobos is not imminent.

Lyubov Sobol, a key figure in Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained for 48 hours after a day of interrogation on charges of violent trespassing. The move followed Sobol’s attempt on Monday to enter the Moscow apartment of the alleged operative, whom Navalny had previously duped into describing details of the alleged poisoning.  Sobol has denied the accusations and insisted that she violated no law by ringing the doorbell to the apartment. While Sobol was being questioned, the state Investigative Committee issued a statement accusing her of trespassing — charges her colleagues have rejected. Earlier this week, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he identified as Konstantin Kudryavtsev and described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him with the Soviet-era Novichok agent in August and then tried to cover it up. Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned. In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake.

Police emergency systems across Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as Nashville’s COVID-19 community hotline, remained out of service due to an AT&T central office being affected by the blast. The building contained a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it — but the company has declined to say exactly how many people have been impacted. AT&T said restoration efforts are facing several challenges, which include a fire that “reignited overnight and led to the evacuation of the building.” This has forced their teams to work with safety and structural engineers and drilling access holes into the building in order to reconnect power. “Our teams continue to work around the clock on recovery efforts from yesterday morning’s explosion in Nashville,” the company said in a Saturday statement. “We have two portable cell sites operating in downtown Nashville with numerous additional portable sites being deployed in the Nashville area and in the region.” Gov. Bill Lee asked the White House on Saturday for federal assistance due to the “severity and magnitude” of the explosion’s impact. At least 41 buildings were damaged, and communications systems — including residential and cell phone service and 911 call centers — failed across the state, he said. Kentucky and northern Alabama were also affected, he said. The outages had even briefly grounded flights at the Nashville International Airport, but service was continuing normally as of Saturday. According to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake, police officers responded on Friday to a report of shots fired when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward. Law enforcement officials have said they believe the blast was intentional but don’t yet know a motive or target. “This morning I toured the site of the bombing,” Gov. Bill Lee tweeted Saturday. “The damage is shocking and it is a miracle that no residents were killed. (First lady Maria) and I continue to pray for those who sustained injuries from the blast.” Lee had been in quarantine due to his wife contracting COVID-19. However, the Republican said that he and Maria had both tested negative, allowing the two to visit downtown Nashville. Lee said the first lady had “fully recovered.” On Friday, Drake told reporters that investigators at the scene “have found tissue that we believe could be remains, but we’ll have that examined and let you know at that time.” No new information regarding the tissue was made available Saturday. Three people taken to area hospitals for treatment were in stable condition Friday evening. The FBI has taken the lead in the investigation, agency spokesman Joel Siskovic said. Federal investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also involved in the investigation. The FBI is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for investigating federal crimes, such as explosives violations and acts of terrorism. Mayor John Cooper has enforced a curfew in the downtown area — which includes the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene, an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops — until Sunday. The curfew was implemented via executive order to limit public access to the area as investigators continue to canvass the scene.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104033", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.mydigitalfc.com", "section": "Just In", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.mydigitalfc.com/companies/251219/nclat-dismisses-it-dept-plea-against-reliance-jio-on-demerger-of-tower.html", "title": "NCLAT dismisses IT dept plea against Reliance Jio on demerger of tower", "author": "\n                ", "author_link": "", "published_date": "\n                ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm.", "text": "The NCLAT has dismissed petitions filed by the Income Tax Department, which raised objection over the approval granted to Reliance Jio Infocomm scheme to hive off its fiber and tower business into two separate units. The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104032", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the question that many people are asking… while several sectors including automobile, real estate, financial services - non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in particular, and manufacturing have shown signs of impact from this economic slowdown. The start-up ecosystem seems to be holding up the jury is still out on this as these are still early days. In the last few years several start-ups have raised millions. While the valuations game is still not fully understood,and funding continues to be a double-edged sword. While funding is crucial for all types of companies, a well-funded company can create immense value and disrupt markets, mismanagement of funds or over funding can be a recipe for disaster. The Indian start-up environment is highly unforgiving. Failures are not celebrated but looked down on so a failed enterprise entrepreneur will find it difficult to regain investor confidence. Entrepreneurs sometimes lack the understanding as to if he needs to expose himself to fresh funding and what needs to be done. There is a need for start-ups to get access to a good mentor or advisor. Operating in this very environment is what Radar India Advisors does. Radar India Advisors was founded with the objective to be an advisor to these start-ups and also help them with access to funds. Set up in 2017, Radar India Advisors is an entrepreneur led outfit built to empower and engage entrepreneurs in their various stages of growth. The management of Radar has built and exited 3 different businesses themselves which helps the sensitise first time and even veteran entrepreneurs. In the last 2 years, the investments in start-ups advised by Radar has grown 10 times. Some of the start-ups managed by Radar include Smartivity, Avishkar Box, Coffee bond, Clevergene Biocorp and Pikapika. In the case of Smartivity and Avishkar Box, has worked closely right from the seed stage funding. Radar facilitated an early stage investment of Rs 60 lakhs from S Chand group into Smartivity. Today, Smartivity has raised a total of 22 crores is currently valued at 100 cr that’s a jump in valuation from 2 cr to 100 cr in 4 years. The revenues of Smartivity stand at Rs 20 cr. Similarly, Radar India Advisors was instrumental in facilitating a Pre-Series A funding of Rs 5 crore into Avishkar Box from Auxano Trust, their revenues stand at 18crore a jump of 800% from the initial 2cr. They are currently valued at 100cr. In the case of Coffee Bond, Radar facilitated a “Pre Series A” funding of Rs 1.5 crore from Auxano Trust in January 2019- revenue jump from Rs 80 Lakhs annually to Rs 3.23 crores in one year and their footprint has grown from one cafe outlet to 13 outlets of sale.  Clevergene Biocorp another company advised by Radar is in the process of closing a Pre-Series A funding from Auxano Trust and has seen a revenue jump from 2 crore to 6 crore(expected for FY 2019-20). PikaPika a kids app to censor content on phone for kids is another client for whom Radar has raised Rs 1 crore from Auxano trust in October and they have seen a big spike in users.  Speaking on the success that Radar has had so far Rahul Gupta CEO, Radar India Advisors Said, “It is important that when working with any start-up, it is critical that we understand what to look for I believe there are six main points that we need to look at, number one is to look for the right fight entrepreneur in diverse industries. People who understand their business and the environment they operate in. Number two is to build a personal touch with the entrepreneurs. Number three is to put your money where your mouth is or to invest into the client yourself. Number four is to look for businesses who are solution providers and not valuation hunters. And finally, we try and give PE level advisory to startups. In terms of investors we work with a host of family offices as well as big business houses like S Chand and Auxano trust, here the key is to Giving investors a sector agnostic approach and a wide range of businesses to invest in.” Radar India Advisors has been steadily adding to its portfolio and is currently advising the Made Easy group on strategy and investment in start-ups.

However, the experienced coach Manolo Marquez Roca feels the result will not affect their morale going into their next match against Kerala Blasters. Speaking on the eve of their ISL clash against strugglers Kerala, who are placed at ninth without a win yet, the Spaniard felt Mumbai City FC were a strong team and they were good on the day. “In football, there are three possibilities: win, draw or loss. It is impossible to maintain only one. After losing one game, no team becomes bad. I think the loss against Mumbai does not affect our team for tomorrow’s game. We will go out to play a good game and win tomorrow,” he said. On being asked about the loss against strong opponents Mumbai and not converting the chances, he said, “I don’t think we created too many chances. I only remember one clear chance from (Mohammad) Yasir one minute before the half time. With the equaliser, the second half would have been different. But with a young and inexperienced side, I am happy with the way they played in the second half.” Speaking about their opponents Kerala Blasters, he rated the team very high on talent. “For me it is a very good team. They played an open game in the championship against ATK and they didn’t deserve to lose. In the last game, they equalised in injury time. They have got good players and they deserve more points than what they have now. For sure it will be a tough battle,” he added. When asked about major changes in the upcoming game, he said he does not believe in changing the team because of one loss. “There are a few areas from the Mumbai game where we can improve and change some players maybe. We are not going to make too many tactical changes and we played six games and had only one loss. Can’t change too many things.” He said talented Indian player Nikhil Poojary will be out of this game owing to injuries. “You don’t win games on revealing who is playing or not. For me, the squad is of 29 players and 28 players were training and only one player was out with injury. All other players are in the contention for a place. Only Nikhil is not in the reckoning because of injury,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

The moment Siraj took to the field with his teammates, his mother Shabana Begum’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. Speaking after watching his son don Indian colours, she said her husband’s (Mohammed Ghouse) dream finally fulfilled. “  (It is all the grace of Almighty). Thanks to God, his father would be proud of him today,” she said. When asked about their feeling ahead of his debut, she said, “We got up very early to watch him play. We were excited and happy. But when he took the field and stood there with his teammates singing the national anthem, it brought us tears.” Siraj had a wonderful debut picking up two crucial wickets that helped India skittle out Australia for 195 runs on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. When asked about their feeling after Siraj picked up his first wicket, Shabana said, “We can’t express the feeling. Playing for country has always been his and his father’s dream. Now he made the country proud.” Shabana, who was worried for Siraj for neglecting his studies and focusing on cricket, added she wants her son to win matches for India. Siraj’s grandmother Sardar Bhi said that the family was delighted. “Due to his father’s death, the family mourning will continue for three months. So we told Siraj’s friends not to come to the house for watching the match. We know they are all excited to share their joy with us. But this is a tough time.” “We started getting calls early in the morning when he took those two wickets. We switched off our mobiles and kept it aside to watch the match,” she added. Siraj’s brother Mohammed Ismail said he was over the moon. “I wasn’t feeling well in the morning, so I watched till lunch and slept off. But I have been receiving calls from people congratulating us. It is a great moment for our family,” he added. A long time friend of Siraj, Mohd Shafi said that he is poised for greater things. “I am very happy to see Siraj playing for the country. If his father was here, he would have been very happy. I spoke to his mother, she was also very happy. I spoke to Siraj as well after the first day’s game. He said if people support him, he would do many great things for the country.

The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily. Medical devices makers' body, AdvaMed Vice President Abby Pratt said it would urge the government to promote the adoption of global harmonisation, including internationally recognised standards, that would not only help ensure the quality and efficacy of products but also enable an ecosystem for manufacturing, research, and innovation for benefits of patients in India.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104035", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Silica makes up nine-tenths of the composition of some of the rocks. The University of Copenhagen's Jens Frydenvang said that the high silica was a surprise, adding that while they are still working with multiple hypotheses on how the silica got so enriched, these hypotheses all require considerable water activity, and on Earth high silica deposits are often associated with environments that provide excellent support for microbial life. Because of this, the science team agreed to make a rare backtrack to investigate it more. Curiosity's science team is working with two main hypotheses to explain the recent findings on Mount Sharp, both of which require water. Water that is acidic would tend to carry other ingredients away and leave silica behind. Alkaline or neutral water could bring in dissolved silica that would be deposited from the solution. Apart from presenting a puzzle about the history of the region where Curiosity is working, the recent findings on Mount Sharp have intriguing threads to what an earlier rover, Spirit, found halfway around Mars. There, signs of sulfuric acidity were observed. Adding to the puzzle, some of the silica found at one rock Curiosity drilled, called \"Buckskin,\" is in a mineral named tridymite, which is found in Bandelier tuff, common in New Mexico but rare elsewhere, and never before seen on Mars. The usual origin of tridymite on Earth involves high temperatures in igneous or metamorphic rocks, but the finely layered sedimentary rocks examined by Curiosity have been interpreted as lakebed deposits.

It is still unclear why there's no doodle for India. Google, you may want to comment on this... The solstice is commonly used to refer to the longest or shortest day of the year. Though it's more accurately described by its astronomical definition. In technical terms, the Solstice occurs when, due to the rotation of the Earth around the Sun, the North Pole is tilted furthest away from the Sun. The Independent explains, \"For those in the Northern Hemisphere, that means less of the Earth's area is covered by the Sun during the day, and when the solstice comes around, the day becomes the shortest of the year.\" Usually, the Winter Solstice falls on 21st December every year, but this year it's on the 22nd, and yes there's a reason too.

Lyubov Sobol, a key figure in Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained for 48 hours after a day of interrogation on charges of violent trespassing. The move followed Sobol’s attempt on Monday to enter the Moscow apartment of the alleged operative, whom Navalny had previously duped into describing details of the alleged poisoning.  Sobol has denied the accusations and insisted that she violated no law by ringing the doorbell to the apartment. While Sobol was being questioned, the state Investigative Committee issued a statement accusing her of trespassing — charges her colleagues have rejected. Earlier this week, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he identified as Konstantin Kudryavtsev and described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him with the Soviet-era Novichok agent in August and then tried to cover it up. Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned. In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake.

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route. A clarification on the non-applicability of the new FDI measure would be critical for them to continue making massive investments in India,\" it added.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104036", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) told CBS News that requesting the data was regular procedure for police forces in the U.K. \n  \n  \n\n \n The NPCC spokesman said the new form was designed to provide \"consistency across the board, so nationally there was a standardized version for forces to offer the same service.\" Police can collect personal data to investigate a variety of crimes and what they try to obtain ranges from case to case, but often includes medical, education and psychiatric records, as well as cell phone and smartwatch data. Critics of the practice say the consent form poses serious risks, especially in cases of sexual assault. \"The issue I'm hearing from victims is that if they didn't want to share this information — and often they didn't, they didn't feel it was reasonable or proportionate to their complaint of rape — they were told the police might be unable to continue with the investigation and the Crown Prosecution Service wouldn't be able to consider a charge or look at prosecuting the accused without looking at the material,\" Claire Waxman, Victims' Commissioner for London, said. \"It was putting victims into a very difficult situation where they almost had to choose between do I want to access justice or is my right to privacy more important?\" \n     The NPCC disputed this claim, and said the police don't collect or seek personal data from all accusers, only when it is believed it will help bring a case forward. The Council also noted that the same personal data may also be taken from the accused. Kate Ellis, a lawyer at the Centre for Women's Justice, told CBS News that the breadth of the personal data requested is unacceptable. \"There is no problem at all with an officer asking a complainant, 'look, you mentioned that you had text messages with the suspect, can we see those text messages? We're going to need to keep them.' A complainant telling the truth would have nothing to hide. But what's being done is a completely disproportionate measure, which is asking complainants to agree to everything that's on their mobile phone and evidence around their historical relationships with people, so that police can examine it and see if there's anything that might impute their credibility,\" she said. Waxman, who works for the London government, noted that in recent years she's seen sexual assault victims feel re-traumatized and shocked by having to give away their personal data. \"They thought they were being investigated and they thought that was incredibly unfair,\" she said.  Waxman has also asked the U.K national government's Information Commissioner's Office to look into whether the practice is compliant with recently adopted General Data Protection Regulations ( ) within the European Union. Though the commission has not made its final report public, the NPCC chose to release its updated version of the consent form as a new guideline. \"We are asking for your consent, and that meets GDPR,\" the NCPP spokesman told CBS News. \"You can revoke that consent.\" \n     The police spokesman told CBS News that the consent form could be changed if the ICO recommends tweaks. But critics are more concerned about the implications of the existing practice than possible changes to the new consent form. Waxman and Ellis voiced concerns that victims would be discouraged from reporting sexual assault and rape, at a time when police   have dropped 9.1 percent.   \"They are putting rape complainants, having been through something that is very traumatic, that they are going to be told they either have to hand over their entire private life, or they are not going to get justice,\" Ellis said. \"That's very problematic because the reality is that the majority of rapists get away with it.\" Ellis is considering legal action to try to end the practice on behalf of her clients at the Centre for Women's Justice. The NPCC stands by its guidelines, which it insists are intended to help carry out justice. \"We don't want to discourage (crime) reporting,\" the spokesman said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg#\" alt=\"George Blake Holding Coat \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/1280x720/a959f53d248f6fb7dc4ddfff51e2e2b3/blake.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104035", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, has declared himself interim president of Venezuela and has been recognized as the country's rightful leader by the U.S. and over 50 other countries. \n  \n  \n\n \n Guaidó announced Tuesday morning that key factions of the military were supporting his leadership instead of that of President Nicolas Maduro, and called on Venezuelans to take to the streets to show their opposition to the Maduro regime. Guaidó said that this effort, which he calls \"Operacion Libertad\" -- Operation Liberty -- would be the \"final phase\" of the plan to oust Maduro. Mr. Trump   that he was \"monitoring\" the situation. \"I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!\" Mr. Trump wrote. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in an interview that Maduro had a plane idling on the tarmac to leave Venezuela, but Russians indicated to Maduro that he should stay. Pompeo said that Maduro was headed to Havana, Cuba, and that it is \"a fact\" that Maduro was prepping to depart -- but he did not explain how the U.S. obtained this information. \n     \"It's time for him to leave Venezuela,\" Pompeo said, adding that his advice to Maduro was to \"fire up the plane.\" Vice President Mike Pence   that the U.S. will stand with Venezuela \"until freedom & democracy are restored.\" \"To @jguaido, the National Assembly and all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela who are taking to the streets today in #operacionlibertad-Estamos con ustedes! We are with you! America will stand with you until freedom & democracy are restored. Vayan con dios! #FreeVenezuela,\" Pence wrote on the official Twitter account for the vice president. Pompeo also wrote that \"the U.S. Government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy\"   Tuesday morning. National Security Adviser Bolton responded to Vladimir Padrino, the defense minister of Venezuela, who asserted on Tuesday that Maduro's administration \"reject[s] this coup movement\" by Guaidó and his supporters. \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,\" Bolton said   which tagged Padrino. He later sent another tweet tagging Padrino, Chief Judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Court Maikel Moreno, the commander of the presidential guard Rafael Hernandez-Dala, saying that \"your time is up.\" \"This is your last chance. Accept Interim President Guaido's amnesty, protect the Constitution, and remove Maduro, and we will take you off our sanctions list. Stay with Maduro, and go down with the ship,\" Bolton wrote. Bolton later told reporters that the U.S. would consider intervening in Venezuela. \n     \"We want, as our principal objective, the peaceful transition of power, but I will say again as the president has said from the outset and as Nicolas Maduro and those supporting him -- particularly those who are not Venezuelan -- should know, is all options are on the table,\" Bolton said. \n\n           Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special representative for Venezuela, was more measured in his reaction to the uprising. He said that the situation on the ground remains \"confused\" and he didn't know why the timeline for protests expected for Wednesday got moved to Tuesday. He also said that he wasn't aware of any timeline for negotiations with officials in the Maduro government, referring to Bolton's tweet. These negotiations have been going on among Venezuelans, and not with the U.S., for a \"long time.\" \"I do not recall there being any time limit when the negotiations…were under way,\" Abrams said. Abrams said he texted with Guaidó Tuesday and found him \"buoyant and determined.\" White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney also seemed to tamp down expectations of American intervention in Venezuela Tuesday. \"We are watching it with everyone else,\" Mulvaney said in an interview at the Milken Institute. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, told reporters Tuesday morning that \"Maduro has got to go.\" \n     \"This will finally get the Venezuelan people the freedom that they need,\" Conway said, adding that millions of Venezuelans have fled to Colombia and Brazil to escape the ongoing conflict. \"I'm sure they would prefer to be in their home country, but they simply cant stay there and be expected to survive or thrive.\" Conway said that the administration was \"monitoring\" Guaidó's actions in Venezuela, and that the U.S. wants a \"peaceful transition.\" Some members of Congress have also shown support for Guaidó on Tuesday. Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that he did not see the uprising as a \"coup,\" but \"as an effort to restore democracy.\" He also said that he was willing to consider military intervention. \"If they move on Guaidó and his elements, then, we're trying to restore democracy,\" Graham said. Rep.

Top U.S. officials, including  , were quick to vouch their support for Guaidó's bid to oust Maduro. \n\n    \n           Venezuela's socialist government, meanwhile, called the move by the opposition leader a \"coup\" sponsored by the U.S., with one of its most highest-ranking officials and speaker of the pro-Maduro legislature, Diosdado Cabello, urging supporters to come out and defend the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas. \n  \n  \n\n \n Clashes in the capital and other parts of the country  ensued between civilians and soldiers supportive of Guaidó and Maduro's security forces and pro-government militias, known as \"colectivos.\" Roberto Ampuero, Chile's Minister of Foreign Affairs, said the Chilean embassy in Caracas was hosting Lopez and his family as \"guests.\" The bold action by the opposition could allow the international community and people of Venezuela to gauge whether Guaidó can accomplish what has so far proved elusive: mustering enough support among the nation's sprawling military structure to force Maduro to relinquish power. On Tuesday night, in his first public appearance since Guaidó announced the \"final phase\" of his bid to take power, Maduro said his government had defeated the \"small\" uprising, which he denounced as a coup attempt organized by fascists and U.S. lackeys. He said the attorney general had designated three special prosecutors to investigate the uprising and interrogate those involved. In first public appearance, Maduro proclaims \"defeat\" of uprising On Tuesday night, in his first public appearance since Guaidó announced the \"final phase\" of his bid to take power, Maduro said his government had defeated the \"small\" uprising, which he denounced as a coup attempt organized by Venezuela 's far-right and U.S. lackeys.  \n     In a televised speech alongside top government officials and military leaders, Maduro said the attorney general had designated three special prosecutors to investigate the uprising and interrogate those involved, who he accused of wanting to provoke a \"massacre\"  \"The traitors will soon see what their fate is,\" Maduro said. ​Lawmaker urges Trump to take whatever action necessary to stop \"evil\" in Venezuela A Republican lawmaker urged President Trump to be \"firm\" and take whatever action may be necessary to stop \"evil\" in Venezuela. \"I obviously urge the administration to continue to be firm and to take whatever further action may be necessary to make sure that, frankly, evil does not prevail in Venezuela and in this hemisphere,\" Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida told CBS News Tuesday afternoon. Díaz-Balart called Maduro's increasingly authoritarian regime, which a coalition of Western countries have urged to hold  , a \"great threat\" to American national security, alongside other leftist governments in Latin America. \"What is happening in this hemisphere -- with Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua -- is, I think, more dangerous to the national security interest of the United States than a lot of the things that are taking place in the Middle East,\" he added. Pompeo: Maduro was \"ready to leave\" Venezuela Pompeo said Maduro prepared to flee Venezuela Tuesday morning, but backed off the move because of advise from the Russia government. \n     \"He had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning, as we understand it. And the Russians indicated he should stay,\" Pompeo said during an appearance on CNN late Tuesday afternoon. \"He was headed for Havana,\" the secretary of state added, referring to the Cuban capital. Pressed for evidence, Pompeo said his claim was based on \"conversations.\" Doctors treat 50 injured in skirmishes The director of a medical center in Venezuela's capital said doctors are treating 50 patients injured during street skirmishes. Thirty of the injured were shot with rubber bullets, according to Salud Chacao director Maggia Santi. Another 16 sustained bodily trauma, while three reported difficulty breathing and one was shot with a firearm. She said doctors have sufficient supplies to treat the injured, in part due to recent donations by organizations including the Red Cross. Brazil sees point of no return in Venezuela Brazil's vice president said the situation in Venezuela has reached a point of no return. Former Gen. Hamilton Mourão said Tuesday that either opposition leaders Guaidó and Leopoldo López would \"be prisoners\" or  Maduro \"would be leaving.\" \n     \"There is no other way out of this,\" Mourão said. Brazil borders Venezuela to the south and recognizes Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate president. Bolton: \"All options are on the table\" President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said Tuesday that Mr. Trump wants to see a peaceful transfer of power in Venezuela -- a possibility he said \"still exists.\" He also said \"all options are on the table.\" Speaking to reporters at the White House Tuesday afternoon, Bolton said what is happening in Venezuela \"is clearly not a coup.\" \"We recognize Juan Guaido as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela, and just as it's not a coup when the President of the United States gives an order to the Department of Defense, it's not a coup for Juan Guaido to try and take command of the Venezuelan military,\" he said. \r\n Bolton also said the U.S. believes Cuba has played \"a very significant role in propping Maduro up today, possibly with help from the Russians. That's the speculation, certainly in Caracas.\" \n     \"The sooner Maduro is gone, the sooner is the possibility of justice and real economic growth for the Venezuelan people,\" he said. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump , \"The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!\" UN chief urges \"maximum restraint\" The U.N. says Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging all sides in Venezuela to exercise \"maximum restraint,\" avoid any violence and take immediate steps to restore calm. Guterres' \"message publicly and privately has been to push for dialogue in order to resolve this peacefully,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Tuesday. Dujarric said the U.N. is \"reaching out to both sides.\" He noted that Guterres met Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza last week and met Monday with the Lima group of countries supporting Guaidó. Dujarric also said the U.N. is taking measures to ensure the safety of its staff in the country. Street clashes erupt \n\n           Anti-government demonstrators clashed with troops loyal to Maduro at an air base in Caracas, the country's capital, hours after Guaidó's attempt to lead a military uprising. Video showed unrest, including clashes, as well as an armored military vehicle ramming into pro-Guaidó protesters in the city. \r\n Internet restrictions reported in Venezuela Venezuela's state run internet provider has been restricting access to YouTube and Google services following the opposition leader's call for the military to revolt against Maduro, a group that monitors internet censorship said. \n     The non-governmental NetBlocks group said access to the services remains intermittently available since the restrictions don't appear to be completely effective. It said Twitter, Facebook and several other services were briefly restricted earlier, although core internet connectivity remains unaffected. The group said past incidents of network filtering in Venezuela have lasted from 12 minutes to over 20 hours. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Defense minister rejects attempt by \"subversive movement\" The events appear not to have triggered a broader military revolt. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino on Twitter rejected what he called an attempt by a \"subversive movement\" to generate \"panic and terror.\" The ruling socialist party chief, Diosdado Cabello, said most of Caracas was calm and called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend Maduro from what he said was a U.S.-backed coup attempt. About a dozen government supporters, some of them brandishing firearms, gathered at the presidential palace, answered the call. \"It's time to defend the revolution with arms,\" Valentin Santana, head of a militant group, said in a video posted on social media as he brandished an automatic rifle. Meanwhile, Guaidó said he would release a list of top commanders supporting the uprising in the coming hours. \n     Putin discusses uprising with his top security body Russian President Vladimir Putin has discussed the ongoing uprising in Venezuela with his top security body. Putin raised the current developments in Venezuela during his scheduled meeting with the Security Council, Russian news agencies quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. Peskov said that the meeting \"paid significant attention to the news reports about a coup attempt in that country.\" He did not elaborate further. Pence: \"We are with you!\" U.S. Vice President Mike Pence tweeted \"We are with you!\" Tuesday to the Venezuelans taking to the streets after Guaidó's call for an uprising. \"America will stand with you until freedom & democracy are restored,\" he added. The U.S. and dozens of other countries have recognized Guaidó as Venezuela's rightful leader, arguing that Maduro's re-  was invalid. \r\n The White House later said it is \"watching and waiting\" on the situation in Venezuela and hoping the result is democracy. It was unclear how much advance knowledge the Trump administration had of Guaido's plans for Tuesday, but President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton was first to tweet his support. \n     \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,\" Bolton ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/ccd4efe4-d518-469d-8a0c-5dc465e88dcf/thumbnail/620x413/4afafdcf4d94fb5a9c0a2efb266a1a83/ap-19120582736136.jpg#\" alt=\"ap-19120582736136.jpg \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/ccd4efe4-d518-469d-8a0c-5dc465e88dcf/thumbnail/620x413/4afafdcf4d94fb5a9c0a2efb266a1a83/ap-19120582736136.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/ccd4efe4-d518-469d-8a0c-5dc465e88dcf/thumbnail/1240x826/c0161f137b027630a63240baeb72de7f/ap-19120582736136.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104037", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "telugu.samayam.com", "section": "48238599.cms", "sub_section": "Telugu News", "article_url": "https://telugu.samayam.com/education/study-tips/what-to-do-after-inter-list-of-top-professional-courses-after-12th-and-intermediate/articleshow/79940080.cms", "title": "ఇంటర్‌ తర్వాత బాగా డిమాండ్‌ ఉన్న కోర్సులివే..!

I look back now and wonder: How can we return to a place with more opportunities that lead to a better quality of life for all? I believe the answer is through a more progressive form of capitalism. Along my journey of upward mobility, I married into an immigrant family. I've observed that my relatives in Europe enjoy a similar pathway to the American dream that I grew up chasing. Like   in many parts of 1970s America we had a better funded  system, affordable colleges with generous  , solid   and  . If we can recapture some of what we've lost from that era, make it more inclusive and add in subsidized child care, along with paid sick and parental leave, then we can build a 21st-century foundation for US capitalism that many working-class Americans long for. We could have a baseline social welfare infrastructure that would allow vastly more Americans the opportunity to reach their full potential.

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104037", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the recent passing away of Siraj’s father, the celebrations were muted and confined to indoors. But the family members of the fast bowler, who made his Test debut against Australia on Saturday, were excited while they followed the game on the television. The moment Siraj took to the field with his teammates, his mother Shabana Begum’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. Speaking after watching his son don Indian colours, she said her husband’s (Mohammed Ghouse) dream finally fulfilled. “  (It is all the grace of Almighty). Thanks to God, his father would be proud of him today,” she said. When asked about their feeling ahead of his debut, she said, “We got up very early to watch him play. We were excited and happy. But when he took the field and stood there with his teammates singing the national anthem, it brought us tears.” Siraj had a wonderful debut picking up two crucial wickets that helped India skittle out Australia for 195 runs on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. When asked about their feeling after Siraj picked up his first wicket, Shabana said, “We can’t express the feeling. Playing for country has always been his and his father’s dream. Now he made the country proud.” Shabana, who was worried for Siraj for neglecting his studies and focusing on cricket, added she wants her son to win matches for India. Siraj’s grandmother Sardar Bhi said that the family was delighted. “Due to his father’s death, the family mourning will continue for three months. So we told Siraj’s friends not to come to the house for watching the match. We know they are all excited to share their joy with us. But this is a tough time.” “We started getting calls early in the morning when he took those two wickets. We switched off our mobiles and kept it aside to watch the match,” she added. Siraj’s brother Mohammed Ismail said he was over the moon. “I wasn’t feeling well in the morning, so I watched till lunch and slept off. But I have been receiving calls from people congratulating us. It is a great moment for our family,” he added. A long time friend of Siraj, Mohd Shafi said that he is poised for greater things. “I am very happy to see Siraj playing for the country. If his father was here, he would have been very happy. I spoke to his mother, she was also very happy. I spoke to Siraj as well after the first day’s game. He said if people support him, he would do many great things for the country.

While the valuations game is still not fully understood,and funding continues to be a double-edged sword. While funding is crucial for all types of companies, a well-funded company can create immense value and disrupt markets, mismanagement of funds or over funding can be a recipe for disaster. The Indian start-up environment is highly unforgiving. Failures are not celebrated but looked down on so a failed enterprise entrepreneur will find it difficult to regain investor confidence. Entrepreneurs sometimes lack the understanding as to if he needs to expose himself to fresh funding and what needs to be done. There is a need for start-ups to get access to a good mentor or advisor.

People who understand their business and the environment they operate in. Number two is to build a personal touch with the entrepreneurs. Number three is to put your money where your mouth is or to invest into the client yourself. Number four is to look for businesses who are solution providers and not valuation hunters.

Each of these presents its own set of challenges for American democracy. If Trump ekes out a victory in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote, Americans on the left will inevitably raise concerns about minoritarian rule. A Republican presidential candidate has captured the popular vote only once since 1992, and yet another victory that fails to capture the popular vote will convince many Americans that the Electoral College is unfairly stacked against Democratic voters who tend to cluster in large cities in blue states.   If Trump   by up to 5 million votes in the popular vote, as he could well do, and he remains in office thanks to an Electoral College victory after a divisive first term, it would vindicate his strategy of catering to a fervent white, rural and older base of voters while spurning a more multi-cultural and eclectic American majority. The American left would view such a narrow victory as the product of political manipulation, especially after Republicans over the last two decades   hardball on gerrymandering and   voting laws. But if history is any indication Democrats are unlikely to do more than loudly complain unless there is evidence that Trump engaged in actual electoral tampering to ensure his victory. A Biden landslide in both the popular vote and the electoral college, which seems plausible given current polling, would raise its own set of challenges. It is hard to imagine Trump accepting a loss with grace and giving a magnanimous concession speech wishing Biden and the country well. The best-case scenario under this potential outcome is that Trump grumbles on his way out, ready to   his business empire and perhaps start Trump TV while a number of lawsuits and investigations play out.

The next wave of growth could come from increasing exports to large and traditionally under penetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Latin America, which would help the industry meet its aspiration of becoming the world's largest supplier by volume, according to pharma industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). Experts said improved access to medicines in India and exploring new markets while maintaining thrust in the US will help the country's pharma industry to record double-digit growth in the coming year. However, the sector, specially pharmaceuticals, will be up against headwinds of increased costs related to regulatory compliances, particularly for the US market, price controls across markets and mandatory genericisation in India. \"The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is a sunrise industry with a competitive advantage for India. We should leverage India's position by unleashing entrepreneurial spirit through policy stability and ecosystem,\" IPA Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said. The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily. Medical devices makers' body, AdvaMed Vice President Abby Pratt said it would urge the government to promote the adoption of global harmonisation, including internationally recognised standards, that would not only help ensure the quality and efficacy of products but also enable an ecosystem for manufacturing, research, and innovation for benefits of patients in India.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104038", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Expected better from you guys,\" said another comment. Several Twitter observers asked why there was only one footprint when the beast would probably have had two feet. One Twitter user took the opportunity to jab the Indian Army over another dubious claim, about a much more serious topic. In February, amid soaring tension with neighbor Pakistan, India's military claimed to have carried out an airstrike on Pakistani territory that it said had destroyed a terrorist training camp in the Balakot area. However Pakistan insisted the missiles had fallen into an empty forest hillside in the Himalayas, and there was never any evidence the strike had destroyed anything but trees. \"Foot-print suggests that this Yeti is one-legged. Looks like he lost his other leg in Balakote air strike,\" mocked a Twitter user Shah Faesal. \n Others, were more forgiving, though still tongue-in-cheek. \"Congratulations, we are always proud of you. salutes to the #IndianArmy Mountaineering Expedition Team,\" wrote Tarun Vijay, a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. But Vijay said the snowman should not be referred to as \"a beast.\" \n     The army said the footprints measured 32 inches by 15 inches (81 centimeters by 38) and were spotted by a team on April 9 close to the Makalu Base Camp, an isolated area on the Nepal-China frontier. An army official told AFP that pictures were released to \"excite a bit of a scientific temper.\" \"We will share whatever we get with the domain experts to analyse. We will be contacting the team on the satphone in the evening for more details about it. The idea is to find out more, to look for an answer,\" the official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. The yeti is traditionally described as an ape-like creature, taller than a human, that lives in the Himalayas, Siberia, and parts of Central and East Asia. Most scientists have written the creature off as a centuries-old myth originating in Tibet.

Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, has declared himself interim president of Venezuela and has been recognized as the country's rightful leader by the U.S. and over 50 other countries. \n  \n  \n\n \n Guaidó announced Tuesday morning that key factions of the military were supporting his leadership instead of that of President Nicolas Maduro, and called on Venezuelans to take to the streets to show their opposition to the Maduro regime. Guaidó said that this effort, which he calls \"Operacion Libertad\" -- Operation Liberty -- would be the \"final phase\" of the plan to oust Maduro. Mr. Trump   that he was \"monitoring\" the situation. \"I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!\" Mr. Trump wrote. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in an interview that Maduro had a plane idling on the tarmac to leave Venezuela, but Russians indicated to Maduro that he should stay. Pompeo said that Maduro was headed to Havana, Cuba, and that it is \"a fact\" that Maduro was prepping to depart -- but he did not explain how the U.S. obtained this information. \n     \"It's time for him to leave Venezuela,\" Pompeo said, adding that his advice to Maduro was to \"fire up the plane.\" Vice President Mike Pence   that the U.S. will stand with Venezuela \"until freedom & democracy are restored.\" \"To @jguaido, the National Assembly and all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela who are taking to the streets today in #operacionlibertad-Estamos con ustedes!

Pompeo also wrote that \"the U.S. Government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy\"   Tuesday morning. National Security Adviser Bolton responded to Vladimir Padrino, the defense minister of Venezuela, who asserted on Tuesday that Maduro's administration \"reject[s] this coup movement\" by Guaidó and his supporters. \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,\" Bolton said   which tagged Padrino. He later sent another tweet tagging Padrino, Chief Judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Court Maikel Moreno, the commander of the presidential guard Rafael Hernandez-Dala, saying that \"your time is up.\" \"This is your last chance. Accept Interim President Guaido's amnesty, protect the Constitution, and remove Maduro, and we will take you off our sanctions list. Stay with Maduro, and go down with the ship,\" Bolton wrote. Bolton later told reporters that the U.S. would consider intervening in Venezuela. \n     \"We want, as our principal objective, the peaceful transition of power, but I will say again as the president has said from the outset and as Nicolas Maduro and those supporting him -- particularly those who are not Venezuelan -- should know, is all options are on the table,\" Bolton said. \n\n           Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special representative for Venezuela, was more measured in his reaction to the uprising. He said that the situation on the ground remains \"confused\" and he didn't know why the timeline for protests expected for Wednesday got moved to Tuesday. He also said that he wasn't aware of any timeline for negotiations with officials in the Maduro government, referring to Bolton's tweet. These negotiations have been going on among Venezuelans, and not with the U.S., for a \"long time.\" \"I do not recall there being any time limit when the negotiations…were under way,\" Abrams said. Abrams said he texted with Guaidó Tuesday and found him \"buoyant and determined.\" White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney also seemed to tamp down expectations of American intervention in Venezuela Tuesday. \"We are watching it with everyone else,\" Mulvaney said in an interview at the Milken Institute. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, told reporters Tuesday morning that \"Maduro has got to go.\" \n     \"This will finally get the Venezuelan people the freedom that they need,\" Conway said, adding that millions of Venezuelans have fled to Colombia and Brazil to escape the ongoing conflict. \"I'm sure they would prefer to be in their home country, but they simply cant stay there and be expected to survive or thrive.\" Conway said that the administration was \"monitoring\" Guaidó's actions in Venezuela, and that the U.S. wants a \"peaceful transition.\" Some members of Congress have also shown support for Guaidó on Tuesday. Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that he did not see the uprising as a \"coup,\" but \"as an effort to restore democracy.\" He also said that he was willing to consider military intervention. \"If they move on Guaidó and his elements, then, we're trying to restore democracy,\" Graham said. Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, Republican from Florida, said that he urged the administration to be \"firm\" with with regards to policy in Venezuela. \"I obviously urge the administration to continue to be firm and to take whatever further action may be necessary to make sure that, frankly, evil does not prevail in Venezuela and in this hemisphere,\" Díaz-Balart of Florida told CBS News Tuesday afternoon. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/80x80/7d80df8dba322d5cc9233d11e188bbd1/grace-headshot.jpg#\" alt=\"grace-headshot.jpg \" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/80x80/7d80df8dba322d5cc9233d11e188bbd1/grace-headshot.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/160x160/b4361737dd147702392a40fb5df9ed9d/grace-headshot.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2080%2080'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104039", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The video shows a detailed specimen of how male-to-female gender reassignment surgery actually works.    The animated video shows a surgeon opening up the scrotum, removing the testicles and lastly, the head of the penis in order to create a clitoris. The shaft and the scrotum are later used to create a labia and the vaginal canal.  However, these are only the surgical changes in the body. People have to go under several hormonal therapies to completely transform in to another gender.  \"On the other hand, recent developments have also happened with female to male surgery, with the first penis transplant in the US slated to happen at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine on a wounded soldier who sustained a genital injury. Sadly, the transplant is only available to men injured in combat and not transgender men\", reports  . \"Dr Jeffrey Kahn, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins, told the New York Times that once these surgeries have proven to be successful, it's very possible it will be made available to transgender men, provided the donors will allow it. \"What do you say to the donor?\" Kahn said. \"A 23-year-old wounded in the line of duty has a very different sound than somebody who is seeking gender reassignment\", adds  .

The announcement of   is a major shift in alliances that came after President Donald Trump   from the northern border area amid the rapidly deepening chaos. The shift sets up a potential clash between Turkey and Syria and raises the specter of a resurgent Islamic State group as the U.S. relinquishes any remaining influence in northern Syria to President Bashar Assad and his chief backer, Russia. On Monday morning, Syria’s state news agency said that the army had moved into the town of Tal Tamr, which is about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Turkish border. SANA said government forces would “confront the Turkish aggression,” without giving further details. Photos posted by SANA showed several vehicles and a small number of troops. Tal Tamr is a predominantly Assyrian Christian town that was once held by IS before it was retaken by Kurdish-led forces. Many Syrian Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million, left for Europe over the past 20 years, with the flight gathering speed since the country’s conflict began in March 2011. SANA did not say from which area the Syrian army had moved into the town. Despite widespread criticism from its NATO allies in Europe and the U.S., Turkey has pressed on with its offensive into northern Syria. Turkish forces appeared set to launch an operation on the town of Manbij farther west on Monday, according to CNN-Turk, which said the forces had reached the city’s edge. \n", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104038", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Pentagon previously had pulled away about 30 troops from the Turkish attack zone along the border. With an escalation of violence, a widening of the Turkish incursion and the prospect of more confusing conflict, all U.S. forces along the border will now follow that move. “We have American forces likely caught between two opposing advancing armies and it’s a very untenable situation,” Esper said. The Pentagon chief, who spoke in two TV interviews, did not say the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria are leaving the country entirely. Trump’s national security team planned to meet later Sunday to assess the situation, Esper said, as U.S. officials continue to urge Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to halt and reverse his incursion. Asked whether he thought Turkey, a NATO ally, would deliberately attack American troops in Syria, Esper said, “I don’t know whether they would or wouldn’t.” He cited an incident on Friday in which a small number of U.S. troops fell under artillery fire at an observation post in the north. Esper called that an example of “indiscriminate fire” coming close to Americans, adding it was unclear whether that was an accident. Esper said he spoke to Trump on Saturday night amid growing signs that the Turkish invasion, which began Wednesday, was growing more dangerous. “In the last 24 hours, we learned that they (the Turks) likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned — and to the west,” Esper said. The U.S. also has come to believe that the Kurds are attempting to “cut a deal” with the Syrian army and Russia to counter the invading Turks, he said. As a result, Trump “directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria,” Esper said. Trump, in a tweet Sunday, said: “Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?” Esper said he would not discuss a timeline for the U.S. pullback, but said it would be done “as safely and quickly as possible.” Esper did not say how many U.S. troops will leave the north, but he says they represent most of the 1,000 troops in Syria. The Americans have been working for five years with a Kurd-led Syrian group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces to combat the Islamic State group. Turkey has long objected to the U.S.-Kurd alliance because Turkey considers elements of that force to be terrorists tied to an insurgency inside Turkey. The Pentagon had said before the operation began that the U.S. military would not support it, and the U.S. pulled about 30 special operations troops out of observation posts along the invasion route on the Syrian border to keep them out of harm’s way. The Turkish offensive initially covered an area along the border about 125 kilometers (77 miles) wide and about 30 kilometers (19 miles) deep. Esper said it has since grown wider and deeper. Esper said he was aware of reports of hundreds of IS prisoners escaping as a result of the Turkish invasion and of atrocities being committed against Syrian Kurds by members of a Turkish-supported Syrian Arab militia. “It gets worse by the hour,” Esper said. “These are all the exact things” that U.S. officials warned Erdogan would likely happen by ignoring U.S. urgings not to invade northern Syria. Esper said there was “no way” U.S. forces could have stopped the Turks, who assembled a force of about 15,000 troops on the Syrian border, supported by air power. “We did not sign up to fight Turkey, a longstanding NATO ally, on behalf of the (Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces). This is a terrible situation,” he said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held out the possibility of quick action to impose economic sanctions on Turkey, a move that Trump has repeatedly threatened if the Turks were to push too far into Syria. “We’ll be taking in new information and we’re ready to go at a moment’s notice to put on sanctions,” Mnuchin said. “Now we have warned the Turks. … They know what we will do if they don’t stop these activities.” Esper appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and “Fox News Sunday.” Mnuchin was interviewed on ABC’s “This Week.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104039", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The first person at the home to be immunized with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 101-year-old Edith Kwoizalla, the DPA news agency reported. Krueger said 40 of the home’s 59 residents wanted the immunization shot along with 10 of around 40 workers. He was among those immunized but added, “I also understand the concerns.” In Hungary, health care workers were vaccinated at the Southern Pest Central Hospital in Budapest, while in Slovakia, the first person to receive a jab was a 60-year-old top expert on infectious diseases, Vladimir Krcmery. He was vaccinated along with doctors at the University Hospital in the city of Nitra, in what Health Minister Marek Krajci called a “historic moment.” The first shipments of the vaccine arrived at hospitals across the EU in super-cold containers late Friday and early Saturday after being sent from a manufacturing center in Belgium before Christmas. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen released a video celebrating the vaccine rollout for the bloc of nearly 450 million people, calling it “a touching moment of unity.” “Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year. The COVID-19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries. Vaccination will begin tomorrow across the EU,” she said. The rollout marks a moment of hope for a region that includes some of the world’s earliest and worst-hit virus hot spots — Italy and Spain — and others like the Czech Republic, which were spared early on only to see their health care systems near their breaking point in the fall. In all, EU nations have recorded at least 16 million coronavirus infections and more than 336,000 deaths — huge numbers that experts agree still understate the true toll of the pandemic due to missed cases and limited testing. Still, the vaccine rollout helps the bloc project a sense of unity in a complex lifesaving mission after it faced a year of difficulties in negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain. It also brings a sigh of relief for EU politicians who were frustrated after Britain, Canada and the United States began their vaccination programs earlier this month with the same German-developed shot. “It’s here, the good news at Christmas,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference Saturday. “This vaccine is the decisive key to end this pandemic … it is the key to getting our lives back.” The first shipments were limited to just under 10,000 doses in most countries, with the EU’s mass vaccination programs expected to begin only in January. Each country is deciding on its own who will get the first shots — but they are all putting the most vulnerable first. In Hungary, the first shipment of 9,750 doses — enough to vaccinate 4,875 people, since two doses are needed per person — arrived by truck early Saturday and were taken to the South Pest Central Hospital in Budapest. The government said four other hospitals, two in Budapest and two others in the eastern cities of Debrecen and Nyíregyháza, would also receive vaccines from the initial shipment. French authorities said they will prioritize the elderly and the French medical safety agency will monitor the vaccine rollout for any potential problems. Germany, where the pandemic has cost more than 30,000 lives, was beginning with those over 80 and people who take care of vulnerable groups. Spanish authorities said the first batch of the vaccine arrived in the central city of Guadalajara, where the first shots will be administered Sunday morning at a nursing home. In Italy, which has Europe’s worst virus toll at over 71,000 dead, a nurse in Rome’s Spallanzani Hospital, the main infectious diseases facility in the capital, will be the first in the country to receive the vaccine, followed by other health care personnel. In Poland, the first two people to be vaccinated Sunday will be a nurse and a doctor at the Interior Ministry hospital in Warsaw, followed by medical personnel in dozens of other hospitals. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said it was the patriotic duty of Poles to get vaccinated — a message directed at a society where there’s a high degree of vaccine hesitancy born from a distrust of authorities. In Bulgaria, where fears about vaccines also run high, the first person to get the shot will be Health Minister Kostadin Angelov, who has promised an aggressive campaign to promote the benefits of vaccines. In Croatia, a nursing home resident in Zagreb, the capital, will be the first to receive the vaccine on Sunday morning, according to state HRT TV. Authorities also planned to involve celebrities and other public figures in a pro-vaccination campaign. “We have been waiting for this for a year now,” Romanian Prime Minister Florin Catu said Saturday after the first vaccines arrived at a military-run storage facility. The vaccinations began as the first cases of a new virus variant that has been spreading in the U.K. have been detected in France and Spain. The new variant, which British authorities said is much more easily transmitted, has caused European countries, the United States and China to put new restrictions on travel for people from Britain. A French man living in England arrived in France on Dec. 19 and tested positive for the new variant Friday, the French health agency said. He has no symptoms and is isolating at home in the central city of Tours. Health authorities in Madrid confirmed the U.K. variant in four people, all of whom are in good health. Regional health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero said the new strain had arrived when an infected person flew into Madrid’s airport. The German pharmaceutical company  that its coronavirus vaccine works against the new U.K. variant, but said further studies are needed to be completely certain. ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

Mario Díaz-Balart, a Republican, and Donna Shalala, a Democrat, introduced a bill that would enact an 18-month extension to the TPS program for Nicaragua — which, like other TPS designations, the Trump administration has sought to terminate. Díaz-Balart, a Cuban-American lawmaker who has been active shaping U.S. foreign policy in Latin America, said the proposal recognizes the \"reality\" of the recent socio-political crisis engulfing the Central American country.  \"In Nicaragua, you have a left-wing murderous dictatorship that is killing people,\" Díaz-Balart   told CBS News Tuesday. \"Sending Nicaraguans back under those circumstances is unacceptable.\"   In April of last year, the leftist government of President Daniel Ortega, a former guerrilla commander, faced mass public opposition after it proposed cutting several welfare programs and a series of tax hikes. Large protests quickly swept the entire nation and have continued ever since.    \n\n    \n           The Trump administration, along with others governments and international groups, have accused Ortega and his vice president, Rosario Murillo, who is also his wife, of staging a bloody crackdown against dissident groups in the country. Over the last several months, the unrest has killed more than 300 people, according to estimates by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  \n  \n  \n\n \n Shalala, the bill's Democratic sponsor, accused Ortega's government of launching an \"assault\" against Nicaragua's Democratic institutions. \"Extending TPS for Nicaraguans is the right thing to do, especially as the Ortega regime escalates its human rights abuses,\" she added in a statement.  Asked about the seemingly slim likelihood of White House support for the bill, given the president's hardline immigration agenda and intent to end most TPS programs, Díaz-Balart said he believes the administration can still recognize the social and political instability in Nicaragua. Although he disagrees with the White House on ending TPS designations, the Florida Republican said administration officials have been \"trying to enforce the actual law\" on programs that he stressed are designed to be temporary.  Under Mr. Trump's tenure, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced the eventual termination of TPS protections for more than   from El Salvador, Honduras, Sudan and Haiti, but litigation has prevented the administration from dismantling the programs. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate have also introduced bipartisan bills to grant TPS to Venezuelans, but the White House has yet to take an official stance on the proposal.    Díaz-Balart nevertheless praised the Trump administration for reversing President Obama's \"appeasement policy\" and putting pressure on \"rogue, anti-American regimes\" in Latin America. In addition to issuing sanctions against top Nicaraguan officials, the Trump administration has been scathing in its public criticism of the Nicaraguan government, with National Security Adviser John Bolton saying it's part of the \"Troika of Tyranny,\" along with other leftist ruling governments in Cuba and Venezuela.  \n     For Díaz-Balart, these governments in Latin America pose a \"great threat\" to American national security.  \"What is happening in this hemisphere — with Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua — is, I think, more dangerous to the national security interest of the United States than a lot of the things that are taking place in the Middle East,\" he added.   ", "image_url": "<img class=\"content__promo-image\" src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2019/04/30/bf646623-3bc6-47d8-8f5f-504c6dfe99d6/ap-19109736266628.jpg\" height=\"580px\" width=\"1237px\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104039", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

He had a dream that Siraj would play for India in Test cricket. Within a month of his death, my brother has got that god-sent opportunity. It is one of the best news in recent times,’’ brother Ismail, a software Engineer, said from their Toli Chowki residence after hearing that his brother Mohd Siraj will make his Test debut against Australia in Melbourne on Saturday. Ghouse had passed away on November 19. “It was one of the biggest losses for our family. Siraj was inconsolable when he heard that `Abba jaan’ had died. We had great difficulty in controlling his emotions from here to Australia. He was very low in confidence and contemplated at one point even coming back to India. Luckily the Indian team members, particularly Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri, played a big role in consoling him,’’ added Ismail. Ismail pointed out: “My father would always say to Siraj make India proud. Desh Ko Roshan Karo. He always had a proud feeling whenever Siraj played for India. There was always a big smile on his face and sense of satisfaction whenever Siraj donned the Indian colours.’’ From the quaint lanes of Khaja Nagar in Banjara Hills, 26-year-old Siraj has fulfilled his father’s dreams. “We came through a lot of hardships. Being an autorickshaw driver, my father and mother Shabana Begum did all sundry works. I was studious while Siraj was always busy playing cricket in the small lanes. My mother was often upset because Siraj never focused his attention on studies. She would often beat him saying that he is wasting his career by playing the game. “But my father always supported Siraj. He would quietly slip in money in Siraj’s pocket and encouraged him to play cricket. Siraj was very passionate about the game and fast bowling. Today, we are all happy that he is going to play for India in Test cricket, that too at the magnificent MCG ground. He would be having my father’s blessings from heaven. It is a big moment for our family,’’ said Ismail, who had passed his engineering in 2014 and now acts as a manager for his brother. Siraj had moved to Toli Chowki where he could give best comforts to his parents. “We have not sold our father’s auto. He proudly travelled in Jeep Compass in the last few years.’’ Former chairman of National selection Committee MSK Prasad said he always believed Siraj had the potential to play for India. “He is one of the successful cricketers in India A matches. He has taken six or more five-wicket hauls that too against big teams. We thought he was a very good red-ball cricket as he could move the late and was a work-horse.’’ P Jyothi Prasad, who was the chairman of the Hyderabad selection committee when Siraj made his Ranji debut in 2014-15 season, said this Hyderabad fast bowler always excited him. “He had the hunger to excel in big stage.’’ Siraj will be the second Hyderabad fast bowler after Syed Abid Ali, who incidentally made his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide way back in 1966, to play for India in Test cricket. Former Hyderabad opener Abdul Azeem, who was instrumental in shaping Siraj’s career when he gave him cricket shoes etc, said God is great. “I have seen the hardships the family went through.

It added the \"elusive snowman has only been sighted at Makalu-Barun National Park in the past\", referring to footprints reported by British explorer Eric Shipton in 1951 on the west side of Mount Everest. \n  \n  \n\n \n According to folklore, the   lives in the Himalayas but no proof of the enormous creature has ever been produced. Social media users were quick to jump on the Indian military for its tweet. \"With all due respect, institutions such as yours should be more responsible and careful before going ahead and declaring the sighting of any footprints as 'Yeti's'!\", said Kushal Prajapati. \n \"There's been lots of research done on Bigfoot/Yeti (including sighting/footprints) with none proving its existence,\" he added. \n     \"Seriously disappointing to see Army propagating such foolish myths into reality. Expected better from you guys,\" said another comment. Several Twitter observers asked why there was only one footprint when the beast would probably have had two feet. One Twitter user took the opportunity to jab the Indian Army over another dubious claim, about a much more serious topic. In February, amid soaring tension with neighbor Pakistan, India's military claimed to have carried out an airstrike on Pakistani territory that it said had destroyed a terrorist training camp in the Balakot area. However Pakistan insisted the missiles had fallen into an empty forest hillside in the Himalayas, and there was never any evidence the strike had destroyed anything but trees. \"Foot-print suggests that this Yeti is one-legged. Looks like he lost his other leg in Balakote air strike,\" mocked a Twitter user Shah Faesal. \n Others, were more forgiving, though still tongue-in-cheek. \"Congratulations, we are always proud of you. salutes to the #IndianArmy Mountaineering Expedition Team,\" wrote Tarun Vijay, a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. But Vijay said the snowman should not be referred to as \"a beast.\" \n     The army said the footprints measured 32 inches by 15 inches (81 centimeters by 38) and were spotted by a team on April 9 close to the Makalu Base Camp, an isolated area on the Nepal-China frontier. An army official told AFP that pictures were released to \"excite a bit of a scientific temper.\" \"We will share whatever we get with the domain experts to analyse. We will be contacting the team on the satphone in the evening for more details about it. The idea is to find out more, to look for an answer,\" the official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. The yeti is traditionally described as an ape-like creature, taller than a human, that lives in the Himalayas, Siberia, and parts of Central and East Asia. Most scientists have written the creature off as a centuries-old myth originating in Tibet. Forensic results of previous samples have proved to be from prehistoric bears.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg#\" alt=\"George Blake Holding Coat \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/1280x720/a959f53d248f6fb7dc4ddfff51e2e2b3/blake.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104040", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Hopefully, all Cuban soldiers will promptly and peacefully return to their island!\" Mr. Trump wrote in two tweets Tuesday evening. Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, has declared himself interim president of Venezuela and has been recognized as the country's rightful leader by the U.S. and over 50 other countries. \n  \n  \n\n \n Guaidó announced Tuesday morning that key factions of the military were supporting his leadership instead of that of President Nicolas Maduro, and called on Venezuelans to take to the streets to show their opposition to the Maduro regime. Guaidó said that this effort, which he calls \"Operacion Libertad\" -- Operation Liberty -- would be the \"final phase\" of the plan to oust Maduro. Mr. Trump   that he was \"monitoring\" the situation. \"I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!\" Mr. Trump wrote. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in an interview that Maduro had a plane idling on the tarmac to leave Venezuela, but Russians indicated to Maduro that he should stay. Pompeo said that Maduro was headed to Havana, Cuba, and that it is \"a fact\" that Maduro was prepping to depart -- but he did not explain how the U.S. obtained this information. \n     \"It's time for him to leave Venezuela,\" Pompeo said, adding that his advice to Maduro was to \"fire up the plane.\" Vice President Mike Pence   that the U.S. will stand with Venezuela \"until freedom & democracy are restored.\" \"To @jguaido, the National Assembly and all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela who are taking to the streets today in #operacionlibertad-Estamos con ustedes! We are with you! America will stand with you until freedom & democracy are restored. Vayan con dios! #FreeVenezuela,\" Pence wrote on the official Twitter account for the vice president. Pompeo also wrote that \"the U.S. Government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy\"   Tuesday morning. National Security Adviser Bolton responded to Vladimir Padrino, the defense minister of Venezuela, who asserted on Tuesday that Maduro's administration \"reject[s] this coup movement\" by Guaidó and his supporters. \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,\" Bolton said   which tagged Padrino. He later sent another tweet tagging Padrino, Chief Judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Court Maikel Moreno, the commander of the presidential guard Rafael Hernandez-Dala, saying that \"your time is up.\" \"This is your last chance. Accept Interim President Guaido's amnesty, protect the Constitution, and remove Maduro, and we will take you off our sanctions list. Stay with Maduro, and go down with the ship,\" Bolton wrote. Bolton later told reporters that the U.S. would consider intervening in Venezuela. \n     \"We want, as our principal objective, the peaceful transition of power, but I will say again as the president has said from the outset and as Nicolas Maduro and those supporting him -- particularly those who are not Venezuelan -- should know, is all options are on the table,\" Bolton said. \n\n           Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special representative for Venezuela, was more measured in his reaction to the uprising. He said that the situation on the ground remains \"confused\" and he didn't know why the timeline for protests expected for Wednesday got moved to Tuesday. He also said that he wasn't aware of any timeline for negotiations with officials in the Maduro government, referring to Bolton's tweet. These negotiations have been going on among Venezuelans, and not with the U.S., for a \"long time.\" \"I do not recall there being any time limit when the negotiations…were under way,\" Abrams said. Abrams said he texted with Guaidó Tuesday and found him \"buoyant and determined.\" White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney also seemed to tamp down expectations of American intervention in Venezuela Tuesday. \"We are watching it with everyone else,\" Mulvaney said in an interview at the Milken Institute. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, told reporters Tuesday morning that \"Maduro has got to go.\" \n     \"This will finally get the Venezuelan people the freedom that they need,\" Conway said, adding that millions of Venezuelans have fled to Colombia and Brazil to escape the ongoing conflict. \"I'm sure they would prefer to be in their home country, but they simply cant stay there and be expected to survive or thrive.\" Conway said that the administration was \"monitoring\" Guaidó's actions in Venezuela, and that the U.S. wants a \"peaceful transition.\" Some members of Congress have also shown support for Guaidó on Tuesday. Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that he did not see the uprising as a \"coup,\" but \"as an effort to restore democracy.\" He also said that he was willing to consider military intervention. \"If they move on Guaidó and his elements, then, we're trying to restore democracy,\" Graham said. Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, Republican from Florida, said that he urged the administration to be \"firm\" with with regards to policy in Venezuela. \"I obviously urge the administration to continue to be firm and to take whatever further action may be necessary to make sure that, frankly, evil does not prevail in Venezuela and in this hemisphere,\" Díaz-Balart of Florida told CBS News Tuesday afternoon. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/80x80/7d80df8dba322d5cc9233d11e188bbd1/grace-headshot.jpg#\" alt=\"grace-headshot.jpg \" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/80x80/7d80df8dba322d5cc9233d11e188bbd1/grace-headshot.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/160x160/b4361737dd147702392a40fb5df9ed9d/grace-headshot.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2080%2080'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104040", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

In the artificially motorised sperm cells, customised microhelices serve as motors for transporting sperm cells with motion deficiencies to help them carry out their natural function. \"Our results indicate that metal-coated polymer microhelices are suitable for this task due to potent, controllable, and non-harmful 3D motion behaviour,\" researchers said. Sperm that do not swim well rank high among the main causes of infertility. To give these cells a boost, women trying to conceive can turn to artificial insemination or other assisted reproduction techniques, but success can be elusive. Artificial insemination is a relatively inexpensive and simple technique that involves introducing sperm to a woman's uterus with a medical instrument. Overall, the success rate is on average under 30 percent, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority of the UK. In vitro fertilisation can be more effective, but it is a complicated and expensive process. It requires removing eggs from a woman's ovaries with a needle, fertilising them outside the body and then transferring the embryos to her uterus or a surrogate's a few days later. Each step comes with a risk for failure. Researchers from the Institute for Integrative Nanosciences at IFW Dresden in Germany wanted to see if they could come up with a better option than the existing methods. Building on previous work on micromotors, the researchers constructed tiny metal helices just large enough to fit around the tail of a sperm. Their movements can be controlled by a rotating magnetic field. Lab testing showed that the motors can be directed to slip around a sperm cell, drive it to an egg for potential fertilisation and then release it. The researchers say that although much more work needs to be done before their technique can reach clinical testing, the success of their initial demonstration is a promising start. \"Our results indicate that metal-coated polymer microhelices are suitable for this task due to potent, controllable, and non-harmful 3D motion behaviour,\" researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Nano Letters. \"We manage to capture, transport, and release single immotile live sperm cells in fluidic channels that allow mimicking physiological conditions,\" they wrote.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2016/01/15/sperm-file-m.jpg\" title=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104039", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

It is still unclear why there's no doodle for India. Google, you may want to comment on this... The solstice is commonly used to refer to the longest or shortest day of the year. Though it's more accurately described by its astronomical definition. In technical terms, the Solstice occurs when, due to the rotation of the Earth around the Sun, the North Pole is tilted furthest away from the Sun. The Independent explains, \"For those in the Northern Hemisphere, that means less of the Earth's area is covered by the Sun during the day, and when the solstice comes around, the day becomes the shortest of the year.\" Usually, the Winter Solstice falls on 21st December every year, but this year it's on the 22nd, and yes there's a reason too.

One woman fell to her death as she was being placed inside a rescue helicopter. Typhoon Hagibis made landfall south of Tokyo on Saturday evening and battered central and northern Japan with torrents of rain and powerful gusts of wind. The typhoon was downgraded to a tropical storm on Sunday. Public broadcaster NHK said 14 rivers across the nation had flooded, some spilling out in more than one spot. The Tokyo Fire Department said a woman in her 70s was accidentally dropped 40 meters (131 feet) to the ground while being transported into a rescue helicopter in Iwaki city in Fukushima prefecture, a northern area devastated by the typhoon. Department officials held a news conference to apologize, bowing deeply and long, according to Japanese custom, and acknowledged the woman had not been strapped in properly. The government’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency, which tends to be conservative in its counts, said late Sunday that 14 people died, 11 were missing and 187 were injured as a result of the typhoon. It said 1,283 homes were flooded and 517 were damaged, partially or totally. Japanese media tallies were higher. Kyodo News agency reported that 33 people died and 19 were missing. “The major typhoon has caused immense damage far and wide in eastern Japan,” government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters. News footage showed a rescue helicopter hovering in a flooded area in Nagano prefecture where an embankment of the Chikuma River broke, and streams of water were continuing to spread over residential areas. The chopper plucked those stranded on the second floor of a home submerged in muddy waters. Aerial footage showed tractors at work trying to control the flooding and several people on a rooftop, with one waving a white cloth to get the attention of a helicopter. Nearby was a child’s school bag. In another part of Nagano, rows of Japan’s prized bullet trains, parked in a facility, were sitting in a pool of water. A section of the city of Date in Fukushima prefecture was also flooded, with only rooftops of residential homes visible in some areas, and rescuers paddled in boats to get people out. Parts of nearby Miyagi prefecture were also underwater. The Tama River, which runs by Tokyo, overflowed its banks, flooding homes and other buildings in the area. Among the reported deaths were those whose homes were buried in landslides. Other fatalities included people who got swept away by raging rivers. Early Sunday, Suga said that some 376,000 homes were without electricity, and that 14,000 lacked running water. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said late Sunday that more than 66,000 homes were still without power. Tohoku Electric Co. said 5,600 homes still lacked electricity, in the northern prefectures of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima. Both utilities said they were working to restore power. Several train services in the Tokyo area resumed early in the morning, while others restarted later. Ruling party politician Fumio Kishida said the government would do its utmost in rescue operations, including making sure that those who moved to shelters were taken care of. He acknowledged that Japan’s power grids need to be strengthened so people in disaster areas can rely on timely information. “So many risks remain, and it is a reality that we must stay on guard,” Kishida said on news talk show on NHK. “We must do our utmost. In these times, a disaster can hit anytime.” The Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada, scheduled for Sunday in Kamaishi, in northern Japan, was canceled as a precautionary measure, but Japan played Scotland, to a win, as scheduled Sunday evening. Matches on Saturday had been canceled. Stores and amusement parks had also closed, and some Tokyo stores remained closed Sunday. As the typhoon bore down on Saturday with heavy rain and strong winds, the usually crowded train stations and bustling streets of Tokyo were deserted. But life was returning to normal on Sunday, and flights that had been grounded from Tokyo airports were gradually being resumed. Evacuation centers had been set up in coastal towns, with tens of thousands seeking shelter. Kyodo News agency said evacuation warnings had been issued to more than 6 million people. The typhoon disrupted a three-day weekend in Japan that includes Sports Day on Monday. The authorities had repeatedly warned that Hagibis was on par with a typhoon that wreaked havoc on the Tokyo region in 1958, but the safety infrastructure that Japan’s modernization has brought was apparent. The typhoon six decades ago left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104040", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104039", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, has declared himself interim president of Venezuela and has been recognized as the country's rightful leader by the U.S. and over 50 other countries. \n  \n  \n\n \n Guaidó announced Tuesday morning that key factions of the military were supporting his leadership instead of that of President Nicolas Maduro, and called on Venezuelans to take to the streets to show their opposition to the Maduro regime.

Mr. Trump   that he was \"monitoring\" the situation. \"I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!\" Mr. Trump wrote. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in an interview that Maduro had a plane idling on the tarmac to leave Venezuela, but Russians indicated to Maduro that he should stay. Pompeo said that Maduro was headed to Havana, Cuba, and that it is \"a fact\" that Maduro was prepping to depart -- but he did not explain how the U.S. obtained this information. \n     \"It's time for him to leave Venezuela,\" Pompeo said, adding that his advice to Maduro was to \"fire up the plane.\" Vice President Mike Pence   that the U.S. will stand with Venezuela \"until freedom & democracy are restored.\" \"To @jguaido, the National Assembly and all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela who are taking to the streets today in #operacionlibertad-Estamos con ustedes! We are with you! America will stand with you until freedom & democracy are restored. Vayan con dios! #FreeVenezuela,\" Pence wrote on the official Twitter account for the vice president. Pompeo also wrote that \"the U.S. Government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy\"   Tuesday morning. National Security Adviser Bolton responded to Vladimir Padrino, the defense minister of Venezuela, who asserted on Tuesday that Maduro's administration \"reject[s] this coup movement\" by Guaidó and his supporters. \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,\" Bolton said   which tagged Padrino. He later sent another tweet tagging Padrino, Chief Judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Court Maikel Moreno, the commander of the presidential guard Rafael Hernandez-Dala, saying that \"your time is up.\" \"This is your last chance. Accept Interim President Guaido's amnesty, protect the Constitution, and remove Maduro, and we will take you off our sanctions list. Stay with Maduro, and go down with the ship,\" Bolton wrote. Bolton later told reporters that the U.S. would consider intervening in Venezuela. \n     \"We want, as our principal objective, the peaceful transition of power, but I will say again as the president has said from the outset and as Nicolas Maduro and those supporting him -- particularly those who are not Venezuelan -- should know, is all options are on the table,\" Bolton said. \n\n           Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special representative for Venezuela, was more measured in his reaction to the uprising. He said that the situation on the ground remains \"confused\" and he didn't know why the timeline for protests expected for Wednesday got moved to Tuesday. He also said that he wasn't aware of any timeline for negotiations with officials in the Maduro government, referring to Bolton's tweet. These negotiations have been going on among Venezuelans, and not with the U.S., for a \"long time.\" \"I do not recall there being any time limit when the negotiations…were under way,\" Abrams said. Abrams said he texted with Guaidó Tuesday and found him \"buoyant and determined.\" White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney also seemed to tamp down expectations of American intervention in Venezuela Tuesday. \"We are watching it with everyone else,\" Mulvaney said in an interview at the Milken Institute. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, told reporters Tuesday morning that \"Maduro has got to go.\" \n     \"This will finally get the Venezuelan people the freedom that they need,\" Conway said, adding that millions of Venezuelans have fled to Colombia and Brazil to escape the ongoing conflict. \"I'm sure they would prefer to be in their home country, but they simply cant stay there and be expected to survive or thrive.\" Conway said that the administration was \"monitoring\" Guaidó's actions in Venezuela, and that the U.S. wants a \"peaceful transition.\" Some members of Congress have also shown support for Guaidó on Tuesday. Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that he did not see the uprising as a \"coup,\" but \"as an effort to restore democracy.\" He also said that he was willing to consider military intervention. \"If they move on Guaidó and his elements, then, we're trying to restore democracy,\" Graham said. Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, Republican from Florida, said that he urged the administration to be \"firm\" with with regards to policy in Venezuela. \"I obviously urge the administration to continue to be firm and to take whatever further action may be necessary to make sure that, frankly, evil does not prevail in Venezuela and in this hemisphere,\" Díaz-Balart of Florida told CBS News Tuesday afternoon. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/80x80/7d80df8dba322d5cc9233d11e188bbd1/grace-headshot.jpg#\" alt=\"grace-headshot.jpg \" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/80x80/7d80df8dba322d5cc9233d11e188bbd1/grace-headshot.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/160x160/b4361737dd147702392a40fb5df9ed9d/grace-headshot.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2080%2080'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104040", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Top U.S. officials, including  , were quick to vouch their support for Guaidó's bid to oust Maduro. \n\n    \n           Venezuela's socialist government, meanwhile, called the move by the opposition leader a \"coup\" sponsored by the U.S., with one of its most highest-ranking officials and speaker of the pro-Maduro legislature, Diosdado Cabello, urging supporters to come out and defend the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas. \n  \n  \n\n \n Clashes in the capital and other parts of the country  ensued between civilians and soldiers supportive of Guaidó and Maduro's security forces and pro-government militias, known as \"colectivos.\" Roberto Ampuero, Chile's Minister of Foreign Affairs, said the Chilean embassy in Caracas was hosting Lopez and his family as \"guests.\" The bold action by the opposition could allow the international community and people of Venezuela to gauge whether Guaidó can accomplish what has so far proved elusive: mustering enough support among the nation's sprawling military structure to force Maduro to relinquish power. On Tuesday night, in his first public appearance since Guaidó announced the \"final phase\" of his bid to take power, Maduro said his government had defeated the \"small\" uprising, which he denounced as a coup attempt organized by fascists and U.S. lackeys. He said the attorney general had designated three special prosecutors to investigate the uprising and interrogate those involved. In first public appearance, Maduro proclaims \"defeat\" of uprising On Tuesday night, in his first public appearance since Guaidó announced the \"final phase\" of his bid to take power, Maduro said his government had defeated the \"small\" uprising, which he denounced as a coup attempt organized by Venezuela 's far-right and U.S. lackeys.  \n     In a televised speech alongside top government officials and military leaders, Maduro said the attorney general had designated three special prosecutors to investigate the uprising and interrogate those involved, who he accused of wanting to provoke a \"massacre\"  \"The traitors will soon see what their fate is,\" Maduro said. ​Lawmaker urges Trump to take whatever action necessary to stop \"evil\" in Venezuela A Republican lawmaker urged President Trump to be \"firm\" and take whatever action may be necessary to stop \"evil\" in Venezuela. \"I obviously urge the administration to continue to be firm and to take whatever further action may be necessary to make sure that, frankly, evil does not prevail in Venezuela and in this hemisphere,\" Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida told CBS News Tuesday afternoon. Díaz-Balart called Maduro's increasingly authoritarian regime, which a coalition of Western countries have urged to hold  , a \"great threat\" to American national security, alongside other leftist governments in Latin America. \"What is happening in this hemisphere -- with Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua -- is, I think, more dangerous to the national security interest of the United States than a lot of the things that are taking place in the Middle East,\" he added. Pompeo: Maduro was \"ready to leave\" Venezuela Pompeo said Maduro prepared to flee Venezuela Tuesday morning, but backed off the move because of advise from the Russia government. \n     \"He had an airplane on the tarmac. He was ready to leave this morning, as we understand it. And the Russians indicated he should stay,\" Pompeo said during an appearance on CNN late Tuesday afternoon. \"He was headed for Havana,\" the secretary of state added, referring to the Cuban capital. Pressed for evidence, Pompeo said his claim was based on \"conversations.\" Doctors treat 50 injured in skirmishes The director of a medical center in Venezuela's capital said doctors are treating 50 patients injured during street skirmishes. Thirty of the injured were shot with rubber bullets, according to Salud Chacao director Maggia Santi. Another 16 sustained bodily trauma, while three reported difficulty breathing and one was shot with a firearm. She said doctors have sufficient supplies to treat the injured, in part due to recent donations by organizations including the Red Cross. Brazil sees point of no return in Venezuela Brazil's vice president said the situation in Venezuela has reached a point of no return. Former Gen. Hamilton Mourão said Tuesday that either opposition leaders Guaidó and Leopoldo López would \"be prisoners\" or  Maduro \"would be leaving.\" \n     \"There is no other way out of this,\" Mourão said. Brazil borders Venezuela to the south and recognizes Guaidó as Venezuela's legitimate president. Bolton: \"All options are on the table\" President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton said Tuesday that Mr. Trump wants to see a peaceful transfer of power in Venezuela -- a possibility he said \"still exists.\" He also said \"all options are on the table.\" Speaking to reporters at the White House Tuesday afternoon, Bolton said what is happening in Venezuela \"is clearly not a coup.\" \"We recognize Juan Guaido as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela, and just as it's not a coup when the President of the United States gives an order to the Department of Defense, it's not a coup for Juan Guaido to try and take command of the Venezuelan military,\" he said. \r\n Bolton also said the U.S. believes Cuba has played \"a very significant role in propping Maduro up today, possibly with help from the Russians. That's the speculation, certainly in Caracas.\" \n     \"The sooner Maduro is gone, the sooner is the possibility of justice and real economic growth for the Venezuelan people,\" he said. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump , \"The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!\" UN chief urges \"maximum restraint\" The U.N. says Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging all sides in Venezuela to exercise \"maximum restraint,\" avoid any violence and take immediate steps to restore calm. Guterres' \"message publicly and privately has been to push for dialogue in order to resolve this peacefully,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Tuesday. Dujarric said the U.N. is \"reaching out to both sides.\" He noted that Guterres met Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza last week and met Monday with the Lima group of countries supporting Guaidó. Dujarric also said the U.N. is taking measures to ensure the safety of its staff in the country. Street clashes erupt \n\n           Anti-government demonstrators clashed with troops loyal to Maduro at an air base in Caracas, the country's capital, hours after Guaidó's attempt to lead a military uprising. Video showed unrest, including clashes, as well as an armored military vehicle ramming into pro-Guaidó protesters in the city. \r\n Internet restrictions reported in Venezuela Venezuela's state run internet provider has been restricting access to YouTube and Google services following the opposition leader's call for the military to revolt against Maduro, a group that monitors internet censorship said. \n     The non-governmental NetBlocks group said access to the services remains intermittently available since the restrictions don't appear to be completely effective. It said Twitter, Facebook and several other services were briefly restricted earlier, although core internet connectivity remains unaffected. The group said past incidents of network filtering in Venezuela have lasted from 12 minutes to over 20 hours. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Defense minister rejects attempt by \"subversive movement\" The events appear not to have triggered a broader military revolt. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino on Twitter rejected what he called an attempt by a \"subversive movement\" to generate \"panic and terror.\" The ruling socialist party chief, Diosdado Cabello, said most of Caracas was calm and called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend Maduro from what he said was a U.S.-backed coup attempt. About a dozen government supporters, some of them brandishing firearms, gathered at the presidential palace, answered the call. \"It's time to defend the revolution with arms,\" Valentin Santana, head of a militant group, said in a video posted on social media as he brandished an automatic rifle. Meanwhile, Guaidó said he would release a list of top commanders supporting the uprising in the coming hours. \n     Putin discusses uprising with his top security body Russian President Vladimir Putin has discussed the ongoing uprising in Venezuela with his top security body. Putin raised the current developments in Venezuela during his scheduled meeting with the Security Council, Russian news agencies quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. Peskov said that the meeting \"paid significant attention to the news reports about a coup attempt in that country.\" He did not elaborate further. Pence: \"We are with you!\" U.S. Vice President Mike Pence tweeted \"We are with you!\" Tuesday to the Venezuelans taking to the streets after Guaidó's call for an uprising. \"America will stand with you until freedom & democracy are restored,\" he added. The U.S. and dozens of other countries have recognized Guaidó as Venezuela's rightful leader, arguing that Maduro's re-  was invalid. \r\n The White House later said it is \"watching and waiting\" on the situation in Venezuela and hoping the result is democracy. It was unclear how much advance knowledge the Trump administration had of Guaido's plans for Tuesday, but President Trump's national security adviser John Bolton was first to tweet his support. \n     \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,\" Bolton ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/ccd4efe4-d518-469d-8a0c-5dc465e88dcf/thumbnail/620x413/4afafdcf4d94fb5a9c0a2efb266a1a83/ap-19120582736136.jpg#\" alt=\"ap-19120582736136.jpg \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/ccd4efe4-d518-469d-8a0c-5dc465e88dcf/thumbnail/620x413/4afafdcf4d94fb5a9c0a2efb266a1a83/ap-19120582736136.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/ccd4efe4-d518-469d-8a0c-5dc465e88dcf/thumbnail/1240x826/c0161f137b027630a63240baeb72de7f/ap-19120582736136.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104041", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.cnn.com", "section": "Weather", "sub_section": "Opinion", "article_url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/27/opinions/2021-predictions-opinion-column-fredrick-williams/index.html", "title": "The winners of the post-Trump era", "author": "", "author_link": null, "published_date": "Updated 10:35 AM ET, Sun December 27, 2020", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "While many of last year's contributors successfully predicted the winners of entertainment awards,  correctly guessed that Joe Biden would be the winner of the 2020 US presidential election —  ,  ,   and  .

There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue.

What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.

Opposition supporters have rallied for weeks, urging Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down over the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim control over large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. The Russia-brokered agreement ended 44 days of fierce fighting in which the Azerbaijani army routed Armenian forces. Pashinyan has defended the peace deal as a painful but necessary move to prevent Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region. He argued Friday that his critics lack broad public support for their demand. “I’m not clinging to the prime minister’s seat, but I can’t carelessly treat the post given to me by the people,” he said on Facebook. Pashinyan added that he was ready to hold consultations with the nation’s political parties to discuss calling an early parliamentary election next year. Opposition supporters on Friday continued blocking streets in the Armenian capital and engaged in occasional scuffles with police. Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands. Heavy fighting that erupted in late September marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 5,600 people on both sides. The Russia-brokered peace agreement stipulated that Armenia hand over control of some areas it holds outside Nagorno-Karabakh’s borders. Azerbaijan also retained control over areas of Nagorno-Karabakh it had taken during the conflict.

Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb announced the figure at a Cabinet meeting Thursday. The government didn’t indicate whether the vaccines were purchased or provided by Covax, the global project to provide vaccines to developing countries, or a combination of both. His ministry said Friday that Morocco has not yet received the vaccines. Mustapha Ennaji Moulay, head of the virology department at the Hassan II University in Casablanca and a member of the government’s COVID-19 scientific committee, said that regulators are reviewing the Sinopharm vaccine’s documentation, and that the vaccination program is expected to begin in the coming days. Morocco has one of the most advanced vaccination plans in the region. The country has also reported the second-highest number of virus infections and deaths in Africa, after South Africa. The Moroccan health minister said the government’s target is vaccinating 25 million of the country’s 36 million people, all free of charge, according to orders from King Mohammed VI. While the Moroccan government has been promising vaccinations since earlier this month, the minister said preparations have now reached a “very advanced” stage. He said authorities were carrying out simulations at all the immunization sites “to avoid any obstacles that may arise during the implementation of the vaccination program.” In a first phase, the vaccine will be administered to medical personnel, public authorities, security services, education workers and people suffering from chronic diseases. The Ministry of Health said it has deployed a computerized system to register the target population and track their health status after they receive the vaccine. Moulay said Morocco has sought to diversify supply by signing contracts with multiple countries. Morocco has said it will start its vaccination program with the Sinopharm vaccine, though it hasn’t yet completed advanced trials to prove that it’s safe and effective. The vaccine, which was tested on 600 Moroccans as part of clinical trials this autumn, has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in multiple countries. Morocco’s initial vaccine deliveries will come from China, but Morocco also plans to produce the vaccine locally. The AstraZeneca vaccine is still in advanced trials in countries including Britain and the U.S. and hasn’t been approved yet. Morocco’s daily virus case count has fallen slightly in the last two weeks, but a dip in testing is raising concerns that the virus could be spreading faster than reported. As a preventive measure to curb the spread of the virus during New Year’s celebrations, authorities banned public and private gatherings, closed restaurants in the country’s main cities, and imposed a curfew that went into effect Wednesday night and is set to last for three weeks.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104040", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Her skeletal remains provided scientists with invaluable information regarding the human race and its evolution, and Google is celebrating this day with a Doodle. Lucy Australopithecus has been proven to have lived around 3.2 million years ago in Ehtiopia. The Google Doodle dedicated to her today shows three stages of Lucy's evolution. Currently, Lucy's bones are kept in a museum in Ethiopia. Here's more about our ancestor Lucy: 1) 'Lucy' was the first Australopithecus afarensis skeleton ever found. Australopithecus afarensis is a species that shares both human and ape characteristics that lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago. Around 40 per cent of Lucy's remains were discovered intact. 2) Do you know who named her Lucy? Paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson named the fossils Lucy after the Beatles song ' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.' 3) Lucy is a crucial stepping stone between apes and Homo Sapiens. It was exactly 41 years ago from today when the oldest known example of a bipedal primate came into the knowledge of humans. 4) Lucy had numerous similarities with chimpanzees.The skeleton revealed that she mostly walked upright. Bipedalism, walking using two rear limbs or legs, is a key distinction between Homo Sapiens and chimpanzees. 5) According to  , with a mixture of ape and human features - including long dangling arms with pelvic, spine, foot, and leg bones suited to walking upright - slender Lucy stood three-and-a-half feet tall. 6) Lucy is determined as a female due to her size. Fossils that were discovered later were larger in size and were identified as males. 7) Lucy was fully grown, for her wisdom teeth were very human-like. They were exposed and had been in use for a while before her death.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"http://images.catchnews.com/uploads/images/2015/11/24/lucy-skeleton.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy_Skeleton.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104040", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The research is on the decay of subatomic particles called 'kaons', which could change how scientists understand the formation of the universe. University of Southampton's Christopher Sachrajda has helped to devise the first calculation of how the behaviour of kaons differs when matter is swapped out for antimatter, known as direct \"CP\" symmetry violation. Should the calculation not match experimental results, it would be conclusive evidence of new, unknown phenomena that lie outside of the Standard Model--physicists' present understanding of the fundamental particles and the forces between them. The current result does not yet indicate such a difference between experiment and theory, but scientists expect the precision of the calculation to improve dramatically now that they've proven they can tackle the task. The study appears in Physical Review Letters.

Earth's oxygen-rich atmosphere emerged in whiffs from a kind of blue-green algae in shallow oceans around 2.5 billion years ago, according to the study from Canadian and US scientists. These whiffs of oxygen likely happened in the following 100 million years, changing the levels of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere until enough accumulated to create a permanently oxygenated atmosphere around 2.4 billion years ago - a transition widely known as the Great Oxidation Event. The onset of Earth's surface oxygenation was likely a complex process characterized by multiple whiffs of oxygen until a tipping point was crossed, said Brian Kendall of the University of Waterloo. \"Until now, we haven't been able to tell whether oxygen concentrations 2.5 billion years ago were stable or not. These new data provide a much more conclusive answer to that question.\" The study is published in Science Advances.

Lyubov Sobol, a key figure in Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained for 48 hours after a day of interrogation on charges of violent trespassing. The move followed Sobol’s attempt on Monday to enter the Moscow apartment of the alleged operative, whom Navalny had previously duped into describing details of the alleged poisoning.  Sobol has denied the accusations and insisted that she violated no law by ringing the doorbell to the apartment. While Sobol was being questioned, the state Investigative Committee issued a statement accusing her of trespassing — charges her colleagues have rejected.

Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned. In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake.

Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned. In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake.

The Court's silence here is exceptionally wise. Often when divided 4-4, the justices do not write, but, at times, at least   do. Why did Chief Justice Roberts and the justices who voted with him not explain their reasons? Why did the other conservative justices, in dissent, not speak either? The reason, paradoxically, is likely precisely because the stakes were too high to say anything at all; the issues are too momentous; the election too imminent.   This case has a clear link to  : It centered on an issue that Bush v. Gore had addressed but not fully resolved. That is almost certainly why the Court spent so long trying to figure out how to handle the case.

The monumental issue in the case was what the word \"legislature\" means in the Constitution. That might sound simple, but the answer has ramifications that reverberate throughout the Constitution. That's because the term \"legislature\"   in the Constitution 17 times. Each time it does, the legal question is whether \"legislature\" is best understood to mean (1) the ordinary lawmaking processes of a state or (2) only the formal institution of the legislature itself.

In February, amid soaring tension with neighbor Pakistan, India's military claimed to have carried out an airstrike on Pakistani territory that it said had destroyed a terrorist training camp in the Balakot area. However Pakistan insisted the missiles had fallen into an empty forest hillside in the Himalayas, and there was never any evidence the strike had destroyed anything but trees. \"Foot-print suggests that this Yeti is one-legged.

An army official told AFP that pictures were released to \"excite a bit of a scientific temper.\" \"We will share whatever we get with the domain experts to analyse. We will be contacting the team on the satphone in the evening for more details about it. The idea is to find out more, to look for an answer,\" the official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. The yeti is traditionally described as an ape-like creature, taller than a human, that lives in the Himalayas, Siberia, and parts of Central and East Asia.

Opposition supporters have rallied for weeks, urging Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down over the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim control over large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. The Russia-brokered agreement ended 44 days of fierce fighting in which the Azerbaijani army routed Armenian forces. Pashinyan has defended the peace deal as a painful but necessary move to prevent Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region. He argued Friday that his critics lack broad public support for their demand. “I’m not clinging to the prime minister’s seat, but I can’t carelessly treat the post given to me by the people,” he said on Facebook. Pashinyan added that he was ready to hold consultations with the nation’s political parties to discuss calling an early parliamentary election next year. Opposition supporters on Friday continued blocking streets in the Armenian capital and engaged in occasional scuffles with police. Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands. Heavy fighting that erupted in late September marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 5,600 people on both sides. The Russia-brokered peace agreement stipulated that Armenia hand over control of some areas it holds outside Nagorno-Karabakh’s borders. Azerbaijan also retained control over areas of Nagorno-Karabakh it had taken during the conflict.

The first person at the home to be immunized with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 101-year-old Edith Kwoizalla, the DPA news agency reported. Krueger said 40 of the home’s 59 residents wanted the immunization shot along with 10 of around 40 workers. He was among those immunized but added, “I also understand the concerns.” In Hungary, health care workers were vaccinated at the Southern Pest Central Hospital in Budapest, while in Slovakia, the first person to receive a jab was a 60-year-old top expert on infectious diseases, Vladimir Krcmery. He was vaccinated along with doctors at the University Hospital in the city of Nitra, in what Health Minister Marek Krajci called a “historic moment.” The first shipments of the vaccine arrived at hospitals across the EU in super-cold containers late Friday and early Saturday after being sent from a manufacturing center in Belgium before Christmas. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen released a video celebrating the vaccine rollout for the bloc of nearly 450 million people, calling it “a touching moment of unity.” “Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year. The COVID-19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries. Vaccination will begin tomorrow across the EU,” she said. The rollout marks a moment of hope for a region that includes some of the world’s earliest and worst-hit virus hot spots — Italy and Spain — and others like the Czech Republic, which were spared early on only to see their health care systems near their breaking point in the fall. In all, EU nations have recorded at least 16 million coronavirus infections and more than 336,000 deaths — huge numbers that experts agree still understate the true toll of the pandemic due to missed cases and limited testing. Still, the vaccine rollout helps the bloc project a sense of unity in a complex lifesaving mission after it faced a year of difficulties in negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain. It also brings a sigh of relief for EU politicians who were frustrated after Britain, Canada and the United States began their vaccination programs earlier this month with the same German-developed shot. “It’s here, the good news at Christmas,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference Saturday. “This vaccine is the decisive key to end this pandemic … it is the key to getting our lives back.” The first shipments were limited to just under 10,000 doses in most countries, with the EU’s mass vaccination programs expected to begin only in January. Each country is deciding on its own who will get the first shots — but they are all putting the most vulnerable first. In Hungary, the first shipment of 9,750 doses — enough to vaccinate 4,875 people, since two doses are needed per person — arrived by truck early Saturday and were taken to the South Pest Central Hospital in Budapest. The government said four other hospitals, two in Budapest and two others in the eastern cities of Debrecen and Nyíregyháza, would also receive vaccines from the initial shipment. French authorities said they will prioritize the elderly and the French medical safety agency will monitor the vaccine rollout for any potential problems. Germany, where the pandemic has cost more than 30,000 lives, was beginning with those over 80 and people who take care of vulnerable groups. Spanish authorities said the first batch of the vaccine arrived in the central city of Guadalajara, where the first shots will be administered Sunday morning at a nursing home. In Italy, which has Europe’s worst virus toll at over 71,000 dead, a nurse in Rome’s Spallanzani Hospital, the main infectious diseases facility in the capital, will be the first in the country to receive the vaccine, followed by other health care personnel. In Poland, the first two people to be vaccinated Sunday will be a nurse and a doctor at the Interior Ministry hospital in Warsaw, followed by medical personnel in dozens of other hospitals. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said it was the patriotic duty of Poles to get vaccinated — a message directed at a society where there’s a high degree of vaccine hesitancy born from a distrust of authorities. In Bulgaria, where fears about vaccines also run high, the first person to get the shot will be Health Minister Kostadin Angelov, who has promised an aggressive campaign to promote the benefits of vaccines. In Croatia, a nursing home resident in Zagreb, the capital, will be the first to receive the vaccine on Sunday morning, according to state HRT TV. Authorities also planned to involve celebrities and other public figures in a pro-vaccination campaign. “We have been waiting for this for a year now,” Romanian Prime Minister Florin Catu said Saturday after the first vaccines arrived at a military-run storage facility. The vaccinations began as the first cases of a new virus variant that has been spreading in the U.K. have been detected in France and Spain. The new variant, which British authorities said is much more easily transmitted, has caused European countries, the United States and China to put new restrictions on travel for people from Britain. A French man living in England arrived in France on Dec. 19 and tested positive for the new variant Friday, the French health agency said. He has no symptoms and is isolating at home in the central city of Tours. Health authorities in Madrid confirmed the U.K. variant in four people, all of whom are in good health. Regional health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero said the new strain had arrived when an infected person flew into Madrid’s airport. The German pharmaceutical company  that its coronavirus vaccine works against the new U.K. variant, but said further studies are needed to be completely certain. ___ Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

It added the \"elusive snowman has only been sighted at Makalu-Barun National Park in the past\", referring to footprints reported by British explorer Eric Shipton in 1951 on the west side of Mount Everest. \n  \n  \n\n \n According to folklore, the   lives in the Himalayas but no proof of the enormous creature has ever been produced. Social media users were quick to jump on the Indian military for its tweet. \"With all due respect, institutions such as yours should be more responsible and careful before going ahead and declaring the sighting of any footprints as 'Yeti's'!\", said Kushal Prajapati. \n \"There's been lots of research done on Bigfoot/Yeti (including sighting/footprints) with none proving its existence,\" he added. \n     \"Seriously disappointing to see Army propagating such foolish myths into reality. Expected better from you guys,\" said another comment. Several Twitter observers asked why there was only one footprint when the beast would probably have had two feet.

Guaidó, the president of the National Assembly, has declared himself interim president of Venezuela and has been recognized as the country's rightful leader by the U.S. and over 50 other countries. \n  \n  \n\n \n Guaidó announced Tuesday morning that key factions of the military were supporting his leadership instead of that of President Nicolas Maduro, and called on Venezuelans to take to the streets to show their opposition to the Maduro regime. Guaidó said that this effort, which he calls \"Operacion Libertad\" -- Operation Liberty -- would be the \"final phase\" of the plan to oust Maduro. Mr. Trump   that he was \"monitoring\" the situation. \"I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!\" Mr. Trump wrote. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in an interview that Maduro had a plane idling on the tarmac to leave Venezuela, but Russians indicated to Maduro that he should stay. Pompeo said that Maduro was headed to Havana, Cuba, and that it is \"a fact\" that Maduro was prepping to depart -- but he did not explain how the U.S. obtained this information. \n     \"It's time for him to leave Venezuela,\" Pompeo said, adding that his advice to Maduro was to \"fire up the plane.\" Vice President Mike Pence   that the U.S. will stand with Venezuela \"until freedom & democracy are restored.\" \"To @jguaido, the National Assembly and all the freedom-loving people of Venezuela who are taking to the streets today in #operacionlibertad-Estamos con ustedes! We are with you! America will stand with you until freedom & democracy are restored. Vayan con dios! #FreeVenezuela,\" Pence wrote on the official Twitter account for the vice president. Pompeo also wrote that \"the U.S. Government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy\"   Tuesday morning. National Security Adviser Bolton responded to Vladimir Padrino, the defense minister of Venezuela, who asserted on Tuesday that Maduro's administration \"reject[s] this coup movement\" by Guaidó and his supporters. \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela,\" Bolton said   which tagged Padrino. He later sent another tweet tagging Padrino, Chief Judge of the Venezuelan Supreme Court Maikel Moreno, the commander of the presidential guard Rafael Hernandez-Dala, saying that \"your time is up.\" \"This is your last chance. Accept Interim President Guaido's amnesty, protect the Constitution, and remove Maduro, and we will take you off our sanctions list. Stay with Maduro, and go down with the ship,\" Bolton wrote. Bolton later told reporters that the U.S. would consider intervening in Venezuela. \n     \"We want, as our principal objective, the peaceful transition of power, but I will say again as the president has said from the outset and as Nicolas Maduro and those supporting him -- particularly those who are not Venezuelan -- should know, is all options are on the table,\" Bolton said. \n\n           Elliott Abrams, the U.S. special representative for Venezuela, was more measured in his reaction to the uprising. He said that the situation on the ground remains \"confused\" and he didn't know why the timeline for protests expected for Wednesday got moved to Tuesday. He also said that he wasn't aware of any timeline for negotiations with officials in the Maduro government, referring to Bolton's tweet. These negotiations have been going on among Venezuelans, and not with the U.S., for a \"long time.\" \"I do not recall there being any time limit when the negotiations…were under way,\" Abrams said. Abrams said he texted with Guaidó Tuesday and found him \"buoyant and determined.\" White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney also seemed to tamp down expectations of American intervention in Venezuela Tuesday. \"We are watching it with everyone else,\" Mulvaney said in an interview at the Milken Institute. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, told reporters Tuesday morning that \"Maduro has got to go.\" \n     \"This will finally get the Venezuelan people the freedom that they need,\" Conway said, adding that millions of Venezuelans have fled to Colombia and Brazil to escape the ongoing conflict. \"I'm sure they would prefer to be in their home country, but they simply cant stay there and be expected to survive or thrive.\" Conway said that the administration was \"monitoring\" Guaidó's actions in Venezuela, and that the U.S. wants a \"peaceful transition.\" Some members of Congress have also shown support for Guaidó on Tuesday. Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that he did not see the uprising as a \"coup,\" but \"as an effort to restore democracy.\" He also said that he was willing to consider military intervention. \"If they move on Guaidó and his elements, then, we're trying to restore democracy,\" Graham said. Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, Republican from Florida, said that he urged the administration to be \"firm\" with with regards to policy in Venezuela. \"I obviously urge the administration to continue to be firm and to take whatever further action may be necessary to make sure that, frankly, evil does not prevail in Venezuela and in this hemisphere,\" Díaz-Balart of Florida told CBS News Tuesday afternoon. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/80x80/7d80df8dba322d5cc9233d11e188bbd1/grace-headshot.jpg#\" alt=\"grace-headshot.jpg \" height=\"80\" width=\"80\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/80x80/7d80df8dba322d5cc9233d11e188bbd1/grace-headshot.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/8f13a028-1107-43d4-b08d-4f9cf2610299/thumbnail/160x160/b4361737dd147702392a40fb5df9ed9d/grace-headshot.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%2080%2080'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104044", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Two other police officers were wounded when a bomb attached to their car exploded earlier Saturday in southern Kabul, Faramarz said. Maooma Jafari, deputy spokeswoman for the health ministry, said that four corpses and four wounded people were taken to hospital following the two explosions. A third sticky bomb detonated in eastern Kabul but caused no casualties, he said. There were reports of at least two other blasts elsewhere in the city but police had no immediate details.

No one has immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Kabul. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital in recent months, including on educational institutions that killed 50 people, most of them students. The talks in Doha have been suspended until early January and there is speculation they could be further delayed. At the same time, Taliban militants have waged bitter battles against IS fighters, particularly in eastern Afghanistan, while continuing their insurgency against government forces and keeping their promise not to attack U.S. and NATO troops.

Opposition supporters have rallied for weeks, urging Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down over the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim control over large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. The Russia-brokered agreement ended 44 days of fierce fighting in which the Azerbaijani army routed Armenian forces. Pashinyan has defended the peace deal as a painful but necessary move to prevent Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region. He argued Friday that his critics lack broad public support for their demand. “I’m not clinging to the prime minister’s seat, but I can’t carelessly treat the post given to me by the people,” he said on Facebook. Pashinyan added that he was ready to hold consultations with the nation’s political parties to discuss calling an early parliamentary election next year. Opposition supporters on Friday continued blocking streets in the Armenian capital and engaged in occasional scuffles with police. Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands. Heavy fighting that erupted in late September marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 5,600 people on both sides.

With the UN estimating that at the end of 2019 there were 79.5 million   people, the refugee crisis is at its height, while the US humanitarian response is at a shocking low.  As our country's leadership turns its back on people in desperate need of help, people like me have had to take action. Five years ago, I founded a program that provides daily meals to nine Sudanese and Eritrean refugee daycares in South Tel Aviv in Israel. I made an award-winning short-film about this program, which I called \"Food Refuge.\"  Most recently, I've worked with an Afghani refugee family in the Bronx, supporting their two young boys' transition into the American school system. This past summer, between my junior and senior years of high school, I conducted extensive research on refugees' contributions to the US economy under the mentorship of a Columbia University professor. I hope that my research helps convince even the most skeptical Americans that admitting refugees into our country is not only a humanitarian obligation, but also an economic cause.

The trademark solstice doodle appears on Google homepage in the countries situated above the zero degree latitude called the Equator.  The Doodle depicts two happy ice-skaters gliding around a snow globe, depicting cold and snowy winter.  The solstice occurs at the same time for everyone across the globe and this year's starts at at 4:49am GMT on 22 December. Well, this question arises here because India lies in the Northern Hemisphere. And going by this logic, we should have got a chance a enjoy a Doodle. It is still unclear why there's no doodle for India. Google, you may want to comment on this... The solstice is commonly used to refer to the longest or shortest day of the year. Though it's more accurately described by its astronomical definition. In technical terms, the Solstice occurs when, due to the rotation of the Earth around the Sun, the North Pole is tilted furthest away from the Sun. The Independent explains, \"For those in the Northern Hemisphere, that means less of the Earth's area is covered by the Sun during the day, and when the solstice comes around, the day becomes the shortest of the year.\" Usually, the Winter Solstice falls on 21st December every year, but this year it's on the 22nd, and yes there's a reason too. The time may vary each year, and given a slight discrepancy in the time that we use and the solar time - a variation which is rectified every four years, when a leap year occurs and we get an extra day on the calendar.

Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb announced the figure at a Cabinet meeting Thursday. The government didn’t indicate whether the vaccines were purchased or provided by Covax, the global project to provide vaccines to developing countries, or a combination of both. His ministry said Friday that Morocco has not yet received the vaccines. Mustapha Ennaji Moulay, head of the virology department at the Hassan II University in Casablanca and a member of the government’s COVID-19 scientific committee, said that regulators are reviewing the Sinopharm vaccine’s documentation, and that the vaccination program is expected to begin in the coming days. Morocco has one of the most advanced vaccination plans in the region. The country has also reported the second-highest number of virus infections and deaths in Africa, after South Africa. The Moroccan health minister said the government’s target is vaccinating 25 million of the country’s 36 million people, all free of charge, according to orders from King Mohammed VI. While the Moroccan government has been promising vaccinations since earlier this month, the minister said preparations have now reached a “very advanced” stage. He said authorities were carrying out simulations at all the immunization sites “to avoid any obstacles that may arise during the implementation of the vaccination program.” In a first phase, the vaccine will be administered to medical personnel, public authorities, security services, education workers and people suffering from chronic diseases. The Ministry of Health said it has deployed a computerized system to register the target population and track their health status after they receive the vaccine. Moulay said Morocco has sought to diversify supply by signing contracts with multiple countries. Morocco has said it will start its vaccination program with the Sinopharm vaccine, though it hasn’t yet completed advanced trials to prove that it’s safe and effective. The vaccine, which was tested on 600 Moroccans as part of clinical trials this autumn, has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in multiple countries. Morocco’s initial vaccine deliveries will come from China, but Morocco also plans to produce the vaccine locally. The AstraZeneca vaccine is still in advanced trials in countries including Britain and the U.S. and hasn’t been approved yet. Morocco’s daily virus case count has fallen slightly in the last two weeks, but a dip in testing is raising concerns that the virus could be spreading faster than reported. As a preventive measure to curb the spread of the virus during New Year’s celebrations, authorities banned public and private gatherings, closed restaurants in the country’s main cities, and imposed a curfew that went into effect Wednesday night and is set to last for three weeks.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104044", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Lyubov Sobol, a key figure in Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained for 48 hours after a day of interrogation on charges of violent trespassing. The move followed Sobol’s attempt on Monday to enter the Moscow apartment of the alleged operative, whom Navalny had previously duped into describing details of the alleged poisoning.  Sobol has denied the accusations and insisted that she violated no law by ringing the doorbell to the apartment. While Sobol was being questioned, the state Investigative Committee issued a statement accusing her of trespassing — charges her colleagues have rejected. Earlier this week, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he identified as Konstantin Kudryavtsev and described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him with the Soviet-era Novichok agent in August and then tried to cover it up. Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned. In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake.

He also said they were in good position in the first two days of the pink-ball Test. “We had two good days but had just one bad hour where we lost completely. The talk in the dressing room was about backing ourselves as an individual and as a team and stick to the plan whatever it is,” he added on the eve of the second Test. However, Kohli’s departure weakened the Indian batting a bit in trouble and Rahane conceded that they would miss their skipper. There were suggestions to promote himself to No.4 but the middle-order batsman said they have not decided anything yet. “Openers role is crucial but I don’t want to put pressure on them. Just want to give them freedom to play. We will definitely miss Virat. When you have a player like him, it is great for the team.” \nIndia looked in a good position with Kohli and Rahane batting well in the first innings before Kohli was run out. Speaking about the incident, he revealed the momentum shifted in hosts’ favour. “It was a tough one. We were going really well. I saw the momentum going in Australia’s way after the run out. After the end of play, I said sorry to him (Kohli) and he was ok with it. He understood the situation. Such things happen and you have to respect that and move forward.” He further informed that Kohli had a message for the team before heading to India. “He spoke to all of us before leaving. We had a team dinner in Adelaide. He spoke about playing to our strength. We have been playing well. We have to help each other and enjoy each other’s success.” The bowling department will be without Mohammad Shami, who was injured and ruled out of the remainder of the series but the 32-year-old said they are capable of delivering the goods. “Bumrah is a quality bowler and he has been doing really well. Apart from that, Umesh (Yadav) and a guy who will play (Mohammad Siraj), it is about bowling in partnerships. We have discussed how to go about it. It is about bowling in partnerships and bowling towards the plan.” When asked about Australia coach Justin Langer’s comments where he said Indians were under stress after the loss, Rahane added, “Australians are very good at playing mind games. Let them do that. We are focusing on ourselves on what we need to do. We will back ourselves and be positive,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

This is the question that many people are asking… while several sectors including automobile, real estate, financial services - non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in particular, and manufacturing have shown signs of impact from this economic slowdown. The start-up ecosystem seems to be holding up the jury is still out on this as these are still early days. In the last few years several start-ups have raised millions. While the valuations game is still not fully understood,and funding continues to be a double-edged sword. While funding is crucial for all types of companies, a well-funded company can create immense value and disrupt markets, mismanagement of funds or over funding can be a recipe for disaster. The Indian start-up environment is highly unforgiving. Failures are not celebrated but looked down on so a failed enterprise entrepreneur will find it difficult to regain investor confidence. Entrepreneurs sometimes lack the understanding as to if he needs to expose himself to fresh funding and what needs to be done. There is a need for start-ups to get access to a good mentor or advisor. Operating in this very environment is what Radar India Advisors does. Radar India Advisors was founded with the objective to be an advisor to these start-ups and also help them with access to funds. Set up in 2017, Radar India Advisors is an entrepreneur led outfit built to empower and engage entrepreneurs in their various stages of growth. The management of Radar has built and exited 3 different businesses themselves which helps the sensitise first time and even veteran entrepreneurs. In the last 2 years, the investments in start-ups advised by Radar has grown 10 times. Some of the start-ups managed by Radar include Smartivity, Avishkar Box, Coffee bond, Clevergene Biocorp and Pikapika. In the case of Smartivity and Avishkar Box, has worked closely right from the seed stage funding. Radar facilitated an early stage investment of Rs 60 lakhs from S Chand group into Smartivity. Today, Smartivity has raised a total of 22 crores is currently valued at 100 cr that’s a jump in valuation from 2 cr to 100 cr in 4 years. The revenues of Smartivity stand at Rs 20 cr. Similarly, Radar India Advisors was instrumental in facilitating a Pre-Series A funding of Rs 5 crore into Avishkar Box from Auxano Trust, their revenues stand at 18crore a jump of 800% from the initial 2cr. They are currently valued at 100cr. In the case of Coffee Bond, Radar facilitated a “Pre Series A” funding of Rs 1.5 crore from Auxano Trust in January 2019- revenue jump from Rs 80 Lakhs annually to Rs 3.23 crores in one year and their footprint has grown from one cafe outlet to 13 outlets of sale.  Clevergene Biocorp another company advised by Radar is in the process of closing a Pre-Series A funding from Auxano Trust and has seen a revenue jump from 2 crore to 6 crore(expected for FY 2019-20). PikaPika a kids app to censor content on phone for kids is another client for whom Radar has raised Rs 1 crore from Auxano trust in October and they have seen a big spike in users.  Speaking on the success that Radar has had so far Rahul Gupta CEO, Radar India Advisors Said, “It is important that when working with any start-up, it is critical that we understand what to look for I believe there are six main points that we need to look at, number one is to look for the right fight entrepreneur in diverse industries. People who understand their business and the environment they operate in. Number two is to build a personal touch with the entrepreneurs. Number three is to put your money where your mouth is or to invest into the client yourself. Number four is to look for businesses who are solution providers and not valuation hunters. And finally, we try and give PE level advisory to startups. In terms of investors we work with a host of family offices as well as big business houses like S Chand and Auxano trust, here the key is to Giving investors a sector agnostic approach and a wide range of businesses to invest in.” Radar India Advisors has been steadily adding to its portfolio and is currently advising the Made Easy group on strategy and investment in start-ups.

The white whale found frolicking in the frigid harbor of Tufjord, a hamlet near Norway's northernmost point, has become \"a huge attraction\" for locals, one resident said Tuesday.  \n     The whale is so comfortable with people that it swims to the dock and retrieves plastic rings thrown into the sea. \n\n    \n           \"The whale is so tame that when you call it, it comes to you,\" said Linn Saether, adding the whale also reacts to yells and when humans splash their hands in the water. \n  \n  \n\n \n She said when she throws out a plastic ring, the Beluga whale brings it back to her as she sits on the dock. \"It is a fantastic experience, but we also see it as a tragedy. We can see that it has been trained to bring back stuff that is thrown at sea,\" Saether, 37, told The Associated Press. The hamlet has a dozen permanent residents and less than 100 people in the warmer season. The harness was removed from the animal by a team from the Norwegian Director of Fisheries. Jørgen Ree Wiig, from the agency, sent CBS News images and video of the whale and the harness, which has a logo on it reading, \"Equipment of St. Petersburg.\"  \n     \"The talk in this hamlet is that it could have escaped from a Russian military facility or even have swam from St. Petersburg, Florida, because of the English-language text,\" Saether said. It was not immediately known whether any of the dolphin and whale facilities in St. Petersburg, Florida, were missing a Beluga whale. On Friday, a fisherman jumped into the frigid Arctic water to remove the harness, which has a mount for a camera, from the whale.  It wasn't clear why the strap was attached to the mammal. \n\n    \n           Audun Rikardsen, a professor at the Department of Arctic and Marine Biology at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsoe, northern Norway, said he believes \"it is most likely that Russian Navy in Murmansk\" was involved. Murmansk is the headquarters for Russia's Northern Fleet, the single most powerful fleet in the Russian navy. The city is located on the Kola Peninsula, in far northwestern Russia close to the Norwegian border. Russian authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the whale. Russia's military has a history of trying to weaponize whales and other sea mammals. \n     The Cold War-era Soviet Union had a program to train seals, dolphins and other animals to help detect underwater weapons and alert their military trainers. That program ran until the 1990s officially, but it is unclear whether it has ever been shut down or just changed. In 2017, Russia's TV Zvezda, which is owned by the defense ministry in Moscow, aired a report on a Russian navy program to train beluga whales, seals and dolphins for similar purposes. But Mikhail Barabanov, a Russian naval analyst at the Moscow-based Center for the Analysis of Strategies and Technologies think tank, downplayed any links to the Russian military. \"Even if there are military programs for using marine animals for navy purposes, they are unlikely to be belugas, and such animals are unlikely to be released into the open ocean,\" he told AP in an email. \"I think that these Norwegian idiots simply robbed certain Petersburg zoologists\" who were trying to track whales, Barabanov said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/8f73f12f-d75e-423c-9bd2-d226a5ef576a/thumbnail/620x827/bf3efdabf6e129e9678c9aa7f6884ebe/whale-ap-19120539065132.jpg#\" alt=\"Norway Beluga Whale \" height=\"827\" width=\"620\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/8f73f12f-d75e-423c-9bd2-d226a5ef576a/thumbnail/620x827/bf3efdabf6e129e9678c9aa7f6884ebe/whale-ap-19120539065132.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/30/8f73f12f-d75e-423c-9bd2-d226a5ef576a/thumbnail/1240x1654/b76846819f08f5e30a04174b1f241079/whale-ap-19120539065132.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104044", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The typical Hyderabadi dialect commonly used in Irani hotels, play fields or among teammates brought smiles among the citizens from the land of the Musi. The conversation went somewhere on these lines: Sridhar: Aaj shaam mein mere saath hain Mohammed Siraj joh hamara Hyderabad ke ek dam ustad fast bowler pehle Test match MCG Boxing Day Test mei. VVS Laxman ke baad tum pehle Hyderbadi ho jo Hyderabad mein paida hua aur India ko debut kiya. Aap ka aaj kya maholl thaa aur kya lagrah thaa? (Today we have Hyderabad ustad and Hyderabad fast bowler. That too on Boxing Day at MCG. After Laxman you are the born and brought up in Hyderabad to make debut for India. How is the atmosphere and how are you feeling?) Siraj replies: Mero Ko tho bahut hi acha lag rah thaa. Jaise ground mein utra aur jaise cap milee debut mein matlab sabse life mein bada achievement tha. Aur jaise mein ground mein utra, lunch tak ball nahi milee aur jaise drinks hua uske baad bowlers ne bahut acha kiye aur mere koh bhi Ajju bhai mujhse baat kar ke confident deh rahe the ke acha laaga aur mere baaju mein Jesse bhai the confident deh reh the. (I am feeling very happy. As soon as I entered the ground and when I made my debut it was my life’s biggest achievement. I entered the ground but I didn’t get bowling till lunch. The bowlers bowled beautifully. Ajju bhai (Ajinkya Rahane) gave me confident and so was Jesse) Sridhar: Doosra sawal yeh pooch na tha, lunch tak ball nahi haath laga toh dimag mein kya chaal rah tha? Haatha khujara thaa kya?(Second question, till lunch you couldn’t get the ball. What was going through your mind and were your hands itching?) Suraj: Haatha tho khujara rah thaa. Ajju bhai bolre the ki end mein aana. Uske ke baad bolthe toh aur warm up kiya. Mein bhi socha thaa theek hai wicket mein moisture hoga tho spinner ko helpful hain. Uske baad mein mai socha thaa run out mein kuch contribution karunga and confident bhi thaa. Uske lunch ke baad aya tho mera ek plan tha tho dot ball jaada dalun aur pressure build karoon kyun ki uske baad pressure mein wicket mileage (My hands were itching. Ajju bhai told me I would come from this end and I was warming up. I thought I would contribute by making a run out. After lunch, I had a plan to bowl dot balls and build pressure and then get wicket). Sridhar: Aacha yeh pahle batao mujhe pehle cheh ball swing nahi hoh raha thaa uske baad doosra spell aap dono taraf idhar udhar swing kar reh the. Kya toh bhi woh kissa? (You didn’t swing the first six balls but in the second spell you could swing the ball both ways. What was this about?) Siraj: Woh toh natural hai sir. Mein yeh try kar rah tha ki matlab thoda close stumps aah raa thaa and uske baad mein wide off stumps daal raa tha. Mera angle natural in swing tha and aur bhi swing hoh raha tha. (It is natural for me sir. I was bowling close to the stumps and then bowled outside the off stump. I have natural in swing) Sridhar: Cameron Green ko zabardast set kiye aur uske baad zabardast catchaan pakde outfield mein? (You set up Green nicely and took fine catches in the outfield) Siraj: Cameron ghiri tika tho jab mera bahar bhi acha aur andar bhi acha aah rah thaa. . Usko andhar andhar dala thaa uske baad do over usko bahar dala but eek dum eek ball andhar daala thaa. Bahut acha laga set kar ke. Jaisa fielding ki tension nahi thi woh yeh cheez ki. (I was bowling outswingers and I bowled with inswingers but I brought one in nicely. There was no tension while fielding). The Hyderabadi lingo brought memories to many past cricketers. Former fast bowler Rajesh Yadav and former wicketkeeper Youraj Singh said it was always fun when we talk in Hyderabad dialect. Words like haule, chillar kahin, dimagh hi nah hai, bewakoof. P Harimohan, echoed the same feeling. “The lingo is so unique that whoever hears it can’t help laughing. It’s so typical of our happy go lucky culture.’ Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

I got a phone call from the President of Kenya.” Starting at 8:15 a.m., Kipchoge was supported by 36 pacemakers who accompanied him in alternating groups, one of the reasons the IAAF governing body will not ratify the time as a world record. The groups were also helped by a pace car with a laser beam, projecting the ideal position on the road, and they received drinks handed over by cyclists and other runners to prevent them from having to slow down. “It is a great feeling to make history in sport after Sir Roger Bannister,” Kipchoge said in reference to the late Briton’s first sub four-minute mile in 1954. “I am the happiest man in the world to be the first human to run under two hours and I can tell people that no human is limited. I expect more people all over the world to run under two hours after today.” Kipchoge pointed out his mission went beyond athletics. “We can make this world a beautiful world and a peaceful world,” he said. “The positivity of sport. I want to make it a clean sport and an interesting sport.” Kipchoge was cheered by spectators along the course in Prater Park and there were celebrations in his home country before he had even finished. “Hearty congratulations, Eliud Kipchoge,” President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a statement. “You’ve done it, you’ve made history and made Kenya proud. Your win today will inspire future generations to dream big and aspire to greatness. We celebrate you and wish you God’s blessings.” Hundreds of joyous Kenyans brought traffic to a standstill in the middle of the capital, Nairobi, as they gathered to watch the end of the run on a large screen. People pumped their fists, clapped and fell to their knees as Kipchoge cruised to the finish line. In Kenya’s running mecca of Eldoret, called the home of champions, hundreds of people burst on to the streets in celebration. “We should line up the entire road from the airport to Nairobi. Receive him like the hero he is,” prominent activist Boniface Mwangi said on Twitter. Running at an average pace of 2:50 minutes per kilometer (4:33.5 minutes per mile), Kipchoge was 11 seconds ahead of schedule halfway through his run. He then maintained his tempo until the pacemakers left him for the final 500 meters, where he sped up. “I was really calm, I was just trying to maintain the pace,” said Kipchoge, adding he was never in doubt about breaking the barrier. “For me it was not 50-50, it was 90 percent.” Jim Ratcliffe, founder of the chemicals company backing the attempt, exchanged high-fives with Kipchoge after the finish. “He even accelerated in the final kilometer, he is a super human,” Ratcliffe said. “I can’t believe he’s done it. He did the first half in less than an hour and then he’s just done that again.” Organizers said normal anti-doping regulations were in place and that Kipchoge and all the pacemakers were being tested in and out of competition by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). The team behind the event “has ensured all athletes involved in the project are undergoing extensive intelligence-led testing that has been pioneered by the partnership between Abbott World Marathon Majors and the AIU,” they said in a statement to The Associated Press. The Prater Park in the Austrian capital offered long straights, protected from the wind by high trees, for most of the 9.6-kilometer course, which Kipchoge completed more than 4 times. It was his second attempt at breaking the two-hour barrier, after missing out by 26 seconds at a similar event on the Formula One track in Monza, Italy, in May 2017. Kipchoge, who took Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and has won 10 of his 11 marathons, holds the official world record of 2:01:39 since shattering the previous best mark by 78 seconds in Berlin last year. In near-perfect circumstances at the meticulously planned attempt, Kipchoge shaved almost two minutes off that time. Long-time coach and mentor, Patrick Sang, a former Olympic and world steeplechase silver medalist, said it was “really exciting.” “I am happy for him and what he has achieved. He has inspired all of us that we can stretch our limits and that we can do more than we think we can do,” Sang added. Under Sang’s guidance, Kipchoge won gold in the 5,000 meters at the world championship in 2003, the start of a distinguished track career which includes Olympic bronze and silver medals from 2004 and 2008. After missing out on qualification for the 2012 London Olympics on the track, Kipchoge switched to the marathon and has since been pushing the boundaries of the discipline.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104046", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the question that many people are asking… while several sectors including automobile, real estate, financial services - non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in particular, and manufacturing have shown signs of impact from this economic slowdown. The start-up ecosystem seems to be holding up the jury is still out on this as these are still early days. In the last few years several start-ups have raised millions. While the valuations game is still not fully understood,and funding continues to be a double-edged sword. While funding is crucial for all types of companies, a well-funded company can create immense value and disrupt markets, mismanagement of funds or over funding can be a recipe for disaster. The Indian start-up environment is highly unforgiving. Failures are not celebrated but looked down on so a failed enterprise entrepreneur will find it difficult to regain investor confidence. Entrepreneurs sometimes lack the understanding as to if he needs to expose himself to fresh funding and what needs to be done. There is a need for start-ups to get access to a good mentor or advisor. Operating in this very environment is what Radar India Advisors does. Radar India Advisors was founded with the objective to be an advisor to these start-ups and also help them with access to funds. Set up in 2017, Radar India Advisors is an entrepreneur led outfit built to empower and engage entrepreneurs in their various stages of growth. The management of Radar has built and exited 3 different businesses themselves which helps the sensitise first time and even veteran entrepreneurs. In the last 2 years, the investments in start-ups advised by Radar has grown 10 times. Some of the start-ups managed by Radar include Smartivity, Avishkar Box, Coffee bond, Clevergene Biocorp and Pikapika. In the case of Smartivity and Avishkar Box, has worked closely right from the seed stage funding. Radar facilitated an early stage investment of Rs 60 lakhs from S Chand group into Smartivity. Today, Smartivity has raised a total of 22 crores is currently valued at 100 cr that’s a jump in valuation from 2 cr to 100 cr in 4 years. The revenues of Smartivity stand at Rs 20 cr. Similarly, Radar India Advisors was instrumental in facilitating a Pre-Series A funding of Rs 5 crore into Avishkar Box from Auxano Trust, their revenues stand at 18crore a jump of 800% from the initial 2cr. They are currently valued at 100cr. In the case of Coffee Bond, Radar facilitated a “Pre Series A” funding of Rs 1.5 crore from Auxano Trust in January 2019- revenue jump from Rs 80 Lakhs annually to Rs 3.23 crores in one year and their footprint has grown from one cafe outlet to 13 outlets of sale.  Clevergene Biocorp another company advised by Radar is in the process of closing a Pre-Series A funding from Auxano Trust and has seen a revenue jump from 2 crore to 6 crore(expected for FY 2019-20). PikaPika a kids app to censor content on phone for kids is another client for whom Radar has raised Rs 1 crore from Auxano trust in October and they have seen a big spike in users.  Speaking on the success that Radar has had so far Rahul Gupta CEO, Radar India Advisors Said, “It is important that when working with any start-up, it is critical that we understand what to look for I believe there are six main points that we need to look at, number one is to look for the right fight entrepreneur in diverse industries. People who understand their business and the environment they operate in. Number two is to build a personal touch with the entrepreneurs. Number three is to put your money where your mouth is or to invest into the client yourself. Number four is to look for businesses who are solution providers and not valuation hunters. And finally, we try and give PE level advisory to startups. In terms of investors we work with a host of family offices as well as big business houses like S Chand and Auxano trust, here the key is to Giving investors a sector agnostic approach and a wide range of businesses to invest in.” Radar India Advisors has been steadily adding to its portfolio and is currently advising the Made Easy group on strategy and investment in start-ups.

Mozambique's National Institute for Disaster Management said the death toll from the storm that slammed into the country at the end of last week had risen to 38. \n     With the floodwaters still rising and more torrential rain forecast for the days ahead, the disaster agency said an estimated 168,000 people were at risk. The new figures were announced as the ongoing heavy rains hampered efforts to deliver food and shelter to badly hit communities.   \n  \n  \n\n \n The heavy rains caused deadly mudslides in Pemba, the region's main city.

Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said the current slowdown in exports is mainly due to a decline in petroleum products, which constitute 13.42 per cent of overall outward shipments. This decline, he said, is mainly on account of fall in petroleum prices which has driven the export value downwards. However, \"the positive growth in the exports of non-conventional commodity groups like electronic goods, drugs, and pharmaceuticals, organic and inorganic chemicals, augurs well for future growth,\" he told PTI. India's export growth is in the negative zone since August 2019 due to a steep fall in shipments of key sectors like petroleum, engineering and gems and jewellery. Labour-intensive sectors such as carpets, ready-made garments, handloom and leather too are recording decline in export growth. As per the World Trade Organization (WTO), global merchandise trade volumes are expected to rise by only 1.2 per cent in 2019, substantially slower than the 2.6 per cent growth forecast in April 2019. However in 2020, the growth in trade volume is projected to accelerate to 2.7 per cent. Apex exporters body Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said the global situation is becoming extremely challenging as rising protectionism is leading to uncertainty. FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai said the global situation is likely to improve in the first half of 2020, which would have a positive impact on India's exports. \"If the global situation improves, which is likely in the first half of 2020, we may look for 15 per cent growth in exports in the next financial year (2020-21). Exports will come out of negative zone next year but the rate of growth will not be in double digits,\" he said. He added that the order book position of Indian exporters is encouraging and less volatility in the domestic currency has also been a positive factor for traders. Sahai also said that Indian exports have to be aligned with changing import patterns of the global economy as 50 per cent of the world imports today is accounted by electrical and electronics products, automobiles, machinery, petroleum products and plastic items. \"While employment-intensive sectors should be pushed in exports, the new strategy should focus on technology-driven sectors,\" he said. Sharing similar views, Professor Rakesh Mohan Joshi from the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT) said the steps taken by the government would help exports record growth in 2020. \"There is a need to take structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of Indian products in the global markets,\" Joshi said. The commerce ministry is considering several steps such as the announcement of the new WTO-compliant export incentive scheme and the new foreign trade policy for the next five years in 2020 to push the country's exports. The ministry has conducted a series of meetings with concerned stakeholders to finalise the foreign trade policy. On the trade front, India has been negotiating the mega free trade agreement RCEP  (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) since 2013. But in November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will not join the RCEP deal as negotiations failed to satisfactorily address New Delhi's \"outstanding issues and concerns\". Since January this year, exports have recorded a low rate of growth and slipped into the negative zone in August. During April-November 2019-20, the country's exports contracted by 2 per cent to USD 212 billion. Going by the current trend, FIEO has estimated that the exports may stand at USD 330-340 billion in the current fiscal. In 2018-19, the exports grew by 9 per cent to USD 331 billion from USD 303.5 billion in 2017-18. Since 2011-12, India's exports have been hovering at around USD 300 billion. Promoting exports helps a country to create jobs, boost manufacturing and earn more foreign exchange.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104047", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

He had a dream that Siraj would play for India in Test cricket. Within a month of his death, my brother has got that god-sent opportunity. It is one of the best news in recent times,’’ brother Ismail, a software Engineer, said from their Toli Chowki residence after hearing that his brother Mohd Siraj will make his Test debut against Australia in Melbourne on Saturday. Ghouse had passed away on November 19. “It was one of the biggest losses for our family. Siraj was inconsolable when he heard that `Abba jaan’ had died. We had great difficulty in controlling his emotions from here to Australia. He was very low in confidence and contemplated at one point even coming back to India. Luckily the Indian team members, particularly Virat Kohli and Ravi Shastri, played a big role in consoling him,’’ added Ismail. Ismail pointed out: “My father would always say to Siraj make India proud. Desh Ko Roshan Karo. He always had a proud feeling whenever Siraj played for India. There was always a big smile on his face and sense of satisfaction whenever Siraj donned the Indian colours.’’ From the quaint lanes of Khaja Nagar in Banjara Hills, 26-year-old Siraj has fulfilled his father’s dreams. “We came through a lot of hardships. Being an autorickshaw driver, my father and mother Shabana Begum did all sundry works. I was studious while Siraj was always busy playing cricket in the small lanes. My mother was often upset because Siraj never focused his attention on studies. She would often beat him saying that he is wasting his career by playing the game. “But my father always supported Siraj. He would quietly slip in money in Siraj’s pocket and encouraged him to play cricket. Siraj was very passionate about the game and fast bowling. Today, we are all happy that he is going to play for India in Test cricket, that too at the magnificent MCG ground. He would be having my father’s blessings from heaven. It is a big moment for our family,’’ said Ismail, who had passed his engineering in 2014 and now acts as a manager for his brother. Siraj had moved to Toli Chowki where he could give best comforts to his parents. “We have not sold our father’s auto. He proudly travelled in Jeep Compass in the last few years.’’ Former chairman of National selection Committee MSK Prasad said he always believed Siraj had the potential to play for India. “He is one of the successful cricketers in India A matches. He has taken six or more five-wicket hauls that too against big teams. We thought he was a very good red-ball cricket as he could move the late and was a work-horse.’’ P Jyothi Prasad, who was the chairman of the Hyderabad selection committee when Siraj made his Ranji debut in 2014-15 season, said this Hyderabad fast bowler always excited him. “He had the hunger to excel in big stage.’’ Siraj will be the second Hyderabad fast bowler after Syed Abid Ali, who incidentally made his Test debut against Australia in Adelaide way back in 1966, to play for India in Test cricket. Former Hyderabad opener Abdul Azeem, who was instrumental in shaping Siraj’s career when he gave him cricket shoes etc, said God is great. “I have seen the hardships the family went through.

Store shelves were bare after people stocked up on water and food ahead of Typhoon Hagibis. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of dangerously heavy rainfall in Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, including Gunma, Saitama and Kanagawa, and later expanded the area to include Fukushima and Miyagi to the north. A coastal earthquake also rattled the area. “Be ready for rainfall of the kind that you have never experienced,” said meteorological agency official Yasushi Kajihara, adding that areas usually safe from disasters may prove vulnerable. “Take all measures necessary to save your life,” he said. Kajihara said people who live near rivers should take shelter on the second floor or higher of any sturdy building if an officially designated evacuation center wasn’t easily accessible. Hagibis, which means “speed” in Filipino, was advancing north-northwestward with maximum sustained winds of 144 kilometers (90 miles) per hour, according to the meteorological agency. It was traveling northward at a speed of 40 kph (25 mph). It reached Kawasaki, a western part of greater Tokyo, late Saturday and headed to Tsukuba city to the north about an hour later, before it was expected to swerve toward the sea, the agency said. The storm brought heavy rainfall in wide areas of Japan all day ahead of its landfall, including in Shizuoka and Mie prefectures, southwest of Tokyo, as well as Chiba to the north, which saw power outages and damaged homes in a typhoon last month. Under gloomy skies, a tornado ripped through Chiba on Saturday, overturning a car in the city of Ichihara and killing a man inside the vehicle, city official Tatsuya Sakamaki said. Five people were injured when the tornado ripped through a house. Their injuries were not life-threatening, Sakamaki said. The heavy rain caused rivers to swell, and several had flooded by late Saturday. The wind flipped anchored boats and whipped up sea waters in a dangerous surge along the coast and areas near rivers, flooding some residential neighborhoods and leaving people to wade in ankle-deep waters and cars floating. Some roads were so flooded they looked like muddy ditches. An earthquake shook the area drenched by the rainfall shortly before the typhoon made landfall in Shizuoka prefecture Saturday evening. but there were no immediate reports of damage. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 5.3 quake was centered in the ocean off the coast of Chiba, near Tokyo, and was fairly deep, at 59.5 kilometers (37 miles). Deep quakes tend to cause less damage than shallow ones. In Shizuoka, one of two men who went missing in the Nishikawa River was rescued, Gotemba city official Fumihiko Katsumata said. Firefighters said the two men were working at a river canal to try to control overflowing when they were swept away. The nationally circulated Yomiuri newspaper put the storm’s casualty toll at two people dead, three missing and 62 injured. More than 170,000 people had evacuated, the paper said. More than 370,000 homes suffered power outages as a result of the typhoon, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co. Yusuke Ikegaya, a Shizuoka resident who evacuated ahead of the storm, said he was surprised that the nearby river was about to overflow in the morning, hours before the typhoon made landfall. “In the 28 years of my life, this is the first time I’ve had to evacuate even before a typhoon has landed,” he said. Authorities also warned of mudslides, common in mountainous Japan. Two dams began to release some of their waters and other dams in the area may take similar measures, as waters were nearing limits, public broadcaster NHK reported. An overflooded dam is likely to cause greater damage, and so releasing some water gradually is a standard emergency measure, but the released water added to the heavy rainfall could be dangerous, causing rivers to flood. Rugby World Cup matches, concerts and other events in the typhoon’s path were canceled, while flights were grounded and train services halted. Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier in the week, including urging people to stay indoors. Some 17,000 police and military troops were called up, standing ready for rescue operations. Residents taped up their apartment windows to prevent them from shattering. TV talks shows showed footage of household items like a slipper bashing through glass when hurled by winds. Evacuation centers were set up in coastal towns, and people rested on gymnasium floors, saying they hoped their homes were still there after the storm passed.

Does lying matter anymore?  Honesty has always been considered a keystone of character. Even children know lying is wrong. This is clearly communicated in our faith traditions as well.  For example, the Bible warns against some form of lying  . It's right there in the 10 commandments -- \"Thou shall not bear false witness against your neighbor\" and echoed from the Old Testament (\"A righteous man hateth lying...\" Proverbs 13:5)  to the New Testament (\"Do not lie to one another...' Colossians 3:9-10).  Whether lying matters is, of course, not an idle question. A core component of President Donald Trump's coalition is evangelical Christians -- people who have righteously railed against a lack of character and ethics in the White House in the past and advocated for a return to family values. This presumably does not include lying. But the fact is that conservative Christian voters supported Donald Trump in 2016  than they did George W. Bush, a born-again Christian whose faith shaped his \"compassionate conservative\" politics.  Few would use the same phrase to describe Trump, who commands evangelical respect, even though the respect is  .

At the same time, many of Joe Biden's backers are nervously eying his lead in key swing state polls, worried it won't endure for the next nine days. But it's not 2016 anymore. So much has changed in four years: Trump is no longer the new disrupter, he's a president trailing multiple incendiary controversies as he seeks four more years.

Wade is not good, settled law -- even though she told the Judiciary Committee another story.  Most revealingly, she co-wrote   article suggesting that Catholic judges are not able to fairly decide death penalty cases that conflict with their religious beliefs and should therefore recuse themselves in some cases -- which raises a number of troubling questions (that were   by her during her confirmation) about potential cases involving abortion, contraception or LGBTQ rights, which are   the Catholic Church  . \"Catholic judges (if they are faithful to the teaching of their church) are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty,\" Barrett wrote. Catholic judges, the article says, must abide by their oath of office, but also by the church's moral teachings. And tellingly, Barrett argues that the church's moral teachings on abortion are even stricter than those on the death penalty: \"The prohibitions against abortion and euthanasia (properly defined) are absolute; those against war and capital punishment are not.\" She has said since her nomination that judges are not policymakers and must set aside their own policy views. Yet  .   I'll be honest: I hope Barrett will exercise her moral compass on the Supreme Court when it comes to capital cases. The death penalty is a moral outrage, and the fact that America executes so many of its citizens should be a deep shame on our nation.

Richard Lugar, a Republican foreign policy sage known for leading efforts to help the former Soviet states dismantle and secure much of their nuclear arsenal, but whose reputation for working with Democrats cost him his final campaign, died Sunday. He was 87. \n     The Lugar Center   saying Lugar died early Sunday at the Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute in Virginia from complications related to chronic inflammatory demylinating polyneuropathy, or CIPD, a rare neurological disorder. A soft-spoken and thoughtful former Rhodes Scholar, Lugar dominated Indiana politics during his 36 years in the U.S. Senate. That popularity gave him the freedom to concentrate largely on foreign policy and national security matters — a focus highlighted by his collaboration with Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn on a program under which the U.S. paid to dismantle and secure thousands of nuclear warheads and missiles in the former Soviet states after the Cold War ended. \n\n    \n           \"Every stockpile represents a theft opportunity for terrorists and a temptation for security personnel who might seek to profit by selling weapons on the black market,\" Lugar said in 2005. \"We do not want the question posed the day after an attack on an American military base.\" \n  \n  \n\n \n He served for decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, twice as chairman, where he helped steer arms reduction pacts for the presidential administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, supported an expansion of NATO and favored aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels. Lugar tried to translate his foreign policy expertise into a 1996 presidential run, where his slogan was \"nuclear security and fiscal sanity.\" But his campaign for the GOP nomination went badly from the start. His kickoff rally began just hours after the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, and he struggled to build name recognition and support. \"He is not, nor does he try to be, a good ol' boy,\" Rex Early, a former state Republican chairman who worked on many of Lugar's campaigns, said during the presidential run. \"He is not a back-pounder and doesn't tell funny jokes and have a beer with the boys.\" Lugar tried to counter questions about his demeanor, contending that the presidency is \"serious business. The presidency is not entertainment.\" But he was chafed at criticism that he was too straight, too smart, too dull. \n     \"I don't know what that means,\" he said. \"Is it better to have someone stupid? Or mediocre? Or halfway there?\" He withdrew a year into the race after failing to win a single convention delegate, but not before eerily foreshadowing the threat of terrorism that would become all too real on Sept. 11, 2001. Three of his television ads depicted mushroom clouds and warned of the growing danger of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorist groups. Lugar's time as a Washington foreign policy expert was the highlight of a political career that began with his   to the Indianapolis school board in the early 1960s. It was there that he caught the eye of city GOP leaders, who encouraged him to run for mayor in 1967. He served two terms at the city's helm, leading the unification of Indianapolis and its suburban communities in Marion County, which solidified the city's tax base and added so many Republican voters that Democrats weren't able to win the mayor's office again for more than 30 years. He also started efforts to revive the city's downtown with construction of Market Square Arena, which in turn helped bring the Indiana Pacers into the NBA and spurred Indianapolis' development as a sports city that culminated in the 2011 Super Bowl. As mayor, he was referred to as \"Richard Nixon's favorite mayor\" for backing the move of federal programs to local governments. He first ran for Senate in 1974, but lost narrowly to Sen. Birch Bayh in the Democratic landslide at the time of the Watergate scandal. But he ran again two years later and easily unseated three-term Democratic Sen. Vance Hartke, launching a 35-year Capitol Hill career that made him Indiana's longest-serving senator. He built a reputation as someone willing to work across the aisle and showed he could buck his party, notably with two major disagreements with President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. \n     In 1986, Reagan was inclined to accept the rigged election that would have kept Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in office. But Lugar went to the islands as an election observer and said Reagan was misinformed. Lugar's stand shifted U.S. support to the ultimate winner, Corazon Aquino, bringing down Marcos. In another break with Reagan, Lugar pushed through Congress — over the president's veto — the economic sanctions that Nelson Mandela said played a crucial role in overthrowing white minority rule in South Africa. \n\n    \n           His foreign policy work didn't sit well with everyone. Sen. Jesse Helms ousted him as the top Republican on the foreign relations committee in 1986 as being \"too internationalist.\" But at home, Lugar remained the Indiana GOP's most popular figure, trouncing his opponents by winning at least two-thirds of the vote in four straight elections. Democrats considered him so invincible that they didn't nominate a challenger to him for the 2006 election. He was the top Republican on the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee when he first worked with Obama, taking the then-Illinois senator with him to Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan in 2005 to visit weapon dismantlement sites. He then co-sponsored 2007 legislation with Obama on eliminating stockpiles of shoulder-fired missiles. Obama frequently cited his work with Lugar during the 2008 presidential campaign as evidence of his bipartisanship and foreign policy experience. Lugar endorsed John McCain but didn't distance himself from Obama at the time, saying \"I'm pleased that we had the association that Sen. Obama described.\" That changed by the time of Lugar's 2012 re-election campaign. His tea party-backed challenger, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock, maintained that, \"Lugar has clearly lost his way on issues like our raising the debt limit, wasteful earmark spending and massive bailouts of private companies at taxpayer expense.\" \n     Lugar's campaign ads highlighted his votes against Obama's \"bankrupting\" budgets, and the senator said his relationship with Obama was \"overhyped.\" But those attacks on his conservatism — combined with voter wariness about his age and long Washington tenure and questions about him not owning a home in Indiana since the late 1970s — led to Lugar's first defeat since 1974, as Mourdock grabbed 60 percent of the GOP primary vote. In conceding defeat, Lugar said he knew some of his positions had been considered \"heretical\" by some, including his opposition to earmarks and support for immigration reform. \"I believe that they were the right votes for the country, and I stand by them without regrets,\" he said. After Lugar's defeat, Nunn, the Democratic senator with whom he worked on nuclear disarmament, suggested that many people may have misinterpreted Lugar's positions as they accused him of being too liberal. \"Dick Lugar never compromised his principles in anything we did together, nor did I,\" Nunn said at the time. \"We found ways to work together because we examined the facts and let the facts have a bearing on the conclusions, and I'm afraid in today's political world too often people start with the conclusions and then hunt facts to justify them.\" The Nunn-Lugar program led to about 7,600 Soviet nuclear warheads being deactivated and the destruction of more than 900 intercontinental ballistic missiles by the time Lugar left office, according to U.S. military figures. The program is credited with removing all nuclear weapons from the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus. \n     Born April 4, 1932, in Indianapolis, Lugar became an Eagle Scout and graduated at the top of his classes at both Indianapolis Shortridge High School and at Denison University in Ohio. At Denison, he played cello in the orchestra and was the student body co-president with his future wife, Charlene. They married in 1956 and had four sons. He was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and in 1956 he became a Navy officer, spending time as an intelligence aide for the chief of naval operations. He moved back to Indianapolis in 1960 to help run the family's food machinery manufacturing business. A longtime fitness advocate, he sponsored runs in Indiana and even at age 70 completed a 3-mile competitive race in Washington in just over 28 minutes. Former President Barack Obama issued a statement Sunday afternoon saying \"for 36 years, Richard Lugar proved that pragmatism and decency work — not only in Washington, but all over the world.\" \"He exhibited the truth that common courtesy can speak across cultures,\" Obama continued. \"In Dick, I saw someone who wasn't a Republican or Democrat first, but a problem-solver-an example of the impact a public servant can make by eschewing partisan divisiveness to instead focus on common ground. Today, thousands of warheads, bombers, and submarines no longer threaten us because of Dick's work. America is safer because of Dick; the world is, too. His passing is a reminder of the constant and pressing need to expand international nonproliferation agreements. And it's a call to remember what a public servant can be.\" Vice President   Sunday: \"As the longest serving member of Congress from Indiana, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, he leaves behind a legacy of public service that will inspire Hoosiers for generations.\" \n", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/28/95a005a5-de74-4266-8847-c6390c17bc58/thumbnail/620x413g2/f4678baffd9abc5ce115aac7243d414e/gettyimages-101924333.jpg#\" alt=\"Lugar Introduces New Energy And Climate Change Bill \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/28/95a005a5-de74-4266-8847-c6390c17bc58/thumbnail/620x413g2/f4678baffd9abc5ce115aac7243d414e/gettyimages-101924333.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/28/95a005a5-de74-4266-8847-c6390c17bc58/thumbnail/1240x826g2/4a726ec7fdf6e0926d00fa88415725fb/gettyimages-101924333.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104049", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.mydigitalfc.com", "section": "Just In", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.mydigitalfc.com/companies/281219/delhi-sees-more-night-trips-than-bengaluru-mumbai-says-ola.html", "title": "Delhi sees more night trips than Bengaluru, Mumbai, says Ola", "author": "\n                ", "author_link": "", "published_date": "\n                ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "Overall, Delhi recorded 71 million trips totalling 1.06 billion km in 2019.", "text": " Delhi recorded seven million trips between 10 PM and 6 AM this year - the highest among Bengaluru, Mumbai and other major cities, as per Ola's latest ridership data.

There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue.

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL).

The steep drop in sales caused operational hardships for many companies and production plans had to be re-evaluated through the year. The sector, including dealerships and auto components, witnessed around 3.5 lakh people losing jobs due to the downturn. Despite hard times, all hope is not lost. Industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) expects things to turnaround in 2020-21. \"2020 will be an interesting year with BS-VI getting implemented and entirely new platforms being available in the market,\" SIAM President Rajan Wadhera told PTI. But what gives the industry hope? \"The Indian economy is expected to revive early next year, which along with the low base of last year and availability of newer models should support growth in the auto sector,\" Wadhera said. According to him, the sector is expected to start reviving from the second quarter of the next financial year but it will be visible from the third quarter of the fiscal. \"Implementation of BS-VI norms will mean clearing of all old inventory, building up new inventory and making available new BS-VI compliant vehicles in the market, which will give some upside to the production and sale,\" Wadhera noted. However, with vehicle cost going up by 8-10 per cent due to technology ramp up, industry fears that it could further lead volume loss. \"To get respite from this additional cost pressure, SIAM has submitted to the government to lower GST rate for vehicles to 18 per cent from 28 per cent and also introduce an incentive-based scrappage policy for vehicles,\" Wadhera said. Both these submissions, if implemented, will surely support quicker recovery for the auto sector, he added. Wadhera's optimism is shared by India's largest carmaker MD & CEO, Maruti Suzuki India Limited MD & CEO, Kenichi Ayukawa, who is also \"hopeful that 2020 will be a better year for us and industry and approach it with optimism\". Yet, Ayukawa has a note of caution. \"On way forward, it is really tough to predict the turnaround but the long term story for Indian automobile industry continues to be promising,\" he said. Expressing similar views, Hyundai Motor India MD and CEO S S Kim said,\"Probably after the BS-VI implementation, for few months the customer will need time to understand new norms and new situations. So, I would say demand will grow gradually from the second half of the next year.\" Honda Cars India President and CEO Gaku Nakanishi said that it appeared that the industry has already hit its bottom this year. \"We are not sure of the speed of recovery yet but the situation will improve in next fiscal. After market adjusts in BS-VI regime, we think that industry will gradually start recovering from next festive season,\" he noted. With BS-VI transition being the most immediate challenge, auto manufacturers have put their all as they get ready to be fully compliant by April 1, 2020. \"The investments towards the BS-VI transition has been the single largest investment for Tata Motors. We are ready with our BS-VI transition plan and our new BS-VI products will start rolling out from January 2020,\" Tata Motors CEO and MD Guenter Butschek said. In order to ensure there is no BS-IV stock left after March 31, 2020 automobile companies have already started aligning their productions accordingly. As for new products set to hit the market in 2020, the upcoming Auto Expo from February 5-12 will give a glimpse. \"The Auto Expo 2020 will be the launching pad for the revival of the auto industry, we feel,\" Wadhera said, adding the main attractions of the expo would be clean vehicles, keeping in mind the BS-VI norms besides electric, hybrid and connected vehicles. Tata Motor's Nexon EV and MG Motor's ZS EV are set to hit the roads soon to follow the footsteps of Hyundai's Kona that has already found takers. In all, over 60 new launches and unveilings of vehicles are expected at the expo where China's Great Wall Motor Company and First Automotive Works (FAW) will make their debut along with MG Motors India. Holding the flag up for the industry at the motor show would be the likes of Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, M&M, Tata Motors and Kia along with Skoda and Volkswagen brands, which are making a comeback after skipping the 2018 edition. However, the slowdown witnessed by the auto sector in the past five successive quarters has had an impact on participation. Notable absentees are Honda, Toyota, Ford, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover along two-wheeler majors Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co. The industry, during the current fiscal, witnessed successful debut of Kia Motors and MG Motor with their initial models hitting the bulls eye.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104049", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

After approving Anirudh Singh as chief coach of the Hyderabad senior team four days ago, the HCA did a volte face on Saturday. While announcing the 20-member squad for the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tourney, they named Zakir Hussain as chief coach of the team instead. Both president Mohd Azharuddin and secretary R Vijayanand were not available for comments on the sudden change. No reasons were given by the association on this sudden development. For Anirudh, who is considered a sincere coach, this is yet another blow. He was removed as Under-19 coach last season for reasons best known to the association. Meanwhile, joint secretary Naresh Sharma has strongly objected to the change of chief coach. “We all had agreed for Anirudh Singh as chief coach but the sudden change has surprised me. It gives a wrong signal,” he said. Tanmay Agarwal, despite a poor show as a captain in Ranji Trophy last season, will continue to lead the team while B Sandeep will be his deputy. \nAccording to the secretary’s statement, the team has been asked to meet in the Green Park hotel on Sunday. : Tanmay Agarwal (Captain), Tilak Varma, Abhirath Reddy, Himalay Agarwal, B Sandeep (Vice Captain), Buddhi Rahul, Sai Pragnay Reddy, Kolla Sumanth, CV Milind, T Ravi Teja, Ajay Dev Goud, Yudveer Singh, Tanay Tyagarajan, Mickil Jaiswal, Hitesh Yadav, Rakesh Yadav, Prateek Reddy, Rakshann Readi, Karthikeya Kak, MSR Charan; Stand Byes: Ashish Srivastav, Akash Bhandari, Shreyas Vala, Samhith Reddy; Coach: Zakir Hussain; Asst Coach: Shashank Nag; Physio: Bheeshm Pratap Singh; Trainer: Rajamani; Video Analyst: Sailesh Kumar; \nMassuier: Sajjed Hussain; Manager: Chitti Sridhar.hitti Sridhar.

The Soviets publicly confirmed the accident only after Sweden announced a detected spike in atmospheric radiation.

Within ten days, the leak was more or less controlled.   \n             \n         But the damage had been done.

And if we pick sides, you're going to create the Syrian situation on the ground in Libya. So my advice to the president is push for a political reconciliation in Libya. There is no military solution to Libya. Haftar cannot control the country by military force.\" Haftar, a U.S. citizen and former resident of Virginia, has signaled he might move his troops into Tripoli and take the city by force. Graham urged the president to pursue a \"political solution\" in Libya, warning that an escalation of violence would lead to more refugees fleeing the country.   \"I hope we rebalance that phone call soon,\" he said. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/2dd622f7-57c9-41fe-9154-2211d00515af/thumbnail/140x90/ae81d17980f5739a573170d3ce9d9fac/img-3131.jpg#\" alt=\"Camilo Montoya-Galvez \" height=\"90\" width=\"140\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/2dd622f7-57c9-41fe-9154-2211d00515af/thumbnail/140x90/ae81d17980f5739a573170d3ce9d9fac/img-3131.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/17/2dd622f7-57c9-41fe-9154-2211d00515af/thumbnail/280x180/b4136d1735cc6a3860c6c818c8dbb45b/img-3131.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20140%2090'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104050", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Richard Lugar, a Republican foreign policy sage known for leading efforts to help the former Soviet states dismantle and secure much of their nuclear arsenal, but whose reputation for working with Democrats cost him his final campaign, died Sunday. He was 87. \n     The Lugar Center   saying Lugar died early Sunday at the Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute in Virginia from complications related to chronic inflammatory demylinating polyneuropathy, or CIPD, a rare neurological disorder. A soft-spoken and thoughtful former Rhodes Scholar, Lugar dominated Indiana politics during his 36 years in the U.S. Senate. That popularity gave him the freedom to concentrate largely on foreign policy and national security matters — a focus highlighted by his collaboration with Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn on a program under which the U.S. paid to dismantle and secure thousands of nuclear warheads and missiles in the former Soviet states after the Cold War ended. \n\n    \n           \"Every stockpile represents a theft opportunity for terrorists and a temptation for security personnel who might seek to profit by selling weapons on the black market,\" Lugar said in 2005. \"We do not want the question posed the day after an attack on an American military base.\" \n  \n  \n\n \n He served for decades on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, twice as chairman, where he helped steer arms reduction pacts for the presidential administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, supported an expansion of NATO and favored aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels. Lugar tried to translate his foreign policy expertise into a 1996 presidential run, where his slogan was \"nuclear security and fiscal sanity.\" But his campaign for the GOP nomination went badly from the start. His kickoff rally began just hours after the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building, and he struggled to build name recognition and support. \"He is not, nor does he try to be, a good ol' boy,\" Rex Early, a former state Republican chairman who worked on many of Lugar's campaigns, said during the presidential run. \"He is not a back-pounder and doesn't tell funny jokes and have a beer with the boys.\" Lugar tried to counter questions about his demeanor, contending that the presidency is \"serious business. The presidency is not entertainment.\" But he was chafed at criticism that he was too straight, too smart, too dull. \n     \"I don't know what that means,\" he said. \"Is it better to have someone stupid? Or mediocre? Or halfway there?\" He withdrew a year into the race after failing to win a single convention delegate, but not before eerily foreshadowing the threat of terrorism that would become all too real on Sept. 11, 2001. Three of his television ads depicted mushroom clouds and warned of the growing danger of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorist groups. Lugar's time as a Washington foreign policy expert was the highlight of a political career that began with his   to the Indianapolis school board in the early 1960s. It was there that he caught the eye of city GOP leaders, who encouraged him to run for mayor in 1967. He served two terms at the city's helm, leading the unification of Indianapolis and its suburban communities in Marion County, which solidified the city's tax base and added so many Republican voters that Democrats weren't able to win the mayor's office again for more than 30 years. He also started efforts to revive the city's downtown with construction of Market Square Arena, which in turn helped bring the Indiana Pacers into the NBA and spurred Indianapolis' development as a sports city that culminated in the 2011 Super Bowl. As mayor, he was referred to as \"Richard Nixon's favorite mayor\" for backing the move of federal programs to local governments. He first ran for Senate in 1974, but lost narrowly to Sen. Birch Bayh in the Democratic landslide at the time of the Watergate scandal. But he ran again two years later and easily unseated three-term Democratic Sen. Vance Hartke, launching a 35-year Capitol Hill career that made him Indiana's longest-serving senator. He built a reputation as someone willing to work across the aisle and showed he could buck his party, notably with two major disagreements with President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. \n     In 1986, Reagan was inclined to accept the rigged election that would have kept Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in office. But Lugar went to the islands as an election observer and said Reagan was misinformed. Lugar's stand shifted U.S. support to the ultimate winner, Corazon Aquino, bringing down Marcos. In another break with Reagan, Lugar pushed through Congress — over the president's veto — the economic sanctions that Nelson Mandela said played a crucial role in overthrowing white minority rule in South Africa. \n\n    \n           His foreign policy work didn't sit well with everyone. Sen. Jesse Helms ousted him as the top Republican on the foreign relations committee in 1986 as being \"too internationalist.\" But at home, Lugar remained the Indiana GOP's most popular figure, trouncing his opponents by winning at least two-thirds of the vote in four straight elections. Democrats considered him so invincible that they didn't nominate a challenger to him for the 2006 election. He was the top Republican on the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee when he first worked with Obama, taking the then-Illinois senator with him to Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan in 2005 to visit weapon dismantlement sites. He then co-sponsored 2007 legislation with Obama on eliminating stockpiles of shoulder-fired missiles. Obama frequently cited his work with Lugar during the 2008 presidential campaign as evidence of his bipartisanship and foreign policy experience. Lugar endorsed John McCain but didn't distance himself from Obama at the time, saying \"I'm pleased that we had the association that Sen. Obama described.\" That changed by the time of Lugar's 2012 re-election campaign. His tea party-backed challenger, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock, maintained that, \"Lugar has clearly lost his way on issues like our raising the debt limit, wasteful earmark spending and massive bailouts of private companies at taxpayer expense.\" \n     Lugar's campaign ads highlighted his votes against Obama's \"bankrupting\" budgets, and the senator said his relationship with Obama was \"overhyped.\" But those attacks on his conservatism — combined with voter wariness about his age and long Washington tenure and questions about him not owning a home in Indiana since the late 1970s — led to Lugar's first defeat since 1974, as Mourdock grabbed 60 percent of the GOP primary vote. In conceding defeat, Lugar said he knew some of his positions had been considered \"heretical\" by some, including his opposition to earmarks and support for immigration reform. \"I believe that they were the right votes for the country, and I stand by them without regrets,\" he said. After Lugar's defeat, Nunn, the Democratic senator with whom he worked on nuclear disarmament, suggested that many people may have misinterpreted Lugar's positions as they accused him of being too liberal. \"Dick Lugar never compromised his principles in anything we did together, nor did I,\" Nunn said at the time. \"We found ways to work together because we examined the facts and let the facts have a bearing on the conclusions, and I'm afraid in today's political world too often people start with the conclusions and then hunt facts to justify them.\" The Nunn-Lugar program led to about 7,600 Soviet nuclear warheads being deactivated and the destruction of more than 900 intercontinental ballistic missiles by the time Lugar left office, according to U.S. military figures. The program is credited with removing all nuclear weapons from the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus. \n     Born April 4, 1932, in Indianapolis, Lugar became an Eagle Scout and graduated at the top of his classes at both Indianapolis Shortridge High School and at Denison University in Ohio. At Denison, he played cello in the orchestra and was the student body co-president with his future wife, Charlene. They married in 1956 and had four sons. He was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and in 1956 he became a Navy officer, spending time as an intelligence aide for the chief of naval operations. He moved back to Indianapolis in 1960 to help run the family's food machinery manufacturing business. A longtime fitness advocate, he sponsored runs in Indiana and even at age 70 completed a 3-mile competitive race in Washington in just over 28 minutes. Former President Barack Obama issued a statement Sunday afternoon saying \"for 36 years, Richard Lugar proved that pragmatism and decency work — not only in Washington, but all over the world.\" \"He exhibited the truth that common courtesy can speak across cultures,\" Obama continued. \"In Dick, I saw someone who wasn't a Republican or Democrat first, but a problem-solver-an example of the impact a public servant can make by eschewing partisan divisiveness to instead focus on common ground. Today, thousands of warheads, bombers, and submarines no longer threaten us because of Dick's work. America is safer because of Dick; the world is, too. His passing is a reminder of the constant and pressing need to expand international nonproliferation agreements. And it's a call to remember what a public servant can be.\" Vice President   Sunday: \"As the longest serving member of Congress from Indiana, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, he leaves behind a legacy of public service that will inspire Hoosiers for generations.\" \n", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/28/95a005a5-de74-4266-8847-c6390c17bc58/thumbnail/620x413g2/f4678baffd9abc5ce115aac7243d414e/gettyimages-101924333.jpg#\" alt=\"Lugar Introduces New Energy And Climate Change Bill \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/28/95a005a5-de74-4266-8847-c6390c17bc58/thumbnail/620x413g2/f4678baffd9abc5ce115aac7243d414e/gettyimages-101924333.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/28/95a005a5-de74-4266-8847-c6390c17bc58/thumbnail/1240x826g2/4a726ec7fdf6e0926d00fa88415725fb/gettyimages-101924333.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104050", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.pbs.org", "section": "World", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/december-26-2020-pbs-newshour-weekend-full-episode", "title": "PBS NewsHour full episode", "author": null, "author_link": null, "published_date": "", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104047", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Store shelves were bare after people stocked up on water and food ahead of Typhoon Hagibis. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of dangerously heavy rainfall in Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, including Gunma, Saitama and Kanagawa, and later expanded the area to include Fukushima and Miyagi to the north. A coastal earthquake also rattled the area. “Be ready for rainfall of the kind that you have never experienced,” said meteorological agency official Yasushi Kajihara, adding that areas usually safe from disasters may prove vulnerable. “Take all measures necessary to save your life,” he said. Kajihara said people who live near rivers should take shelter on the second floor or higher of any sturdy building if an officially designated evacuation center wasn’t easily accessible. Hagibis, which means “speed” in Filipino, was advancing north-northwestward with maximum sustained winds of 144 kilometers (90 miles) per hour, according to the meteorological agency. It was traveling northward at a speed of 40 kph (25 mph). It reached Kawasaki, a western part of greater Tokyo, late Saturday and headed to Tsukuba city to the north about an hour later, before it was expected to swerve toward the sea, the agency said. The storm brought heavy rainfall in wide areas of Japan all day ahead of its landfall, including in Shizuoka and Mie prefectures, southwest of Tokyo, as well as Chiba to the north, which saw power outages and damaged homes in a typhoon last month. Under gloomy skies, a tornado ripped through Chiba on Saturday, overturning a car in the city of Ichihara and killing a man inside the vehicle, city official Tatsuya Sakamaki said. Five people were injured when the tornado ripped through a house. Their injuries were not life-threatening, Sakamaki said. The heavy rain caused rivers to swell, and several had flooded by late Saturday. The wind flipped anchored boats and whipped up sea waters in a dangerous surge along the coast and areas near rivers, flooding some residential neighborhoods and leaving people to wade in ankle-deep waters and cars floating. Some roads were so flooded they looked like muddy ditches. An earthquake shook the area drenched by the rainfall shortly before the typhoon made landfall in Shizuoka prefecture Saturday evening. but there were no immediate reports of damage. The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 5.3 quake was centered in the ocean off the coast of Chiba, near Tokyo, and was fairly deep, at 59.5 kilometers (37 miles). Deep quakes tend to cause less damage than shallow ones. In Shizuoka, one of two men who went missing in the Nishikawa River was rescued, Gotemba city official Fumihiko Katsumata said. Firefighters said the two men were working at a river canal to try to control overflowing when they were swept away. The nationally circulated Yomiuri newspaper put the storm’s casualty toll at two people dead, three missing and 62 injured. More than 170,000 people had evacuated, the paper said. More than 370,000 homes suffered power outages as a result of the typhoon, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co. Yusuke Ikegaya, a Shizuoka resident who evacuated ahead of the storm, said he was surprised that the nearby river was about to overflow in the morning, hours before the typhoon made landfall. “In the 28 years of my life, this is the first time I’ve had to evacuate even before a typhoon has landed,” he said. Authorities also warned of mudslides, common in mountainous Japan. Two dams began to release some of their waters and other dams in the area may take similar measures, as waters were nearing limits, public broadcaster NHK reported. An overflooded dam is likely to cause greater damage, and so releasing some water gradually is a standard emergency measure, but the released water added to the heavy rainfall could be dangerous, causing rivers to flood. Rugby World Cup matches, concerts and other events in the typhoon’s path were canceled, while flights were grounded and train services halted. Authorities acted quickly, with warnings issued earlier in the week, including urging people to stay indoors. Some 17,000 police and military troops were called up, standing ready for rescue operations. Residents taped up their apartment windows to prevent them from shattering. TV talks shows showed footage of household items like a slipper bashing through glass when hurled by winds. Evacuation centers were set up in coastal towns, and people rested on gymnasium floors, saying they hoped their homes were still there after the storm passed. The typhoon disrupted a three-day weekend in Japan that includes Sports Day on Monday. Qualifying for a Formula One auto race in Suzuka was pushed to Sunday. The Defense Ministry cut a three-day annual navy review to a single day on Monday. All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines grounded most domestic and international flights at the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya airports, and some Sunday flights have also been canceled. Central Japan Railway Co. canceled bullet-train service between Tokyo and Osaka except for several early Saturday trains connecting Nagoya and Osaka. Tokyo Disneyland was closed, while Ginza department stores and smaller shops throughout Tokyo were shuttered. A typhoon that hit the Tokyo region in 1958 left more than 1,200 people dead and half a million houses flooded.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104050", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Confederation of Indigenous Nations of Ecuador said on its Twitter account that after internal discussion “we have decided to participate in direct dialogue” with Moreno. Minutes after that tweet, Leonidas Iza, a Quechua leader from mountainous Cotopaxi province, told Ecuavisa television that “we have asked for minimal conditions for dialogue,” including what he called an end to government violence against protesters. Previously, indigenous protesters had refused to negotiate until Moreno restored fuel subsidies whose cancelations prompted days of protests around Ecuador. On Friday, the president had called for the sides to sit down immediately. “The country must recover its calm,” he said on national television. “Let’s sit down and talk.” The softening of the indigenous leadership’s position in response to Moreno came as street blockades and sporadic violence spread around the capital city, Quito. Groups of hooded young men used rocks and burning tires to block streets in neighborhoods so far untouched by the unrest. Some drivers, pedestrians and owners of small businesses reported being threatened and robbed. The indigenous leaders have distanced themselves from the violent gangs, calling them instigators unconnected to the native groups’ cause. Several masked men broke in and appeared to set fires Saturday inside the national auditor’s office, across from the street from the park and cultural complex that have been the epicenter of the protests. Black smoke could be seen billowing from the building. An indigenous leader and four other people have died in clashes with authorities, according to the public defender’s office. The president’s office has reported two deaths. Hundreds of protesters have been injured and hundreds more briefly detained. Ecuador, a former OPEC member, was left deeply in debt by a decade of high-spending governance and the oil price drop. Faced with a $64 billion debt and a $10 billion annual deficit, Moreno is raising taxes, liberalizing labor laws and cutting public spending in order to win more than $4 billion in emergency financing from the International Monetary Fund. As part of that plan, Moreno eliminated a subsidy on the price of fuel on Oct. 2, driving the most popular variety of gasoline from $1.85 to $2.39 a gallon and diesel from $1.03 to $2.30. Panic and speculation sent prices soaring, with costs of some products — papayas, rural bus fares — doubling or more. Ecuador’s indigenous people, wracked by poverty and underserved by government programs, were infuriated. Over the last week, thousands of Shuar, Saraguro, Quechua and other indigenous people streamed into Quito from deep in the Amazon rainforest and high in the towns and villages of the Ecuadorian Andes. They have set up camp in the Casa de la Cultura, the neighboring park known as El Arbolito and three universities, supported by thousands of protesters from Quito and surrounding areas. At least once a day, young men with sticks and rocks surge toward the legislature and try to take it over, as they’ve done at least once this week, before being driven out with tear gas. The protests have halted activity in much of the southern end of the capital and prompted Moreno to temporarily move the seat of government to the Pacific port city of Guayaquil. Indigenous protesters also launched attacks on Amazon oil wells that have paralyzed production, the country’s main export, by cutting off generators and forcing essential staff to leave. Despite the dire situation, Moreno has said he cannot restore the fuel subsidies. The country is broke and backing down to protesters would be a defeat for the president’s effort to undo the policies of his predecessor and former mentor, Rafael Correa. Moreno has received statements of support from the U.S., the Organization of American States and a group of Latin American countries that emphasize he took office as Ecuador’s constitutionally elected president in 2017.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104051", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Some examples: TRUMP, on Hunter Biden, whose father is former Vice President Joe Biden, a Trump political rival: “Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing, walks out with $1.5 billion. Gee, flies in on Air Force 2 with his father, the vice president. … So China gives his son $1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China? I don’t think so.” — Minneapolis rally Thursday. THE FACTS: There’s no evidence Hunter Biden pocketed $1.5 billion from China. More generally, accusations of criminal wrongdoing by father or son are unsubstantiated. In 2014, an investment fund started by Hunter Biden and other investors joined with foreign and Chinese private equity firms in an effort to raise $1.5 billion to invest outside China. That’s far from giving Hunter Biden such a sum, as Trump describes it. Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, told the PolitiFact website that his client was an unpaid director of the fund at the time and it ended up raising less than one-third of its target. Trump’s attempt to press Ukraine to investigate the Bidens is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into the president’s activities in office; Trump also has called for China to investigate them. Joe Biden is contending for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run against Trump. ___ TRUMP: “Adam should be Impeached!” — tweet Tuesday. TRUMP, on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: “Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech …This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle’ Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors … I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly ‘Colluded’ with them, must all be immediately Impeached!” — tweet Sunday. THE FACTS: There’s no danger that either Schiff or Pelosi, who last month launched impeachment proceedings against Trump, will be impeached themselves. That’s because House members cannot be impeached under the Constitution. The House does have the power to expel one of its members by a two-thirds vote, but there are little grounds for it based on what Trump alleges. Trump’s reference to a “fraudulent speech” comes from remarks Schiff made last month at a committee hearing, when he mocked the president’s pleas in his July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Schiff said his remarks were a parody, reflecting the “essence” of what he believed Trump was conveying to Zelenskiy, “shorn of its rambling character.” Trump routinely mocks critics, as he did in this tweet, and invents dialogue that he attributes to them. The House has expelled only five of its own, based on charges of members supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War or bribery and corruption. ___ TRUMP, on removing U.S. troops from Syria: “I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don’t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China, because they love seeing us bogged…down.” — tweets Monday. THE FACTS: That’s a dubious reading of Russia, in particular. Both Russia and Iran stand to gain from a U.S. troop withdrawal and will probably bide their time until they can move in and retake the area. With their help, Syrian President Bashar Assad has recaptured most of the Syrian territory except for the north and east. Iran and Russia are both key allies of Assad’s government with troops on the ground in Syria. While they may publicly oppose a Turkish incursion into Syria , they probably don’t mind an operation that diminishes the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces. Some of Turkey’s incursions into Syria appeared to have been coordinated with Russia and Iran. ___ TRUMP: “We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.” — tweet Thursday. TRUMP: “When I arrived in Washington, ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.” — tweet Monday. THE FACTS: His claim of a 100% defeat is misleading because the Islamic State group still poses a threat. IS was defeated in Iraq in 2017, then lost the last of its land holdings in Syria in March, marking the end of the extremists’ self-declared caliphate. Still, extremist sleeper cells have continued to launch attacks in Iraq and Syria and are believed to be responsible for targeted killings against local officials and members of the Syrian Democratic Forces. IS controlled large swathes of northern and eastern Syria, where they declared a caliphate in 2014 along with large parts of neighboring Iraq. U.N. experts warned in August that IS leaders are aiming to consolidate and create conditions for an “eventual resurgence in its Iraqi and Syrian heartlands.” ___ TRUMP: “So many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States, in fact they make the structural steel frame for our F-35 Fighter Jet.” — tweet Tuesday. THE FACTS: Actually, Turkey won’t be providing the steel for U.S. F-35 fighter jets much longer. The Trump administration removed Turkey from the F-35 program in July because the Turks refused to cancel the purchase of a Russian S-400 air defense system that is incompatible with NATO forces. At the time, the White House said the S-400 would compromise the F-35 program and aid Russian intelligence. As part of that process, the U.S. said it will stop using any Turkish supplies and parts by March. ___ TRUMP: “We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, …including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA!” — tweet Monday. TRUMP: “Most of them came from Europe.” — Minneapolis rally. THE FACTS: Not true. The foreign fighters captured and being held by the U.S.-allied Kurds are not mostly from Europe, which Trump has argued could easily reclaim them. Of the more than 12,000 IS fighters in custody in Kurdish areas, only 2,500 are from outside the region of the conflict, some from Europe, some from other parts of the world. But most of captured fighters — about 10,000 — are natives of Syria or Iraq. Trump has said it will now be up to countries in the region to decide what to do with captured fighters. ___ TRUMP, criticizing Barack Obama’s struggle to win confirmation of federal judges as president, contends “they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships (a record by far), handing them all to me to choose.” — tweet Wednesday. THE FACTS: First, his number is false. So is his insinuation that Obama couldn’t fill judicial vacancies due to complacency. It’s true that Trump has a stronger record than Obama so far in picking federal judges. But it was due to unprecedented lack of action by the Republican-controlled Senate on Democrat Obama’s judicial nominees in his last two years in office. That left Trump more vacancies to fill. Of the 71 people whom Obama nominated to the district courts and courts of appeals in 2015 and 2016, only 20 were voted on and confirmed, said Russell Wheeler, an expert on judicial nominees at the Brookings Institution. Trump entered office in January 2017 with under 110 vacancies on the federal bench — not 142 as he asserts — about double the number Obama had in 2009. Trump has since been aided by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has pushed through Trump’s nominations of appeals court judges in particular. ___ TRUMP: “If our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now, China would be the No. 1 economy anywhere in the world. And right now, I can tell you, they’re not even close.” — Minneapolis rally. TRUMP: “So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in. By now, they would have caught us. And now it’s going to be a long time before they catch us, if they ever catch us. I don’t think anybody is going to catch us.” — remarks Monday on trade . THE FACTS: No matter who got elected in 2016 — Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton — there is no way China’s economy would have caught up with America’s by now. Even if the U.S. economy hadn’t grown at all since 2016, China’s gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — would have had to have surged a fantastical 79% in three years to have pulled even with America’s. That comes to growth of more than 21% a year — something even China’s super-charged economy has never approached. Moreover, despite Trump’s suggestion that China can’t ever catch up, the Chinese economy continues to slowly narrow the gap because every year it grows much faster than America’s. In 2019, for example, the International Monetary Fund expects Chinese GDP to increase 6.2%, more than double the 2.6% growth it expects for the United States. ___ RONNA MCDANIEL, Republican National Committee chair: “New data is out on median income growth: Under Barack Obama, incomes rose $11 a month. Under @realDonaldTrump, incomes are rising at $161 a month. That’s huge!” — tweet Monday, retweeted by Trump. THE FACTS: This comparison is misleading. McDaniel didn’t provide her data source. But her statement obscures the track records of both presidents and the economic conditions that their administrations inherited. For the first two full years of Trump’s presidency, the Census Bureau shows that median household income has been growing by a monthly average of $58, to $63,179 in 2018. That’s almost one-third of what claimed in McDaniel’s tweet. Under Obama, incomes rose at a monthly average of only $31. But that average includes Obama’s first term, when the economy was dealing with the ravages from the Great Recession that began before he became president. Trump took office at a moment when the economy was relatively healthy. Obama’s track record improved sharply after 2012, as the recovery took hold. Median incomes during that period rose at a monthly average of $122. That is more than double the income growth during Trump’s first two years. ___ TRUMP: “As you know, in addition to what we’re talking about today, they’re building — Japan — many car plants in the United States, which they weren’t doing for a long time. And they’re building in Michigan, Ohio, lots of different states. And we just appreciate it very much. Been a tremendous investment.” — remarks Monday on trade. THE FACTS: Not true. Japanese automakers are not building “many” car plants in the U.S. No Japanese automakers are building assembly plants in Michigan, and Honda is making only a small investment at an existing facility in Anna, Ohio, near Dayton. Honda has announced it will build a hybrid SUV at a factory in Greensburg, Indiana, but that investment is $4.2 million and will add 34 new jobs. The only major assembly plant being built now by Japanese automakers in the U.S. is the Toyota-Mazda factory in Alabama, which is expected to employ 4,000 people and will start producing vehicles in 2021. Normally, parts-making companies set up operations in or near the main assembly plant, and that’s happening in Huntsville. Six companies are investing about $491 million in the area, creating an expected 1,765 jobs, according to Toyota. Earlier this year, Japanese truck maker Hino opened a new assembly plant in Mineral Wells, West Virginia, investing $100 million and creating 250 jobs. It replaced an older facility that also was in West Virginia. Trump is also wrong to suggest recent construction from Japanese car companies in the U.S. is somehow new. Japanese automakers have been building in the U.S. since the 1970s and have expanded manufacturing over the years. The companies have announced millions in investments to retool existing plants to make new models.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104051", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.mydigitalfc.com", "section": "Just In", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.mydigitalfc.com/economy/271219/inflation-leaves-consumers-teary-eyed-as-pricey-onions-food-items-bite.html", "title": "Inflation leaves consumers teary-eyed as pricey onions, food items bite", "author": "\n                ", "author_link": "", "published_date": "\n                ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "For most part of 2019, the government was successful in price control but the party seemed to have lost the sheen lately.", "text": " Onion literally brought tears to the eyes of consumers as retail prices touched Rs 200 per kilogram and tomato too turned pricier in the last quarter of 2019, leaving many scurrying for changes in dietary ways as costly food items pushed retail inflation to a more than three-year high.

Though trailing behind in the price race, potato joined its buddies of the 'TOP' priority grouping, selling for as high as Rs 30 a kg in retail market for sometime in December due to supply disruptions before moderating to the current level of around Rs 20-25 a kg. Costlier vegetables slowly pushed retail inflation, which had remained well within the Reserve Bank's comfortable level of 4 per cent during most part of 2019, peaked to more than three-year high of 5.54 per cent in November. Tomato, Onion, Potato (TOP) have been accorded 'TOP' priority by central government in 2018-19 Union Budget and a Rs 500 crore Operation Greens was okayed in November last year to boost production and processing of these three commodities to check price volatility in these key kitchen staples. For most part of 2019, the government was successful in price control but the party seemed to have lost the sheen later in the year, thanks to 'TOP' and other food items. Government action to rein-in rising onion prices came in very late, which contracted to import bulk supplies of onion from markets such as Egypt, Turkey and Afghanistan. Even as supplies have been hitting the Indian shores on a daily basis, onion continues to rule at over Rs 130 a kg in various retail domestic markets, potato at Rs 20-30 a kg, while tomato has come down to around Rs 30-40 per kg. Add to this, garlic prices have now started to spike, touching as high as Rs 30-40 for a mere 100 gram. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which mainly gauges the retail inflation to arrive on its bi-monthly monetary policies, has set a medium-term target for Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. In its monetary policy review in December, it raised the retail inflation projection to 5.1-4.7 per cent for the second half of 2019-20 mainly on costlier onion, fruits, pulses, milk and cereals, from 3.5-3.7 per cent projected earlier. For the first half of next fiscal too, it has raised the projection to 4-3.8 per cent. Retail inflation hovered mainly in the range of 2-3.30 per cent during January to August, and started to move up steadily post monsoon as crop damage due to unseasonal rains hurt the supplies in a big way. It unexpectedly hit a pause button on cutting the key (repo) interest rate, giving more importance to prevailing inflation pressure and rising food prices over a worrying slowdown in the economy. The status quo came in after five consecutive cuts in repo rate since February, as the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, unanimously voted to hold the key repo rate at 5.15 per cent and reverse repo rate at 4.90 per cent. \"Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors. First, the upsurge in prices of vegetables is likely to continue in immediate months; however, a pick-up in arrivals from the late kharif season along with measures taken by the government to augment supply through imports should help soften vegetables prices by early February 2020,\" RBI said on December 5. ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar expects moderation in vegetable prices to a large extent by early 2020. \"Healthy groundwater and reservoir levels bode well for rabi output and yields of various cereals. However, the year-on-year decline in the area sown under rabi pulses and oilseeds poses a concern, given the high inflation being recorded by some of these items,\" Nayar said. ICRA expects the CPI inflation to spike further to 5.8-6 per cent in December 2019. On the wholesale front, the 2019 inflation story was on a different trajectory with prices moving downwards from a high of 3.58 per cent in January to the lowest 0.16 per cent in October mainly on account of cheaper fuel and power. The up-tick of WPI inflation to 0.58 per cent in November was attributable to costlier vegetables, mainly onion as well as pulses. As per the government data, prices of onion in the wholesale market went up by 172 per cent in November from a year ago. On the WPI-CPI divergence, brokerage firm Anand Rathi said at 5.5 per cent in November, retail inflation was at a multi-year high while, in the same month, WPI inflation at 0.6 per cent was modest. \"High food inflation contrasted with deflation in fuel and manufactured product inflation is creating this situation as the retail price index assigns much higher weights to food than does the WPI. Besides, the inclusion of services in retail but not in the wholesale index continued, as, despite being on a falling clip, services inflation was relatively elevated,\" as per Anand Rathi. CARE Ratings expects inflation to range in 4-4.5 per cent for the rest of the year (2019-20), adding the \"base effect will not be favourable in the coming months\". While the surge in vegetable prices will eventually reverse, the elevated inflation for pulses needs to be watched with caution, unless rabi sowing picks up pace, according to Nayar. \"The RBI rate pause is likely to continue. The RBI targets retail inflation, which has jumped 240 basis points (bps) in the last four months and is now close to the upper end of the RBI's target zone. Consequently, despite low core and WPI inflation, as also deflation in fuel and manufactured product prices, the RBI is unlikely to cut the policy rate soon. Low growth, however, rules out any rate hike,\" Anand Rathi brokerage said.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104049", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Orion's thermal protection system is one of the most critical parts of the spacecraft intended to facilitate human exploration of asteroids and of Mars. It consists of the spacecraft's main heat shield that faces into the atmosphere on reentry to slow the spaceship down and also the grid of tiles known as the back shell. During Orion's next mission atop the agency's Space Launch System rocket, called Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the spacecraft will be in space for more than three weeks and return to Earth under even faster and hotter conditions than during its last flight. \"As we move towards building the system for EM-1, we've been able to take advantage of what we learned from building and flying Orion to refine our processes going forward,\" said John Kowal, NASA's thermal protection system lead for Orion. During EM-1, Orion will endure a more intense re-entry environment. While the spacecraft encountered speeds of 30,000 feet per second during Exploration Flight Test-1 and temperatures of approximately 2,204 degrees Celsius, it will experience a faster return from lunar velocity of about 36,000 feet per second. The speed difference may seem subtle, but the heating the vehicle sees increases exponentially as the speed increases. Engineering teams are preparing Orion's heat shield to perform re-entry during any of missions planned near the Moon or in high lunar orbit in the coming years. For these future Orion missions, a silver, metallic-based thermal control coating will be bonded to the crew module's thermal protection system back shell tiles. The coating, similar to what is used on the main heat shield, will reduce heat loss during phases when Orion is pointed to space and therefore experiencing cold temperatures, as well as limit the high temperatures the crew module will be subjected to when the spacecraft faces the Sun. The coating will help Orion's back shell maintain a temperature range from approximately minus 101 to 287 degrees Celsius prior to entry and also will protect against electrical surface charges in space and during re-entry. Engineers have also refined the design in ways that improve the manufacturing process and reduce the mass of the spacecraft for the upcoming exploration missions. Instead of a monolithic outer layer, the heat shield will be made of about 180 blocks that can be made simultaneously with the other heat shield components to streamline the labour-and-time-intensive manufacturing process. In addition, engineers have found ways to reduce the mass of the heat shield's underlying structure, which is composed of a titanium skeleton and carbon fiber skin. Teams have optimised the thickness of the skeleton and the skin based on the pressures that different areas will experience during flight and reentry, adding more fidelity to the overall structure while allowing it to be lighter.

Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the recent passing away of Siraj’s father, the celebrations were muted and confined to indoors. But the family members of the fast bowler, who made his Test debut against Australia on Saturday, were excited while they followed the game on the television. The moment Siraj took to the field with his teammates, his mother Shabana Begum’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. Speaking after watching his son don Indian colours, she said her husband’s (Mohammed Ghouse) dream finally fulfilled. “  (It is all the grace of Almighty). Thanks to God, his father would be proud of him today,” she said. When asked about their feeling ahead of his debut, she said, “We got up very early to watch him play. We were excited and happy. But when he took the field and stood there with his teammates singing the national anthem, it brought us tears.” Siraj had a wonderful debut picking up two crucial wickets that helped India skittle out Australia for 195 runs on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. When asked about their feeling after Siraj picked up his first wicket, Shabana said, “We can’t express the feeling. Playing for country has always been his and his father’s dream. Now he made the country proud.” Shabana, who was worried for Siraj for neglecting his studies and focusing on cricket, added she wants her son to win matches for India. Siraj’s grandmother Sardar Bhi said that the family was delighted. “Due to his father’s death, the family mourning will continue for three months. So we told Siraj’s friends not to come to the house for watching the match. We know they are all excited to share their joy with us. But this is a tough time.” “We started getting calls early in the morning when he took those two wickets. We switched off our mobiles and kept it aside to watch the match,” she added. Siraj’s brother Mohammed Ismail said he was over the moon. “I wasn’t feeling well in the morning, so I watched till lunch and slept off. But I have been receiving calls from people congratulating us. It is a great moment for our family,” he added. A long time friend of Siraj, Mohd Shafi said that he is poised for greater things. “I am very happy to see Siraj playing for the country. If his father was here, he would have been very happy. I spoke to his mother, she was also very happy. I spoke to Siraj as well after the first day’s game. He said if people support him, he would do many great things for the country. Siraj revealed that it is just the start and he has been working very hard.” Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

It said 29 people have died in Bengkulu province on the island of Sumatra over the weekend. Two people died from flooding in parts of the capital Jakarta last week and more than 2,000 were displaced. \n     In Bengkulu, 13 people were missing and more than 12,000 had fled their inundated homes, the agency said. The highest number of deaths was in central Bengkulu where a landslide killed nearly two dozen people.

Two other police officers were wounded when a bomb attached to their car exploded earlier Saturday in southern Kabul, Faramarz said. Maooma Jafari, deputy spokeswoman for the health ministry, said that four corpses and four wounded people were taken to hospital following the two explosions. A third sticky bomb detonated in eastern Kabul but caused no casualties, he said. There were reports of at least two other blasts elsewhere in the city but police had no immediate details. In a separate report form northern Balkh province, a senior army officer was killed when his vehicle hit a roadside bomb, said Arif Iqbali, a Sholgara district police chief. Iqbali said that Mohammad Tareq, the garrison commander of the army brigade in Balkh was the apparent target who was killed in the attack. The latest attacks came as Taliban and Afghan government negotiators held talks in Qatar, trying to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war. No one has immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Kabul. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital in recent months, including on educational institutions that killed 50 people, most of them students. The talks in Doha have been suspended until early January and there is speculation they could be further delayed. At the same time, Taliban militants have waged bitter battles against IS fighters, particularly in eastern Afghanistan, while continuing their insurgency against government forces and keeping their promise not to attack U.S. and NATO troops.

Trump’s refusal to sign the bipartisan package as he demands larger COVID relief checks and complains about “pork” spending could also force a federal government shutdown when money runs out at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday in the middle of a pandemic. “It’s a chess game and we are pawns,” said Lanetris Haines, a self-employed single mother of three in South Bend, Indiana, who stands to lose her $129 weekly jobless benefit unless Trump signs the package into law or succeeds in his improbable quest for changes. Washington has been reeling since Trump threw the package into limbo after it had already won sweeping approval in both houses of Congress and after the White House assured Republican leaders that Trump would support it. Instead, he has assailed the bill’s plan to provide $600 COVID relief checks to most Americans — insisting it should be $2,000. House Republicans swiftly rejected that idea during a rare Christmas Eve session. But Trump has not been swayed. “I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill,” Trump tweeted Saturday from Palm Beach, Florida, where he is spending the holiday. “Also, stop the billions of dollars in ‘pork.’” President-elect Joe Biden called on Trump to sign the bill immediately as two federal programs providing unemployment aid were set to expire Saturday. “It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don’t know if they’ll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump’s refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,” Biden said in a statement. He accused Trump of an “abdication of responsibility” that has “devastating consequences.” “I’ve been talking to people who are scared they’re going to be kicked out from their homes, during the Christmas holidays, and still might be if we don’t sign this bill,” said Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat. Lauren Bauer, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, has calculated that 11 million people would lose aid from the programs immediately without additional relief; millions more would exhaust other unemployment benefits within weeks. Andrew Stettner, an unemployment insurance expert and senior fellow at the Century Foundation think tank, said the number may be closer to 14 million because joblessness has spiked since Thanksgiving. “All these folks and their families will suffer if Trump doesn’t sign the damn bill,” Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, tweeted Wednesday. How and when people are affected by the lapse depends on the state they live in, the program they are relying on and when they applied for benefits. In some states, people on regular unemployment insurance could continue to receive payments under a program that extends benefits when the jobless rate surpasses a certain threshold, Stettner said. About 9.5 million people, however, rely on the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that expires altogether Saturday. That program made unemployment insurance available to freelancers, gig workers and others who are normally not eligible. After receiving their last checks, those recipients will not be able to file for more aid after Saturday, Stettner said. While payments could be received retroactively, any gap means more hardship and uncertainty for Americans who have already grappled with bureaucratic delays, often depleting much of their savings to stay afloat while waiting for payments to kick in. They are people like Earl McCarthy, a father of four who lives in South Fulton, Georgia, and has been relying on unemployment since losing his job as a sales representative for a luxury senior living community. He said he will be left with no income by the second week of January if Trump fails to sign the bill. McCarthy said he already burned through much of his savings as he waited five months to begin receiving his unemployment benefits. After leaving weekly messages with the unemployment agency, McCarthy reached out to the South Fulton mayor’s office, then to his state legislative representative to ask for help. He finally started getting payments in November. “The entire experience was horrifying,” said McCarthy, who is receiving about $350 a week in unemployment insurance. “For me, I shudder to think if I had not saved anything or had an emergency fund through those five months, where would we have been?” he said. “It’s going to be difficult if the president doesn’t sign this bill.” The bill awaiting Trump’s signature would also activate a weekly $300 federal supplement to unemployment payments. Sharon Shelton Corpening had been hoping the extra help would allow her 83-year-old mother, with whom she lives, to stop eating into her social security payments to make their $1,138 rent. Corpening, who lives in the Atlanta area, had launched a freelance content strategy business that was just taking off before the pandemic hit, prompting several of her contracts to fall through. She is receiving about $125 a week under the pandemic unemployment program and says she will be unable to pay her bills in about a month. This, despite her temporary work for the U.S. census and as an elections poll worker. “We on the brink,” said Corpening, who lobbies for Unemployment Action, a project launched by the Center for Popular Democracy to fight for relief. “One more month, if that. Then, I run out of everything.” Trump, meanwhile, has been spending his final days in office golfing and angrily tweeting as he refuses to accept his loss to Biden in the Nov. 3 election. On Saturday, he again lashed out at members of his own party for failing to join his quest to try to overturn the results of the election with baseless claims of mass voter fraud that have been repeatedly rejected by the courts. “If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had an Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of such acts at a level never seen before, the Democrat Senators would consider it an act of war, and fight to the death,” he railed. He said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his Republicans “just want to let it pass. NO FIGHT!” Trump also lashed out at the Supreme Court, the Justice Department and the FBI as he seemed to encourage his supporters to gather in Washington on Jan. 6, the day Congress tallies the Electoral College vote — even though a similar event last month  , with multiple people being stabbed in the capital’s streets. In addition to freezing unemployment benefits, Trump’s lack of action on the bill would lead to the expiration of eviction protections and put on hold a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters, along with money to help schools and vaccine distribution. The relief is also attached to a $1.4 trillion government funding bill to keep the federal government operating.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104056", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.cbsnews.com", "section": "World", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cyclone-kenneth-mozambique-death-toll-flooding-today-live-updates-2019-04-29/", "title": "Cyclone in Mozambique: Death toll jumps after 2nd huge storm in 6 weeks, and rain still falling", "author": "", "author_link": null, "published_date": "1", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "Rains from  , the second tropical storm to hit Mozambique in just six weeks, continued to pound the country's northeast on Monday causing massive flooding and destruction as the death toll from the storm jumped.

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104056", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The next wave of growth could come from increasing exports to large and traditionally under penetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Latin America, which would help the industry meet its aspiration of becoming the world's largest supplier by volume, according to pharma industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). Experts said improved access to medicines in India and exploring new markets while maintaining thrust in the US will help the country's pharma industry to record double-digit growth in the coming year. However, the sector, specially pharmaceuticals, will be up against headwinds of increased costs related to regulatory compliances, particularly for the US market, price controls across markets and mandatory genericisation in India. \"The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is a sunrise industry with a competitive advantage for India. We should leverage India's position by unleashing entrepreneurial spirit through policy stability and ecosystem,\" IPA Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said. The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily. Medical devices makers' body, AdvaMed Vice President Abby Pratt said it would urge the government to promote the adoption of global harmonisation, including internationally recognised standards, that would not only help ensure the quality and efficacy of products but also enable an ecosystem for manufacturing, research, and innovation for benefits of patients in India.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104057", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

To keep a pace bowler to twiddle his thumbs till after the luncheon interval is to test his mental fibre. But for Hyderabad’s Mohammad Siraj it was a blessing in disguise. The anticipation had only enhanced his focus and determination to perform at his best. His true character — his patience, his perseverance, his innate skills — came to the fore. This was indeed a dream Test debut for the Hyderabadi. The 26-year-old speedster was on a roll as a bowler and then held his nerves to bring off two catches in the deep to make a memorable debut against Australia on the Boxing Day of the second Test that got underway at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday. He finished with figures of 15-4-40-2. Stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane made the 26-year-old Siraj wait till 28th over, before he was given the ball. But Siraj scalped his first Test wicket with his 43rd ball in his second spell. With his third ball of his eighth over, he had the dangerous Marnus Labuschagne caught at leg slip by another Indian debutant of the match Shubman Gill. Labuschagne, who was hit on the helmet by a vicious Siraj bouncer earlier, tried to play the ball on leg side but it went to Gill, who caught it nicely. Siraj captured his second Test wicket when he trapped the tall Cameron Green leg before to get another big breakthrough for India. This time the fiery Siraj brought the ball in sharply to catch Green on the crease to get a favourable verdict from Australian umpire Paul Reiffel. The batsman referred the decision to DRS and the ball tracker showed the ball hitting the leg stump. A happy Siraj was surrounded by his teammates The Australian commentators were all praise for Siraj’s excellent bowling. Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath said Siraj was exceptional. Siraj further came into action when he held his first catch at fine leg, this time left-hander Michael Starc hooked Jasprit Bumrah straight into the fielder’s hands. The Hyderabad yet again held his nerve to clasp a skier at long on to dismiss the last man Pat Cummins off left-arm spinner Ravinder Jadeja. Surely Siraj’s father, late Mohammed Ghouse, who died last month, would be a happy man and would have blessed his son from heaven. Earlier, it was a huge moment when seasoned off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin handed over the Indian Test cap to him. “Coming over from first class and India A grind, you have earned this Test cap. Value it,’’ said Ashwin to Siraj in the morning’s ceremony. Siraj, a son of an autorickshaw driver, is the second Hyderabad fast bowler after Syed Abid Ali to play in Test cricket. Abid Ali claimed 6 for 55 in his debut Test in Adelaide in 1966. Former Test left-arm spinner SL Venkatapathy Raju said it is always a great feeling when a player gets a Test cap and a great relief and joy when a player takes his first Test wicket. “I made my debut in New Zealand in Christchurch in 1990 and as a spinner I had to wait to get my first over. You feel butterflies in your stomach anxious to get the first over. It was strange that skipper Ajinkya Rahane made Siraj, that too a fast bowler in Australia, to bowl his first over after lunch only. “But nevertheless Siraj bowled with a lot of fire. He has come through the first class and India A tour grinds. He looks like a solid prospect, said Raju. The 26-year-old fast bowler thus became the 298th player to get the Indian cap. There were two debutants in this match with opener Shubnam Gill becoming the 297th player. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

Russia has previously acknowledged training sea mammals for special operations in the frigid Arctic, where the country has a major military base not far from the territory of  . \n     According to Britain's The Guardian newspaper, Norwegian state broadcaster   reported the unusual behavior of the animal last week and showed video of the beluga whale swimming alongside a fishing vessel and repeatedly nudging it. \"We were going to put out nets when we saw a whale swimming between the boats,\" NRK quoted fisherman Joar Hesten as saying. \"It came over to us, and as it approached, we saw that it had some sort of harness on it.\" \n  \n  \n\n \n The harness was removed from the animal by a team from the Norwegian Director of Fisheries. Jørgen Ree Wiig, from the agency, sent CBS News images and video of the whale and the harness, which has a logo on it reading, \"Equipment of St. Petersburg.\" The canvas straps appeared slightly worn and there was visible rust on the metal screws holding the apparatus together.  There was nothing about the harness to identify it has having any links, specifically, to Russia's military, and the clip with the logo on it was written in English. But Norwegian scientists suspect a link to the Russian navy, nonetheless.  \"If this whale comes from Russia – and there is great reason to believe it – then it is not Russian scientists, but rather the navy that has done this,\" Martin Biuw of the Institute of Marine Research in Norway told NRK. \n\n    \n           \"We know that in Russia they have had domestic whales in captivity and also that some of these have apparently been released,\" Audun Rikardsen, a professor of marine biology at the Arctic University of Norway, told NRK according to The Guardian. \"Then they often seek out boats.\" \n     But Rikardsen said he'd spoken to Russian scientists and they denied any knowledge of the harnessed whale: \"They tell me that most likely is the Russian navy in Murmansk.\" Russia's military has a history of trying to weaponize whales and other sea mammals.  The Cold War-era Soviet Union had a program to train seals, dolphins and other animals to help detect underwater weapons and alert their military trainers. That program ran until the 1990s officially, but it is unclear whether it has ever been shut down or just changed. In 2017, Russia's TV Zvezda, which is owned by the defense ministry in Moscow, aired a report on a Russian navy program to train beluga whales, seals and dolphins for similar purposes. \n\n    \n           The Guardian said those recent efforts were carried out by a private research institute on behalf of the navy to see if beluga whales could, \"guard entrances to naval bases\" in the arctic and \"assist deepwater divers and if necessary kill any strangers who enter their territory,\" according to the Russian TV report. The newspaper says public Russian government records show the defense ministry spent about $25,000 purchasing five bottle-nosed dolphins in 2016 from a sea life center in Moscow. Just last year a group of Russian scientists was presented an award by the Russian Academy of Sciences for their work on \"the use of marine mammals for official purposes.\" A note congratulating the scientists on the Academy's website notes that the use of combat seals might again become relevant for Russia given the increase in \"the terrorist threat.\" \n     On Monday, Russia's state-run Interfax news agency quoted a scientist who appeared to confirm that the country's military was working with beluga whales. Interfax said Dmitry Glazov, of the A.N. Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution in Moscow, worked with the same kind of animals. Glazov noted that belugas had been deployed by the security services around the Sochi Olympics. \"There is an institute in St. Petersburg that cooperates with the military in studying animals for applied purposes, and its (specialists) work in the Cossack Bay on the Black Sea and in Murmansk,\" he said, speculating that one of the animals based at the institute simply \"ran away.\" Over the past three years, President Vladimir Putin has reopened three former Soviet military bases along its vast Arctic coastline as Russia and NATO accuse each other of increasingly bellicose actions along their shared border in the far northern reaches of Europe. As CBS News chief national security correspondent   on Sunday, Russia has been conducting simulated attacks near Norwegian territory with nuclear-capable warplanes. \n\n           That, Norwegian joint force commander Lt. Gen. Rune Jakobsen told Martin, is \"not something you should do to your neighbor.\" In response to Russia's mounting belligerence in the region -- and in the wake of Putin's unilateral   from Ukraine -- NATO held its largest war games to date in Norway last fall. As Martin reported, Norway shares a 120-mile border with Russia, and its long Arctic coastline includes the closest points on European soil to the base of Russia's northern fleet, with its naval bases, airfields and nuclear weapons storage sites. The fleet, based on the remote Kola Peninsula, represent Russia's single greatest concentration of military power, especially submarines. \n     Martin was given rare access to the Norwegian military planes and ships tasked with monitoring Russia's actions in the Arctic, including their navy's newest surveillance vessel which has been equipped with the latest U.S. technology to detect submarines. If what the Norwegian fishermen found is evidence of a current program by Russia's military, the Norwegians and their NATO partners might need to start looking for much smaller weapons of war, too -- weapons with flippers.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/29/204b7a7e-5cba-4b36-b689-d981ccc52055/thumbnail/620x406/82129a02a3327c91cde6721bab1290c5/norway-whale-harness-russia.jpg#\" alt=\"norway-whale-harness-russia.jpg \" height=\"406\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/29/204b7a7e-5cba-4b36-b689-d981ccc52055/thumbnail/620x406/82129a02a3327c91cde6721bab1290c5/norway-whale-harness-russia.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/29/204b7a7e-5cba-4b36-b689-d981ccc52055/thumbnail/1240x812/2d5b186380bbe14ae43868a906eee91f/norway-whale-harness-russia.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20406'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104056", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Elephants tend to have smaller sperm than mice because the larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length, a new study suggests. In the animal world, if several males mate with the same female, their sperm compete to fertilise her limited supply of eggs. Longer sperm often seem to have a competitive advantage.  However, the study conducted by researchers from the Universities of Zurich and Stockholm now shows that the size of the animals also matters. The larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length. That is why elephants have smaller sperm than mice, researchers said. Stefan Lupold from the University of Zurich and his colleague John Fitzpatrick from University of Stockholm compared the influence of sperm competition on the evolution of sperm in 100 mammalian species.  Unlike previous studies, however, they did not just consider sperm length, but also the number of sperm per ejaculate, which is important as the resources available for sperm production need to be shared between sperm size and number. In other words, the longer every individual sperm, the fewer of them a testicle of a certain size can produce. Earlier studies suggested that the number of sperm might be just as important as sperm length, if not even more so.  After all, the more sperm a male fields against his competitors, the greater the likelihood that one of them will win. Based on their joint consideration of sperm size and number, and with the aid of new meta-analytical methods, the researchers now show that species facing intense sperm competition invest more in their ejaculates on average than their monogamous counterparts. Moreover, they discovered that whether the length or the number of sperm is more important actually depends on the size of the animals.  The bigger the animal, the greater the selection pressure on the overall investments in ejaculates and the more important the number of sperm becomes compared to sperm length. This is due to the more voluminous female reproductive tract, in which the sperm tend to get lost or become \"diluted.\"  In larger species, sperm length or speed probably comes into effect only if a sufficient number of sperm manage to get near the egg, researchers said. In smaller species, however, the distance for sperm to cover is shorter and the risk of loss much smaller, allowing the advantage of longer sperm to manifest itself. As a result, you tend to find the most complex sperm forms in small species, not in large ones. For instance, small fruit flies have the longest sperm ever described, not whales, whose sperm are less than a tenth of a millimetre long and almost a thousand times shorter than those of the flies.

But their fight isn't over. The group behind the protests says they are moving on to the next phase of their \"rebellion.\" \n     Activists camped on the edge of London's Hyde Park for 10 days as they took action across the U.K. capital, including gluing themselves to trains, blocking major intersections and shutting down shopping areas. \"I don't go to many marches, this isn't really normal for me, but this one is the most important thing that anyone could ever do,\" a woman carrying an infant told CBS News as she marched past Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. \n  \n  \n\n \n The group behind the demonstrations, Extinction Rebellion, operates out of an upscale office building in central London. Organizers say they use the space rent-free, because the corporate landlord is sympathetic to their cause. Volunteers work on laptops, and signs and fliers are scattered around. The symbol of the group is graffitied over nearly every wall. \"I think about how to effectively change society in a crisis. That's why Extinction Rebellion has been successful,\" said Roger Hallam, who co-founded the group and has been researching effective protest movements for a PhD. \"It's not like three people in a pub going 'let's have a rebellion.' It's like a systematic survey of the academic literature on how societies change radically in a short amount of time,\" he said. \"People need to break the law nonviolently, en masse, preferably in a capital city.\" \n     So that's what the group has been doing -- staging almost daily actions that, according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan, have presented a \"huge challenge\" for London's \"over-stretched and under-resourced\" police.  But Hallam said straining resources is insignificant compared to the threat posed by climate change. \"The theater is on fire,\" Hallam said.  The group is now planning its next steps.  \"The government is guilty of criminal inactivity on climate change. Period,\" Hallam said.  \n\n    \n           Extinction Rebellion protests over the last two weeks coincided with a visit from 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, who visited the U.K. on Tuesday to speak to lawmakers. She has led worldwide school strikes to demand aggressive government action on climate change. \"We have not taken to the streets for you to take selfies with us and tell us that you really admire what we do,\" Thunberg said in Westminster. \"We children are doing this to wake the adults up. We children are doing this for you to put your differences aside and start acting as you would in a crisis.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/731eaded-b6e7-4d87-86f8-48ef44090eb5/thumbnail/620x406g8/2767b150a1049512c76d86217361b1e5/protestlondon.jpg#\" alt=\"The Extinction Rebellion protest in London \" height=\"406\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/731eaded-b6e7-4d87-86f8-48ef44090eb5/thumbnail/620x406g8/2767b150a1049512c76d86217361b1e5/protestlondon.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/731eaded-b6e7-4d87-86f8-48ef44090eb5/thumbnail/1240x812g8/742914dd3be6a467eefc4aa209012e4b/protestlondon.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20406'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104058", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Health Minister Khalid Ait Taleb announced the figure at a Cabinet meeting Thursday. The government didn’t indicate whether the vaccines were purchased or provided by Covax, the global project to provide vaccines to developing countries, or a combination of both. His ministry said Friday that Morocco has not yet received the vaccines. Mustapha Ennaji Moulay, head of the virology department at the Hassan II University in Casablanca and a member of the government’s COVID-19 scientific committee, said that regulators are reviewing the Sinopharm vaccine’s documentation, and that the vaccination program is expected to begin in the coming days. Morocco has one of the most advanced vaccination plans in the region. The country has also reported the second-highest number of virus infections and deaths in Africa, after South Africa. The Moroccan health minister said the government’s target is vaccinating 25 million of the country’s 36 million people, all free of charge, according to orders from King Mohammed VI. While the Moroccan government has been promising vaccinations since earlier this month, the minister said preparations have now reached a “very advanced” stage. He said authorities were carrying out simulations at all the immunization sites “to avoid any obstacles that may arise during the implementation of the vaccination program.” In a first phase, the vaccine will be administered to medical personnel, public authorities, security services, education workers and people suffering from chronic diseases. The Ministry of Health said it has deployed a computerized system to register the target population and track their health status after they receive the vaccine. Moulay said Morocco has sought to diversify supply by signing contracts with multiple countries. Morocco has said it will start its vaccination program with the Sinopharm vaccine, though it hasn’t yet completed advanced trials to prove that it’s safe and effective. The vaccine, which was tested on 600 Moroccans as part of clinical trials this autumn, has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in multiple countries. Morocco’s initial vaccine deliveries will come from China, but Morocco also plans to produce the vaccine locally. The AstraZeneca vaccine is still in advanced trials in countries including Britain and the U.S. and hasn’t been approved yet. Morocco’s daily virus case count has fallen slightly in the last two weeks, but a dip in testing is raising concerns that the virus could be spreading faster than reported. As a preventive measure to curb the spread of the virus during New Year’s celebrations, authorities banned public and private gatherings, closed restaurants in the country’s main cities, and imposed a curfew that went into effect Wednesday night and is set to last for three weeks.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104058", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Lyubov Sobol, a key figure in Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained for 48 hours after a day of interrogation on charges of violent trespassing. The move followed Sobol’s attempt on Monday to enter the Moscow apartment of the alleged operative, whom Navalny had previously duped into describing details of the alleged poisoning.  Sobol has denied the accusations and insisted that she violated no law by ringing the doorbell to the apartment. While Sobol was being questioned, the state Investigative Committee issued a statement accusing her of trespassing — charges her colleagues have rejected. Earlier this week, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he identified as Konstantin Kudryavtsev and described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him with the Soviet-era Novichok agent in August and then tried to cover it up. Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, said he phoned the man hours before the investigative group Bellingcat released a report alleging that FSB operatives with specialized training in chemical weapons followed him for years and were in close vicinity when he was poisoned. In the call, Navalny introduced himself as a security official and beguiled his interlocutor into sharing details of the alleged poisoning operation and acknowledging that he was involved in the “processing” of Navalny’s underwear so “there wouldn’t be any traces” of poison.  Navalny fell sick during the Aug. 20 flight in Russia and was flown to Berlin while still in a coma for treatment two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have vehemently denied any involvement in the poisoning, and the FSB dismissed the recording released by Navalny as fake.

Opposition supporters have rallied for weeks, urging Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down over the Nov. 10 peace deal that saw Azerbaijan reclaim control over large parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas. The Russia-brokered agreement ended 44 days of fierce fighting in which the Azerbaijani army routed Armenian forces. Pashinyan has defended the peace deal as a painful but necessary move to prevent Azerbaijan from overrunning the entire Nagorno-Karabakh region. He argued Friday that his critics lack broad public support for their demand. “I’m not clinging to the prime minister’s seat, but I can’t carelessly treat the post given to me by the people,” he said on Facebook. Pashinyan added that he was ready to hold consultations with the nation’s political parties to discuss calling an early parliamentary election next year. Opposition supporters on Friday continued blocking streets in the Armenian capital and engaged in occasional scuffles with police. Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left Nagorno-Karabakh itself and substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands. Heavy fighting that erupted in late September marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, killing more than 5,600 people on both sides. The Russia-brokered peace agreement stipulated that Armenia hand over control of some areas it holds outside Nagorno-Karabakh’s borders. Azerbaijan also retained control over areas of Nagorno-Karabakh it had taken during the conflict. The peace deal was celebrated in Azerbaijan as a major triumph, and triggered outrage and mass protests in Armenia.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104058", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

In her first interview about the terrifying ordeal,   opened up about how she found humanity in the four men who took her and her tour guide hostage and their days-long journey before a ransom payment secured their release. For days, Endicott and her guide JP Mirenge Remezo had been walking with their captors across the Ugandan border to the more unstable Democratic Republic of Congo. \"And then the sun is setting and we keep walking and it gets to complete, like, pitch darkness,\" she recalled. \"So at one point we stopped. And I look up in the sky and I see the most beautiful sky I've ever seen in my life.\" Even in captivity, Endicott remembered how \"incredible\" the sight was. She used it to connect with the people who took her.  \"It's nothing like I've ever seen before. And that was when I became very aware of humanizing myself to them ... I said, 'Look at the sky.' I said, 'We don't have this at home.'\"  She even pointed out the Milky Way to the men. She said it became her \"mission\" to be human with them so that not only would they see her humanity but it would help her see theirs, too.  \"I remember laying down on the ground and I remember hearing JP say, 'Oh my God,' at my exhaustion. I don't know how long I laid there,\" Endicott said. \"At one point I'm asked to get up. And I turn and look and they've made a tent for me out of tarps and a mosquito net, which, I remember that was the moment where I thought, 'Why are they taking such good care of me?'\" Endicott said a \"relationship\" of sorts began with the young men in the camp.  \"I just start talking to them like I'm talking to you,\" Endicott told King. \"But all the while I'm watching these young men drink water, not from the river, but from a hole in the ground. But they have bottled water for me.\" \n\n           She ended up feeling compassion for the men, saying, \"How could I not?\" \"'Cause that's their life. It's not really above living like an animal. That's their life. If I survive this, I have a life to go back to. That's their life,\" Endicott said. \"That does not condone what they did. Not even close.\"  While a search effort was underway, the kidnappers began making calls to the tour company demanding a ransom and giving JP and Kimberly the phone at points in the negotiations. \"I was able to call my daughter once. They let me do that ... My daughter's besides herself,\" she said. \"Her mother's been kidnapped. But I'm not beside myself. I'm saying, 'Okay we can't, like, we can't do this now. Let's get it together. But tell everybody what's happening. Tell everyone what's happening. Because I don't know what's being done.\" Following five days of negotiations, a ransom was finally paid but it has never been clear where the money came from or how much it was. Once they were free, it was reported across the world.  According to Endicott, it was a woman from the Ugandan Wildlife Authority who met her captors to hand over the money. After that, the same woman and a man with a motorcycle then took the two freed captives to safety.  \"When we pulled into Ishasha Camp I realized just what my government did for me. And I was overcome with shame for thinking they didn't do anything. And gratitude like I've never felt in my life,\" she said.  Even in captivity, Endicott said she was able to find humanity in the men who took her and said they were also her \"protectors.\" \"They could've sold me to a different group. When I went out in the open they had guns that also protected me. It could've been so much worse than it was,\" she said.   Endicott has been back in the states just over two weeks now, but those five days in early April still haunt her. She said she still relives the experience, but a little less every day.   \"Certain things will trigger me. We went for a walk out at a nature area and it just triggered me like nobody's business. The sound of our feet on the ground, pushing bushes out of my way – and so i'm getting in touch with that there's gonna be that probably for a while,\" she said.  Despite what she went through, Endicott believes Uganda is a safe place to visit, that she was the exception to the rule.   \"That was the other thing. That feeling of what this is gonna do to that country that is run by their people and those are immensely friendly, accommodating people. And everyone in hospitality after you would have a conversation, the last thing they said to you was, 'please tell all of your friends to come.'\"  \"So when all of this is said and done do you just look at this as a rag-tag team of people?\" King asked, to which she replied, \"100 percent.\"  \"Hopefully something beautiful is going to come out of this. That's where I have to hold my hope.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg#\" alt=\"promocbsn.jpg \" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg 1x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104058", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104058", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

To keep a pace bowler to twiddle his thumbs till after the luncheon interval is to test his mental fibre. But for Hyderabad’s Mohammad Siraj it was a blessing in disguise. The anticipation had only enhanced his focus and determination to perform at his best. His true character — his patience, his perseverance, his innate skills — came to the fore. This was indeed a dream Test debut for the Hyderabadi. The 26-year-old speedster was on a roll as a bowler and then held his nerves to bring off two catches in the deep to make a memorable debut against Australia on the Boxing Day of the second Test that got underway at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday. He finished with figures of 15-4-40-2. Stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane made the 26-year-old Siraj wait till 28th over, before he was given the ball. But Siraj scalped his first Test wicket with his 43rd ball in his second spell. With his third ball of his eighth over, he had the dangerous Marnus Labuschagne caught at leg slip by another Indian debutant of the match Shubman Gill. Labuschagne, who was hit on the helmet by a vicious Siraj bouncer earlier, tried to play the ball on leg side but it went to Gill, who caught it nicely. Siraj captured his second Test wicket when he trapped the tall Cameron Green leg before to get another big breakthrough for India. This time the fiery Siraj brought the ball in sharply to catch Green on the crease to get a favourable verdict from Australian umpire Paul Reiffel. The batsman referred the decision to DRS and the ball tracker showed the ball hitting the leg stump. A happy Siraj was surrounded by his teammates The Australian commentators were all praise for Siraj’s excellent bowling. Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath said Siraj was exceptional. Siraj further came into action when he held his first catch at fine leg, this time left-hander Michael Starc hooked Jasprit Bumrah straight into the fielder’s hands. The Hyderabad yet again held his nerve to clasp a skier at long on to dismiss the last man Pat Cummins off left-arm spinner Ravinder Jadeja. Surely Siraj’s father, late Mohammed Ghouse, who died last month, would be a happy man and would have blessed his son from heaven. Earlier, it was a huge moment when seasoned off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin handed over the Indian Test cap to him. “Coming over from first class and India A grind, you have earned this Test cap. Value it,’’ said Ashwin to Siraj in the morning’s ceremony. Siraj, a son of an autorickshaw driver, is the second Hyderabad fast bowler after Syed Abid Ali to play in Test cricket. Abid Ali claimed 6 for 55 in his debut Test in Adelaide in 1966. Former Test left-arm spinner SL Venkatapathy Raju said it is always a great feeling when a player gets a Test cap and a great relief and joy when a player takes his first Test wicket. “I made my debut in New Zealand in Christchurch in 1990 and as a spinner I had to wait to get my first over. You feel butterflies in your stomach anxious to get the first over. It was strange that skipper Ajinkya Rahane made Siraj, that too a fast bowler in Australia, to bowl his first over after lunch only. “But nevertheless Siraj bowled with a lot of fire. He has come through the first class and India A tour grinds. He looks like a solid prospect, said Raju. The 26-year-old fast bowler thus became the 298th player to get the Indian cap. There were two debutants in this match with opener Shubnam Gill becoming the 297th player. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

Kim's first trip to Russia came about two months after his second   because of disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.  The sale of luxury goods, including limousines, is banned under U. N. sanctions intended to put pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.  \n  \n  \n\n \n Kim's two limos were noted upon when he arrived at Vladivostok station — a Mercedes Maybach S600 Pullman Guard and a Mercedes Maybach S62. He is believed to have also used the S600 Pullman Guard for his summits with Trump in Singapore in June last year and in Hanoi in February. The vehicles likely cost more than $1 million each when they were purchased,   to Business Insider.  \"We have absolutely no idea how those vehicles were delivered to North Korea,\" Daimler spokeswoman Silke Mockert said in a written response to an Associated Press report Wednesday on the limousines. \"For Daimler, the correct export of products in conformance with the law is a fundamental principle of responsible entrepreneurial activity.\" \n\n    \n           The S600 Pullman Guard is 21 feet long and has a 517-horsepower, 5.5-liter, bi-turbo V12 engine, according to  . The vehicle's powerful engine allows its occupants \"to get out of a danger zone rapidly\" and offers \"demanding passengers effective protection from terrorist attacks,\" the company states on its website. That protection includes armor designed to withstand small-arms fire as well as fragments from grenades and other explosives; tires that work even when flat; a fuel tank that seals itself if hit by shrapnel; a fire-extinguishing system; and a \"panic system\" that sounds an alarm and lets passengers communicate with people outside the car via an intercom. Among the Pullman Guard's other features: back-massaging  rear seats, electric window blinds, a refrigerator and infrared headlights.  \n     The Maybach S62, which is 20 feet long, was introduced in 2002 as a rival to the Rolls-Royce Phantom. Daimler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, is one of the world's biggest and more prestigious automobile companies. It is one of the biggest providers of high-end passenger cars and the world's largest producer of trucks above 6 tons. North Korea On its home page, the multinational giant boasts of selling vehicles and services in nearly all the countries of the world and of having production facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. North Korea, however, isn't one of its official customers. \"Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with E.U. and U.S. embargoes,\" she said. \"To prevent deliveries to North Korea and to any of its embassies worldwide, Daimler has implemented a comprehensive export control process. Sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility.\" Kim's ability to procure the limousines anyway is a good example of how porous the international sanctions tend to be. According to Daimler, the Mercedes-Benz Pullman limousines offer their passengers \"a superbly appointed setting for discreet meetings.\" \n     The version used by Kim is believed to be equipped with all the key communications and entertainment systems so that, according to a company description of the car, its occupants can remain \"fully in touch with the rest of the world while enjoying the luxury and comfort of their own very special place in it.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/bff778e6-c079-4b34-982b-40cce8ec2913/thumbnail/620x391/7e678319120e11f13db2240052d80f01/rtx6t7pr.jpg#\" alt=\"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrives for a wreath laying ceremony at a navy memorial in Vladivostok \" height=\"391\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/bff778e6-c079-4b34-982b-40cce8ec2913/thumbnail/620x391/7e678319120e11f13db2240052d80f01/rtx6t7pr.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/bff778e6-c079-4b34-982b-40cce8ec2913/thumbnail/1240x782/18b04f427a11b4ea28fd6745c8460c85/rtx6t7pr.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20391'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104059", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Researchers inserted a human brain gene into monkeys, in an experiment with the potential to cross the wires of human and animal intelligence. \n      published last month in Beijing's National Science Review journal describes the experiment, which is billed as the \"first attempt to experimentally interrogate the genetic basis of human brain origin using a transgenic monkey model, and it values the use of nonhuman primates in understanding human unique traits.\" The researchers inserted copies of the human MCPH1 gene, which is crucial for brain development, into 11 monkey embryos through a virus that carried the gene. Six of the monkeys died. The other five, though, showed apparent strides in their cognitive functions. \n  \n  \n\n \n According to the study, those five monkeys did not show much difference in their general behavior or the size of their brains. But they went through brain scans and memory tests that showed improvements in their short-term memory, reaction times and brain development. The study says the monkeys have \"potential to provide important—and potentially unique—insights into basic questions of what actually makes human unique, as well as into disorders and clinically relevant phenotypes, such as neurodegenerative and social behavior disorders that are difficult to study by other means.\" But the study also set off a debate about genetically modifying animals, and whether experiments like this could lead to even more extreme modifications. It also raised questions about what would happen to animals who have human-like intelligence, since they are not equipped to survive that way. \"The use of transgenic monkeys to study human genes linked to brain evolution is a very risky road to take,\" James Sikela, a geneticist who has conducted similar studies with primates at the University of Colorado, told the   \"It is a classic slippery slope issue and one that we can expect to recur as this type of research is pursued.\" \n     The geneticist who led the study said he is already working on bigger experiments on human and animal intelligence. Bing Su, a geneticist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, told MIT Technology Review he has been adding a DNA variant called SRGAP2C, which is a crucial link in the emergence of human intelligence, to monkeys. He said the results of those studies have yet to come. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/0c6abc4d-e4b0-4dc1-820f-d85da0314973/thumbnail/640x360/fcaebb043be622d05237686e3a5768c6/termopolio-regio-v-cs3.jpg#\" alt=\"termopolio-regio-v-cs3.jpg \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/0c6abc4d-e4b0-4dc1-820f-d85da0314973/thumbnail/640x360/fcaebb043be622d05237686e3a5768c6/termopolio-regio-v-cs3.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/0c6abc4d-e4b0-4dc1-820f-d85da0314973/thumbnail/1280x720/5ea0f219912dd44377287db742073bc1/termopolio-regio-v-cs3.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104100", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

But their fight isn't over. The group behind the protests says they are moving on to the next phase of their \"rebellion.\" \n     Activists camped on the edge of London's Hyde Park for 10 days as they took action across the U.K. capital, including gluing themselves to trains, blocking major intersections and shutting down shopping areas. \"I don't go to many marches, this isn't really normal for me, but this one is the most important thing that anyone could ever do,\" a woman carrying an infant told CBS News as she marched past Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. \n  \n  \n\n \n The group behind the demonstrations, Extinction Rebellion, operates out of an upscale office building in central London. Organizers say they use the space rent-free, because the corporate landlord is sympathetic to their cause. Volunteers work on laptops, and signs and fliers are scattered around. The symbol of the group is graffitied over nearly every wall. \"I think about how to effectively change society in a crisis. That's why Extinction Rebellion has been successful,\" said Roger Hallam, who co-founded the group and has been researching effective protest movements for a PhD. \"It's not like three people in a pub going 'let's have a rebellion.' It's like a systematic survey of the academic literature on how societies change radically in a short amount of time,\" he said. \"People need to break the law nonviolently, en masse, preferably in a capital city.\" \n     So that's what the group has been doing -- staging almost daily actions that, according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan, have presented a \"huge challenge\" for London's \"over-stretched and under-resourced\" police.  But Hallam said straining resources is insignificant compared to the threat posed by climate change. \"The theater is on fire,\" Hallam said.  The group is now planning its next steps.  \"The government is guilty of criminal inactivity on climate change. Period,\" Hallam said.  \n\n    \n           Extinction Rebellion protests over the last two weeks coincided with a visit from 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, who visited the U.K. on Tuesday to speak to lawmakers.

As per the University of Warwick research, the atmosphere of the planet, Kepler-438b, is thought to have been stripped away as a result of radiation emitted from a superflaring Red Dwarf star, Kepler-438. Regularly occurring every few hundred days, the superflares are approximately ten times more powerful than those ever recorded on the Sun and equivalent to the same energy as 100 billion megatons of TNT. While superflares themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on Kepler-438b's atmosphere, a dangerous phenomenon associated with powerful flares, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has the potential to strip away any atmosphere and render it uninhabitable. The planet Kepler-438b, to date the exoplanet with the highest recorded Earth Similarity Index, is both similar in size and temperature to the Earth but is in closer proximity to the Red Dwarf than the Earth is to the Sun. Lead researcher David Armstrong explained that if the planet, Kepler-438b, has a magnetic field like the Earth, it may be shielded from some of the effects, but if it does not, or the flares are strong enough, it could have lost its atmosphere, be irradiated by extra dangerous radiation and be a much harsher place for life to exist. The study appears in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104059", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

He also said they were in good position in the first two days of the pink-ball Test. “We had two good days but had just one bad hour where we lost completely. The talk in the dressing room was about backing ourselves as an individual and as a team and stick to the plan whatever it is,” he added on the eve of the second Test. However, Kohli’s departure weakened the Indian batting a bit in trouble and Rahane conceded that they would miss their skipper. There were suggestions to promote himself to No.4 but the middle-order batsman said they have not decided anything yet. “Openers role is crucial but I don’t want to put pressure on them. Just want to give them freedom to play. We will definitely miss Virat. When you have a player like him, it is great for the team.” \nIndia looked in a good position with Kohli and Rahane batting well in the first innings before Kohli was run out. Speaking about the incident, he revealed the momentum shifted in hosts’ favour. “It was a tough one. We were going really well. I saw the momentum going in Australia’s way after the run out. After the end of play, I said sorry to him (Kohli) and he was ok with it. He understood the situation. Such things happen and you have to respect that and move forward.” He further informed that Kohli had a message for the team before heading to India. “He spoke to all of us before leaving. We had a team dinner in Adelaide. He spoke about playing to our strength. We have been playing well. We have to help each other and enjoy each other’s success.” The bowling department will be without Mohammad Shami, who was injured and ruled out of the remainder of the series but the 32-year-old said they are capable of delivering the goods. “Bumrah is a quality bowler and he has been doing really well. Apart from that, Umesh (Yadav) and a guy who will play (Mohammad Siraj), it is about bowling in partnerships. We have discussed how to go about it. It is about bowling in partnerships and bowling towards the plan.” When asked about Australia coach Justin Langer’s comments where he said Indians were under stress after the loss, Rahane added, “Australians are very good at playing mind games. Let them do that. We are focusing on ourselves on what we need to do. We will back ourselves and be positive,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route. A clarification on the non-applicability of the new FDI measure would be critical for them to continue making massive investments in India,\" it added.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104101", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

National security adviser Robert O’Brien said late Thursday that he wants to gradually eliminate about half of the 178 staff members of the National Security Council over the next 15 months. O’Brien, who recently took over after national security adviser John Bolton was ousted by the president, portrayed the cuts as an effort to return to staffing levels of the past. He told NSC employees at a town hall meeting that the size of the staff grew to more than 200 under the Obama administration and that he wants to return it to the level it was under President George W. Bush and have about 100 people by the end of January. “It just ballooned into a massive, you know, bureaucracy … under the last administration,” he said in an interview later on the Fox Business Network program “Lou Dobbs Tonight.” Trump has also complained about the unidentified whistleblower and people in the NSC who apparently provided that person with information about a July 25 phone call he had with the Ukrainian president in which he pressed for an investigation of a political rival while his administration was delaying badly needed military aid to the Eastern European nation. The complaint is now the central focus of the impeachment inquiry. A senior administration official said Friday that the cuts were not related to the leaks and that the NSC would reduce employees through attrition by not replacing people as they finish their assignments at the White House. A former staffer said there are a few areas of NSC that could be trimmed, but that some current staff members already work 60 to 70 hours a week and they worry that the job of providing the president with national security policy options will diminish as the unit shrinks.

There were casualties on both sides and Turkey reported its first military fatality, saying a soldier was “martyred” in the fighting.  Earlier, at least six civilians were killed in Turkey and seven civilians have been killed in Syria since Ankara this week launched the air and ground operation into Syria’s northeast. The invasion came after President Donald Trump opened the way by   from their positions near the border and abandoning U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters. Trump’s unexpected decision came as he faces an impeachment inquiry at home. It drew swift criticism from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, along with many national defense experts who say it’s endangered not only the Syrian Kurds and regional stability but U.S. credibility as well. The Syrian Kurdish militia was the only U.S. ally in the campaign that brought down the Islamic State group in Syria. Trump warned Turkey to act with moderation and safeguard civilians. But the barrages of the invasion so far showed little sign of holding back, and the operation drew widespread criticism. In Syria, residents fled with their belongings loaded into cars, pickup trucks and motorcycle rickshaws, while others escaped on foot. The U.N. refugee agency said tens of thousands were on the move, and aid agencies warned that nearly a half-million people near the border were at risk — in scenes similar to those from a few years ago, when civilians fled the Islamic State group militants. On Friday morning, plumes of black smoke billowed from the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad as Turkey continued bombarding the area. The Turkish ministry statement that reported the death of a soldier also said three soldiers were wounded in the action but didn’t provide details. Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said a total of 342 “terrorists” — Ankara’s parlance for Syrian Kurdish militiamen — were killed in the incursion so far. Those figures could not be independently verified. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish fighters terrorists linked to a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey and says the offensive is necessary for its own national security. \n Turkish officials said the Kurdish militia has fired dozens of mortars into Turkish border towns the past two days, including Akcakale, killing six civilians, including a 9-month-old boy and three girls under 15. On the Syrian side, seven civilians and eight Kurdish fighters have been killed since the operation began, according to activists in Syria. Mourners in the Turkish town of Akcakale carried the coffin Friday of the slain baby boy, Mohammed Omar Saar, as many shouted, “Damn the PKK,” in reference to the Kurdish insurgent group in Turkey that Ankara says is linked to Syrian Kurdish fighters. The Turkish Defense Ministry said the offensive was progressing “successfully as planned.” On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he’s worried the Turkish invasion in Syria could unleash the Islamic State group again. Speaking during a visit to Turkmenistan, Putin said he doubts that the Turkish army has enough resources to promptly take control of IS prison camps, saying he fears the captured IS fighters who have been until now held by the Syrian Kurdish militia “could just run away.” “We have to be aware of this and mobilize the resources of our intelligence to undercut this emerging tangible threat,” Putin said. U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish forces had been holding more than 10,000 IS members captured during the war against the extremists in camps and detention centers in this part of Syria. But this week they said they are being forced to abandon some of those positions to fight the Turkish invasion. Separately, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged Ankara to exercise restraint in its incursion though he acknowledged what he said was Turkey’s legitimate security concern about the Syrian Kurdish fighters. In a joint news conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, Stoltenberg also expressed worry that the Turkish offensive may “jeopardize” gains made against the Islamic State group in the war in Syria. Cavusoglu said Turkey expected solidarity from its allies. “It is not enough to say you understand Turkey’s legitimate concerns, we want to see this solidarity in a clear way,” he said. Cavusoglu has said the military intends to move 30 kilometers (19 miles) into northern Syria and that its operation will last until all “terrorists are neutralized.” European Union Council chief Donald Tusk said Turkey’s operation in Syria is of “grave concern.” Abandoning the Kurdish fighters who have been crucial in the fight against IS “is not only a bad idea” but raises many “questions both of a strategic and moral nature,” Tusk said. He said Erdogan’s threat to “open the gates” and let Syrian refugees flood into Europe was “totally out of place,” adding that the EU will never accept “that refugees are weaponized and used to blackmail us.” A French official said Friday that sanctions against Turkey will be “on the table” at next week’s European Union summit, over Ankara’s incursion into Syria. Amélie de Montchalin, the French secretary for European affairs, told France Inter radio that Europe should respond to what she described as a shocking situation against civilians and Europe’s Kurdish allies against IS in Syria. European diplomats in Brussels have responded cautiously to the idea of sanctions on Ankara, though the invasion has met with unanimous criticism. The Turkish assault aims to create a corridor of control along the length of Turkey’s border — a so-called “safe zone” — clearing out the Syrian Kurdish fighters. Such a zone would end the Kurds’ autonomy in the area and put much of their population under Turkish control. Ankara wants to settle 2 million Syrian refugees, mainly Arabs, in the zone. The U.N. refugee agency said tens of thousands of people have fled their homes since Wednesday, while the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group, put the figure at more than 60,000.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104101", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Now, as Turkish troops   and the U.S. abandons its Kurdish allies, there are renewed fears of a prison break in the camp that could give new life to the extremist group. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, who captured much of northeastern Syria from IS with close U.S. military support, are mobilizing to stop the Turkish invasion and say they may not be able to spare enough forces to secure al-Hol, home to tens of thousands of IS-linked women and their children, and other detention camps holding more than 10,000 male militants, including some 2,000 foreign fighters. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who remains at large, called on his supporters last month to attack the camps and set the detainees free. Turkey views the Kurdish fighters as terrorists because of their links to the Kurdish insurgency in its southeast. President Donald Trump moved U.S. troops aside over the weekend to allow for the invasion, and said Turkey would take charge of the IS prisoners, including those Western countries refuse to repatriate out of security concerns. The U.S. is also planning to relocate dozens of the most feared IS prisoners to detention facilities in neighboring Iraq, according to Iraqi officials. The al-Hol camp is some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Turkish border, outside the “safe zone” Turkey plans to set up in northern Syria. But as the fighting worsens, there is a heightened risk that large numbers of detainees could escape. Al-Baghdadi himself was a former prisoner in Iraq, and jail breaks played a major role in the growth of IS after U.S. and Iraqi forces had nearly eliminated an earlier incarnation of the group a decade ago. Dozens of camp residents attacked an exit gate in an apparent escape attempt before Kurdish security forces brought the situation under control, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said Friday. Video from a closed-circuit camera showed security forces chasing women in black robes through the center of the camp. “With increased SDF vulnerability, SDF control of al-Hol is likely to weaken and they will not coordinate with Turkey,” said Lina Khatib, head of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. She said the SDF is already struggling to maintain order and that IS is likely to exploit the chaos unleashed by the Turkish invasion to mobilize prisoners. The Islamic State group lost its last foothold of territory in March, when the Syrian Kurdish forces captured the eastern village of Baghouz with U.S. support. But inside the overcrowded and squalid al-Hol camp, the group’s violent ideology is alive and well, and a new generation is being indoctrinated. The International Committee of the Red Cross says the more than 40,000 children in the camp “have experienced more violence, trauma and displacement in their short life than any of us can imagine.” Female IS members have turned one of their tents into a court administering the group’s harsh interpretation of Islamic law. Last month, they found a 16-year-old girl guilty of apostasy. After the verdict was announced, women pulled knives from their all-enveloping black robes and stabbed her repeatedly. Kurdish guards evacuated her to a clinic where she later died, according to Abdul-Qader al-Ofeidly, commander of the Kurdish police force known as Asayish, which guards the camps. It was not clear what her nationality was. He said she was one of several people attacked or killed by fellow detainees. A Syrian man with an amputated leg who moved about on crutches was also stabbed to death by female detainees after being accused of apostasy, the commander said. Al-Hol is home to some 71,400 people, mostly wives, widows and children of IS fighters. They were swept up in the long and grueling military campaign that eventually dismantled the extremists’ self-styled caliphate, which at its height in 2014 stretched across a third of Syria and Iraq. The SDF was a key U.S. ally in that effort and lost more than 11,000 fighters in battles with the extremists. Most of the detainees at al-Hol are Syrian and Iraqi women and children. The stabbings took place in a highly-secured area known as the Annex that is home to some 10,000 hard-line IS supporters from other countries. “Foreign women are trying to impose religious classes on all women in the camp,” al-Ofeidly said. On Oct. 1, police stormed a tent and rescued two women who had been sentenced to die and were about to be stabbed to death, he said, adding that IS supporters fought back with knives and pistols. He said another raid in September uncovered hand grenades and the body of a woman who was killed by other detainees and has yet to be identified. He said the foreign women are the main threat in the camp and echoed calls by Kurdish leaders for the detainees’ home countries to take them back. Western countries, including the United States, have refused to repatriate citizens who traveled to the Middle East to join IS, fearing they may not have enough evidence to convict them in criminal courts. The Kurds have long warned that they cannot hold the prisoners indefinitely, and now say their forces are stretched thin as they send reinforcements to the north. They have also halted operations against IS, which continues to stage attacks in Syria and Iraq. Azadeh Moaveni, an analyst for the Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, visited the camp in late June. She said hard-line detainees were trying to maintain the cruel strictures of the caliphate inside the camp, including by whipping women who were caught smoking and encouraging their own children to beat up the children of those deemed unbelievers. “The foreigner annex of al-Hol has been steadily violent much of the year, partly because it seems to hold a small core of organized and extremely militant women who plot and prey upon others, but also because conditions inside are so deplorable and tense,” said Moaveni, who is also the author of a book about young women who traveled to the region to join IS. Like many other detention camps in Syria and Iraq, al-Hol is overcrowded and reliant on international aid. Sewage runs through the muddy alleys, food is sometimes scarce and the water used for drinking and cleaning is contaminated. Robert Onus, the emergency manager in Syria for Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said the Oct. 1 shooting occurred after guards forcefully dispersed a protest over camp conditions held by women and children. He said MSF treated four women with gunshot wounds in the clinic it runs in the Annex, and that medics and patients took shelter from the gunfire. “We are extremely worried about the well-being of the people held in the camp,” Onus said. He said MSF was forced to temporarily reduce its activities and that other aid groups were struggling to deliver much-needed assistance to a “very vulnerable population.” Aid groups have warned that conditions in the camps could get even worse with the Turkish offensive, which has already caused tens of thousands of people to flee, including many who were displaced by earlier rounds of fighting.

He also said they were in good position in the first two days of the pink-ball Test. “We had two good days but had just one bad hour where we lost completely. The talk in the dressing room was about backing ourselves as an individual and as a team and stick to the plan whatever it is,” he added on the eve of the second Test. However, Kohli’s departure weakened the Indian batting a bit in trouble and Rahane conceded that they would miss their skipper. There were suggestions to promote himself to No.4 but the middle-order batsman said they have not decided anything yet. “Openers role is crucial but I don’t want to put pressure on them. Just want to give them freedom to play. We will definitely miss Virat. When you have a player like him, it is great for the team.” \nIndia looked in a good position with Kohli and Rahane batting well in the first innings before Kohli was run out. Speaking about the incident, he revealed the momentum shifted in hosts’ favour. “It was a tough one. We were going really well. I saw the momentum going in Australia’s way after the run out. After the end of play, I said sorry to him (Kohli) and he was ok with it. He understood the situation. Such things happen and you have to respect that and move forward.” He further informed that Kohli had a message for the team before heading to India. “He spoke to all of us before leaving. We had a team dinner in Adelaide. He spoke about playing to our strength. We have been playing well. We have to help each other and enjoy each other’s success.” The bowling department will be without Mohammad Shami, who was injured and ruled out of the remainder of the series but the 32-year-old said they are capable of delivering the goods. “Bumrah is a quality bowler and he has been doing really well. Apart from that, Umesh (Yadav) and a guy who will play (Mohammad Siraj), it is about bowling in partnerships. We have discussed how to go about it. It is about bowling in partnerships and bowling towards the plan.” When asked about Australia coach Justin Langer’s comments where he said Indians were under stress after the loss, Rahane added, “Australians are very good at playing mind games. Let them do that. We are focusing on ourselves on what we need to do. We will back ourselves and be positive,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

But it's likely that climate change itself already is responsible for keeping some of those countries poor, according to new research from two Stanford University climate scientists.\"We find very high likelihood that anthropogenic [human-caused] climate change has increased economic inequality between countries,\" reads the  , which is titled \"Global warming has increased global economic inequality.\" \n     Climate change has been shown to change economic growth, but its effect varies by latitude. In colder countries, such as those in northern and western Europe, per capita economic output grows slightly faster when the weather is warmer than normal. In warmer countries, hotter-than-normal temperatures slow down growth. Unusually high temperatures make workers less productive and reduce agricultural output. They also lead to worse health outcomes for residents, which itself has an economic impact.  Thanks to climate change, India's per capita economic output is today 30 percent lower than it would be otherwise, while Norway's is 34 percent higher, the paper found. That means \"in addition to not sharing equally in the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many poor countries have been significantly harmed by the warming arising from wealthy countries' energy consumption,\" according to the authors. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"We're not arguing global warming created inequality between rich and poor countries,\" emphasized Noah Diffenbaugh, one of the study's authors and a professor at Stanford's Woods Institute for the Environment. In the last half century, the gap between wealthy countries and poorer countries has shrunk dramatically. However, this economic inequality \"has declined more slowly than if global warming had not occurred,\" Diffenbaugh said.   In the future, the authors note, \"although some wealthy countries in  cooler regions could benefit from additional warming, most poor  countries are likely to suffer.\"  Claire Ullman, a political science professor at Barnard University who was not involved in the study, observed that \"the report confirms what we basically already know--the countries that will be hardest hit are those which have done the least to contribute to the problem.\"  Ullman, who studies social policy, noted that even though wealthier countries may suffer less direct damage from climate change, the social upheaval that it causes will ultimately threaten everyone.  \n     \"We wouldn't have a migrant problem at our border in the U.S. if it weren't for climate change. [These are] desperate people fleeing places [in Central America] where the crops have dried up and aren't yielding anymore.\" The U.S., whose vast size gives it a diversity of climate types, is likely to feel both ends of that prediction. The large, wealthy cities that drive much of its economy — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas and Miami — are seeing more and more extreme storms, floods and wildfires, all of which are made worse by a warming climate and causing more expensive property and infrastructure damage.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond last year warned that runaway   off the U.S.' GDP growth by the end of the century.  Meanwhile northern cities like Duluth, Minnesota, and Buffalo, New York, are   themselves as attractive destinations for those fleeing warmer regions.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/29/f4b52dcf-1c12-4048-b720-3b1b12f92395/thumbnail/640x360g3/0b49e09e5fd1562de47e0d1426323bc9/gettyimages-1229343901.jpg#\" alt=\"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Holds Weekly News Conference \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/29/f4b52dcf-1c12-4048-b720-3b1b12f92395/thumbnail/640x360g3/0b49e09e5fd1562de47e0d1426323bc9/gettyimages-1229343901.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/29/f4b52dcf-1c12-4048-b720-3b1b12f92395/thumbnail/1280x720g3/a02a0bc0151a957bc18b5b1ab2421b41/gettyimages-1229343901.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104100", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

As per the University of Warwick research, the atmosphere of the planet, Kepler-438b, is thought to have been stripped away as a result of radiation emitted from a superflaring Red Dwarf star, Kepler-438. Regularly occurring every few hundred days, the superflares are approximately ten times more powerful than those ever recorded on the Sun and equivalent to the same energy as 100 billion megatons of TNT. While superflares themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on Kepler-438b's atmosphere, a dangerous phenomenon associated with powerful flares, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has the potential to strip away any atmosphere and render it uninhabitable. The planet Kepler-438b, to date the exoplanet with the highest recorded Earth Similarity Index, is both similar in size and temperature to the Earth but is in closer proximity to the Red Dwarf than the Earth is to the Sun. Lead researcher David Armstrong explained that if the planet, Kepler-438b, has a magnetic field like the Earth, it may be shielded from some of the effects, but if it does not, or the flares are strong enough, it could have lost its atmosphere, be irradiated by extra dangerous radiation and be a much harsher place for life to exist.

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104101", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

If the humiliation of getting bundled out for 36 wasn’t enough, India was handed a confidence-denting blow when pacer Mohammad Shami was ruled out of the remaining series with a fractured arm. Not to forget the departure of regular skipper and batting mainstay Virat Kohli as he was granted paternity leave by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). After India dominated the first two days of the opening Test, it took a once in a lifetime spell of pace bowling from the duo of Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to turn the table in Australia’s favour and that first session on the third afternoon combined with Joe Burns’ unbeaten fifty has given the hosts a huge confidence booster. The Indians on the other hand saw their chances of registering a win in the first game vanish in minutes. Now India and Australia are dealing with contrasting feelings as they head into the Boxing Day Test. India, who are without the services of their highest run-scorer (Kohli), now faces a problem with an unstable batting order as none managed to stand up in the second innings and deliver against the Australian attack. Prithvi Shaw looked out of place as he was dismissed in similar fashion — gap between bat and pad — in both the innings and while Shubman Gill is likely to be included in the playing XI for the second Test, it remains to be seen if he will replace Shaw or come in for Kohli. The right-handed batsman had hit the nets on Wednesday while Shaw worked with the support staff. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant too could find a place in the playing XI after first-choice wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha failed to deliver in the first Test. But it would be a little unfair to change the keeper for his failure with the bat. This is a call that stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane will have to make. Ravichandran Ashwin, who stole the show in the first Test, has cemented his place and India may go ahead with a twin spin combination if all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is fit to play. Another question that has troubled the visitors is who will replace injured Shami. T Natarajan has impressed everyone with his bowling skills in the limited-over format but Mohammad Siraj and Navdeep Saini are likely to move in as they are part of the Test squad. On the other hand, Australia will be riding on the back of a come-from-behind win in the first Test. While the win helped them maintain their 100 per cent win record in pink-ball Tests, Australia has emerged victorious seven times in their last ten outings in a Boxing Day Test and they would surely want to make that 8 in 11. Overall, the team from Down Under has won 25 matches from 39 games and pose a major threat to opponents when it comes to playing in Melbourne. Steve Smith, who had always dreamt of batting in the Boxing Day Test, has a great record in Australian cricket’s biggest annual event. The right-handed batsman has smashed over 900 runs with three half-centuries. Smith relished batting in a Boxing Day Test and walking out to bat gives him “shivers down the spine”. “Yeah, ten years it is quite hard to believe. Look it’s been since then, I have grown as a player over that time. My Boxing Day record is probably the best in Australia among all grounds. I like batting at MCG,” Smith said in a virtual press conference on Tuesday. It will be interesting to see if he can continue striking gold in the Boxing Day Test or if the Indian bowlers manage to break the spree. Australia coach Justin Langer has said that he is looking at fielding the same XI for the second Test and that clearly means the Indian batsmen have their task cut out when it comes to handling the hosts’ in-form pacers. The only silver lining in an otherwise dark cloud for India is the psychological advantage visitors enjoy over Australia. India had defeated Australia in the 2018 Boxing Day Test by 137 runs. : Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (captain), Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper), Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, R.

National security adviser Robert O’Brien said late Thursday that he wants to gradually eliminate about half of the 178 staff members of the National Security Council over the next 15 months. O’Brien, who recently took over after national security adviser John Bolton was ousted by the president, portrayed the cuts as an effort to return to staffing levels of the past. He told NSC employees at a town hall meeting that the size of the staff grew to more than 200 under the Obama administration and that he wants to return it to the level it was under President George W. Bush and have about 100 people by the end of January. “It just ballooned into a massive, you know, bureaucracy … under the last administration,” he said in an interview later on the Fox Business Network program “Lou Dobbs Tonight.” Trump has also complained about the unidentified whistleblower and people in the NSC who apparently provided that person with information about a July 25 phone call he had with the Ukrainian president in which he pressed for an investigation of a political rival while his administration was delaying badly needed military aid to the Eastern European nation. The complaint is now the central focus of the impeachment inquiry. A senior administration official said Friday that the cuts were not related to the leaks and that the NSC would reduce employees through attrition by not replacing people as they finish their assignments at the White House. A former staffer said there are a few areas of NSC that could be trimmed, but that some current staff members already work 60 to 70 hours a week and they worry that the job of providing the president with national security policy options will diminish as the unit shrinks.

The research could pave the way for many more efficient and greener chemical processes, including the procedure known as carbon capture -trapping carbon dioxide from major sources, for example a fossil-fuel power plant, and storing it to prevent its entry into the atmosphere. \"Materials which contain permanent holes, or pores, are technologically important. They are used for manufacturing a range of products from plastic bottles to petrol,\" said Stuart James of Queen's School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. \"However, until recently, these porous materials have been solids.

This \"digital patch\" is the first new effective treatment for lazy eye in half a century, researchers from the Glick Eye Institute at Indiana University said. Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, remains the most common cause of visual impairment in children. Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not develop normally during early childhood. This can occur when one eye is much more nearsighted than the other, or when one eye wanders or strays inward. The child needs to receive treatment by the age of 8 or so while their eyes and brain are still developing, or he or she could become blind in the weaker eye. A recent study found that 1 in 4 kids feel anxiety before using eye drops. Nearly 15 percent refuse to take eye drops at all. Both drops and eye patches work based on the occlusion method. This blocks vision in the eye with the best sight, forcing the brain to rely on the so-called lazy eye. During the process, vision improves though many children will still need glasses to correct their eyesight. In comparison, the electronic glasses used in the study combine vision correction and occlusion. The lenses can be filled to a child's vision prescription. Because the lenses are liquid crystal display (LCD), they can also be programmed to turn opaque, occluding vision in the left or right eye for different time intervals, acting like a digital patch that flickers on and off. Researchers recently tested the effectiveness of occlusion glasses compared to patching in a randomised clinical study. They recruited 33 subjects with lazy eye between age 3 and 8 who wore spectacles to correct their vision. One group wore an adhesive patch for two hours daily. The other wore Amblyz occlusion glasses for 4 hours daily. In the study, the lens over the eye with better vision switched from clear to opaque every 30 seconds. After three months, both groups of children showed the same amount of improvement in the lazy eye, gaining two lines on a reading chart. \"When you talk to adults who underwent childhood treatment for amblyopia, they will tell you that wearing a patch was the worst thing ever,\" said Daniel Neely, a paediatric ophthalmology professor at Indiana University who led the study. \"With these electronic occlusion glasses, the child learns that the lens will be clear again in just a few seconds so they may be more cooperative with the treatment. For parents who have struggled with drops and patching, this could be a great alternative,\" said Neely.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104102", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104102", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.

In her first interview about the terrifying ordeal,   opened up about how she found humanity in the four men who took her and her tour guide hostage and their days-long journey before a ransom payment secured their release. For days, Endicott and her guide JP Mirenge Remezo had been walking with their captors across the Ugandan border to the more unstable Democratic Republic of Congo. \"And then the sun is setting and we keep walking and it gets to complete, like, pitch darkness,\" she recalled. \"So at one point we stopped. And I look up in the sky and I see the most beautiful sky I've ever seen in my life.\" Even in captivity, Endicott remembered how \"incredible\" the sight was. She used it to connect with the people who took her.  \"It's nothing like I've ever seen before. And that was when I became very aware of humanizing myself to them ... I said, 'Look at the sky.' I said, 'We don't have this at home.'\"  She even pointed out the Milky Way to the men. She said it became her \"mission\" to be human with them so that not only would they see her humanity but it would help her see theirs, too.  \"I remember laying down on the ground and I remember hearing JP say, 'Oh my God,' at my exhaustion. I don't know how long I laid there,\" Endicott said. \"At one point I'm asked to get up. And I turn and look and they've made a tent for me out of tarps and a mosquito net, which, I remember that was the moment where I thought, 'Why are they taking such good care of me?'\" Endicott said a \"relationship\" of sorts began with the young men in the camp.  \"I just start talking to them like I'm talking to you,\" Endicott told King. \"But all the while I'm watching these young men drink water, not from the river, but from a hole in the ground. But they have bottled water for me.\" \n\n           She ended up feeling compassion for the men, saying, \"How could I not?\" \"'Cause that's their life. It's not really above living like an animal. That's their life. If I survive this, I have a life to go back to. That's their life,\" Endicott said. \"That does not condone what they did. Not even close.\"  While a search effort was underway, the kidnappers began making calls to the tour company demanding a ransom and giving JP and Kimberly the phone at points in the negotiations. \"I was able to call my daughter once. They let me do that ... My daughter's besides herself,\" she said. \"Her mother's been kidnapped. But I'm not beside myself. I'm saying, 'Okay we can't, like, we can't do this now. Let's get it together. But tell everybody what's happening. Tell everyone what's happening. Because I don't know what's being done.\" Following five days of negotiations, a ransom was finally paid but it has never been clear where the money came from or how much it was. Once they were free, it was reported across the world.  According to Endicott, it was a woman from the Ugandan Wildlife Authority who met her captors to hand over the money. After that, the same woman and a man with a motorcycle then took the two freed captives to safety.  \"When we pulled into Ishasha Camp I realized just what my government did for me. And I was overcome with shame for thinking they didn't do anything. And gratitude like I've never felt in my life,\" she said.  Even in captivity, Endicott said she was able to find humanity in the men who took her and said they were also her \"protectors.\" \"They could've sold me to a different group. When I went out in the open they had guns that also protected me. It could've been so much worse than it was,\" she said.   Endicott has been back in the states just over two weeks now, but those five days in early April still haunt her. She said she still relives the experience, but a little less every day.   \"Certain things will trigger me. We went for a walk out at a nature area and it just triggered me like nobody's business. The sound of our feet on the ground, pushing bushes out of my way – and so i'm getting in touch with that there's gonna be that probably for a while,\" she said.  Despite what she went through, Endicott believes Uganda is a safe place to visit, that she was the exception to the rule.   \"That was the other thing. That feeling of what this is gonna do to that country that is run by their people and those are immensely friendly, accommodating people. And everyone in hospitality after you would have a conversation, the last thing they said to you was, 'please tell all of your friends to come.'\"  \"So when all of this is said and done do you just look at this as a rag-tag team of people?\" King asked, to which she replied, \"100 percent.\"  \"Hopefully something beautiful is going to come out of this. That's where I have to hold my hope.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg#\" alt=\"promocbsn.jpg \" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg 1x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104103", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The news came amid a chaotic investigation into the bombing attacks -- and mounting anger over intelligence failures that seem to have allowed the terrorists to strike in spite of warnings. \"What intelligence agencies have told me is that Zahran was killed during the Shangri-La attack,\" President Maithripala Sirisena told reporters on Friday, referring to Zahran Hashim, leader of a local extremist group known by the acronym NJT. It is one of two domestic groups Sri Lankan officials believe to have been behind the attack -- but they have always said the local militants likely had help from an \"international\" network. \n  \n  \n\n \n Hashim appeared in a video released by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ) shortly after the group  , but his whereabouts after the blasts was not immediately clear. \n\n           Sri Lankan officials made it clear on Thursday that some suspects in the bombings remain at large, and they could still have explosives. Sri Lanka and other countries continued to warn on Friday that more attacks were possible. On Thursday the U.S. Embassy in Colombo warned people in Sri Lanka to avoid religious services in the country amid the ongoing threat. The country's Catholic churches have cancelled Sunday services, and a government minister asked Muslims to stay home for Friday prayers instead of going to mosques. There have been fears of a backlash against Sri Lanka's Muslim minority in the wake of the bombings. Sirisena did not immediately clarify what Hashim's role was in the attack on the Shangri-La, one of at least six bomb blasts that killed over 250 people on Sunday. \n     U.S. Secretary of State Mike   the attack -- at least -- but the extent to which the group actually helped carry it out has remained unclear. \n\n           On Friday, Australia's prime minister said the Sri Lankan militants did have some level of support from ISIS, including helping to identify the targets of the attacks -- which included three churches packed with Easter worshippers and three luxury hotels. ISIS, which seized a vast swathe of Syria and Iraq in 2014, was only recently   in Syria. As CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported from the front lines of the final offensive against ISIS in Syria, the group was never expected to just disappear, even without territory. Instead, analysts said the group would likely disperse and reshape itself into a more traditional, stateless terror organization. The fact that thousands of foreign fighters from Europe, Asia, the Middle East and even the U.S. came to ISIS' self-declared \"caliphate\" to fight for the group and live under its draconian interpretation of Islam has left the world's security agencies with daunting new challenges.  Scores of ISIS militants and their families have been arrested and are detained in Syria and Iraq. Their home countries . But the more immediate risk is battle hardened militants who slip through the security net and make it back to their home countries undetected, or detected but not sufficiently monitored. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday that the Sri Lanka attacks highlight that risk, but it wasn't clear whether Morrison was referring to specific intelligence about the suspects in the attacks, or more generically about the threat of an evolving ISIS. He said ISIS' support for the plot in Sri Lanka included helping to select targets for the attacks. \n     His government, meanwhile, warned travelers that \"terrorists are likely to carry out further attacks in Sri Lanka.\" The updated travel advice on an Australian government website said Friday that, \"attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreigners.\" The president of Sri Lanka has said he was kept entirely in the dark about intelligence warnings.  Senior Sri Lankan police were handed intelligence from India's government warning that extremists might try to carry out bombing attacks in the run up to Easter, but President Maithripala Sirisena told reporters on Friday that he was never informed, and he blamed his government's inaction on the country's police chief and defense secretary, who resigned on Thursday. \n\n           Sirisena insisted that Sri Lanka would be able \"to completely control ISIS activities\" inside the country. From early on in the investigation, Sri Lankan authorities have released incomplete and inaccurate information about the bombings, shaking the nation's confidence in its leaders and drawing promises of a shake-up in the security services. Just days after the attacks, a government minister said Sri Lanka's investigation had shown the bombings were carried out as retribution for the shooting attack on mosques in New Zealand in March. That information has never been corroborated.  On Thursday, Sri Lankan police tweeted a set of photos of apparent suspects in the attacks, asking the public to help locate them for arrest. One of the images was of an American woman, Muslim activist and author Amara Majeed, who has Sri Lankan parents but nothing to do with the attacks in their homeland. \n \"I have this morning been FALSELY identified by the Sri Lankan government as one of the ISIS Easter attackers in Sri Lanka,\" the Baltimore native tweeted on Thursday. \"What a thing to wake up to!\" \n     Sri Lankan police later admitted the mistake and said the photo was used in error. Meanwhile, on Thursday Sri Lankan officials blamed the confusion caused by the coordinated bombing attacks for a dramatic change in the official death toll. At least 253 people are now said to have been killed on Sunday -- but before announcing that toll on Thursday the government had put the figure at 359.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg#\" alt=\"George Blake Holding Coat \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/1280x720/a959f53d248f6fb7dc4ddfff51e2e2b3/blake.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104103", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Kim's first trip to Russia came about two months after his second   because of disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.  The sale of luxury goods, including limousines, is banned under U. N. sanctions intended to put pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.  \n  \n  \n\n \n Kim's two limos were noted upon when he arrived at Vladivostok station — a Mercedes Maybach S600 Pullman Guard and a Mercedes Maybach S62. He is believed to have also used the S600 Pullman Guard for his summits with Trump in Singapore in June last year and in Hanoi in February. The vehicles likely cost more than $1 million each when they were purchased,   to Business Insider.  \"We have absolutely no idea how those vehicles were delivered to North Korea,\" Daimler spokeswoman Silke Mockert said in a written response to an Associated Press report Wednesday on the limousines. \"For Daimler, the correct export of products in conformance with the law is a fundamental principle of responsible entrepreneurial activity.\" \n\n    \n           The S600 Pullman Guard is 21 feet long and has a 517-horsepower, 5.5-liter, bi-turbo V12 engine, according to  . The vehicle's powerful engine allows its occupants \"to get out of a danger zone rapidly\" and offers \"demanding passengers effective protection from terrorist attacks,\" the company states on its website. That protection includes armor designed to withstand small-arms fire as well as fragments from grenades and other explosives; tires that work even when flat; a fuel tank that seals itself if hit by shrapnel; a fire-extinguishing system; and a \"panic system\" that sounds an alarm and lets passengers communicate with people outside the car via an intercom. Among the Pullman Guard's other features: back-massaging  rear seats, electric window blinds, a refrigerator and infrared headlights.  \n     The Maybach S62, which is 20 feet long, was introduced in 2002 as a rival to the Rolls-Royce Phantom. Daimler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, is one of the world's biggest and more prestigious automobile companies. It is one of the biggest providers of high-end passenger cars and the world's largest producer of trucks above 6 tons. North Korea On its home page, the multinational giant boasts of selling vehicles and services in nearly all the countries of the world and of having production facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. North Korea, however, isn't one of its official customers. \"Our company has had no business connections with North Korea for far more than 15 years now and strictly complies with E.U. and U.S. embargoes,\" she said. \"To prevent deliveries to North Korea and to any of its embassies worldwide, Daimler has implemented a comprehensive export control process. Sales of vehicles by third parties, especially of used vehicles, are beyond our control and responsibility.\" Kim's ability to procure the limousines anyway is a good example of how porous the international sanctions tend to be. According to Daimler, the Mercedes-Benz Pullman limousines offer their passengers \"a superbly appointed setting for discreet meetings.\" \n     The version used by Kim is believed to be equipped with all the key communications and entertainment systems so that, according to a company description of the car, its occupants can remain \"fully in touch with the rest of the world while enjoying the luxury and comfort of their own very special place in it.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/bff778e6-c079-4b34-982b-40cce8ec2913/thumbnail/620x391/7e678319120e11f13db2240052d80f01/rtx6t7pr.jpg#\" alt=\"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrives for a wreath laying ceremony at a navy memorial in Vladivostok \" height=\"391\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/bff778e6-c079-4b34-982b-40cce8ec2913/thumbnail/620x391/7e678319120e11f13db2240052d80f01/rtx6t7pr.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/26/bff778e6-c079-4b34-982b-40cce8ec2913/thumbnail/1240x782/18b04f427a11b4ea28fd6745c8460c85/rtx6t7pr.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20391'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104103", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Washington is “greatly disappointed” by the Turkish incursion, Esper told a Pentagon news conference. He said it has badly damaged already frayed relations with Turkey, a NATO ally ousted from a Pentagon fighter jet program in July for refusing to drop its purchase of a Russian air defense system that is incompatible with NATO. Many have called President Donald Trump’s decision Sunday to pull a small number of U.S. troops away from the Turkish border a grave mistake. Even some of his staunchest Republican supporters have sharply criticized the decision and urged him to reconsider. Some regard it as a betrayal of the U.S.-armed Kurdish fighters who have, at great cost, partnered with U.S. forces against the Islamic State group since 2015. Esper insisted the Kurds remain a viable partner. “To be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces, and U.S. troops remain with them in other parts of Syria. The impulsive action of President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation,” Esper said. The Turkish invasion also has raised the prospect of losing control of thousands of captured Islamic State fighters. Esper called on the Turks to halt their operation, but he told reporters that he has no indication they are willing to do so. He lamented “the dramatic harm” done to the two nations’ relationship. Speaking alongside Esper, Gen. Mark Milley said the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish military known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is still guarding camps holding IS prisoners. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Turkish military operations across the border into Syria are still “relatively limited.” He said the operations have been carried out near two Syrian villages by about 1,000 members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army and hundreds of Turkish commando forces. The distance they have penetrated into Syria ranges from a kilometer or two (about 1 mile) in one area to about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) in another. Milley emphasized that U.S. forces are still working with Kurdish forces. He said U.S. policy is to continue with a counter-ISIS campaign except in one area of the incursion. He said the Turks “know exactly where American forces are” throughout Syria and in the invasion zone. They have been told that U.S. troops will defend themselves if needed, he said. Milley said leaders of the Kurdish force have told some of their fighters to move north to defend what they consider to be their territory. But he said the U.S. is “encouraging them to not overreact at this point and to try to tamp things down in order to allow some sort of diplomatic resolution.” Esper’s remarks were the Pentagon’s most explicit criticism of the Turkish operation, which began Wednesday as a campaign against the Syrian Kurd-led militia that has partnered with U.S. forces over the past five years to fight the Islamic State. President Donald Trump has called the invasion a “bad idea” and held out the possibility of the U.S. mediating a settlement. A senior Turkish official in Washington suggested that the U.S. mediation offer would not be welcomed in Ankara due to Turkey’s opposition to negotiating with terrorists. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said previous efforts to broker deals with the Kurds had failed because negotiating “will not change their basic motivation and will not change their tactics.” The official reiterated that Turkey would halt the operation and withdraw its forces only after the border area is cleared of “terrorists” but would not stay in Syria “one more day than is necessary.” The Pentagon had said before the operation began that the U.S. military would not support it, but it had not openly criticized the invasion. The U.S. pulled about 30 special operations troops out of observation posts along the invasion route on the Syrian border. Turkey views elements of the U.S.-backed Syrian militia as terrorists and a border threat. The U.S. has about 1,000 troops in Syria. International aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis, with nearly a half-million people at risk near the border. In a written statement, the chief Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said that in a phone call Thursday with his Turkish counterpart, Esper “made it clear” that the U.S. opposes the incursion. Hoffman said Esper told Defense Minister Hulusi Akar that his government’s military actions “place at risk” the progress made to defeat the extremists, and Esper urged Turkey to stop its incursion. Milley spoke by phone Wednesday with his Turkish counterpart to discuss the security situation in Syria. Details were not released. The Turkish incursion has complicated U.S. military efforts in the region, even as Washington seeks to deter Iran from further attacks on Saudi Arabia following a drone and cruise missile assault in September that damaged key Saudi oil facilities. In response, the U.S. said it as deploying additional air defenses to Saudi Arabia.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104103", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104103", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

This is the question that many people are asking… while several sectors including automobile, real estate, financial services - non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) in particular, and manufacturing have shown signs of impact from this economic slowdown. The start-up ecosystem seems to be holding up the jury is still out on this as these are still early days. In the last few years several start-ups have raised millions. While the valuations game is still not fully understood,and funding continues to be a double-edged sword. While funding is crucial for all types of companies, a well-funded company can create immense value and disrupt markets, mismanagement of funds or over funding can be a recipe for disaster. The Indian start-up environment is highly unforgiving. Failures are not celebrated but looked down on so a failed enterprise entrepreneur will find it difficult to regain investor confidence. Entrepreneurs sometimes lack the understanding as to if he needs to expose himself to fresh funding and what needs to be done. There is a need for start-ups to get access to a good mentor or advisor. Operating in this very environment is what Radar India Advisors does. Radar India Advisors was founded with the objective to be an advisor to these start-ups and also help them with access to funds.

Washington is “greatly disappointed” by the Turkish incursion, Esper told a Pentagon news conference. He said it has badly damaged already frayed relations with Turkey, a NATO ally ousted from a Pentagon fighter jet program in July for refusing to drop its purchase of a Russian air defense system that is incompatible with NATO. Many have called President Donald Trump’s decision Sunday to pull a small number of U.S. troops away from the Turkish border a grave mistake. Even some of his staunchest Republican supporters have sharply criticized the decision and urged him to reconsider. Some regard it as a betrayal of the U.S.-armed Kurdish fighters who have, at great cost, partnered with U.S. forces against the Islamic State group since 2015. Esper insisted the Kurds remain a viable partner. “To be clear, we are not abandoning our Kurdish partner forces, and U.S. troops remain with them in other parts of Syria. The impulsive action of President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation,” Esper said. The Turkish invasion also has raised the prospect of losing control of thousands of captured Islamic State fighters. Esper called on the Turks to halt their operation, but he told reporters that he has no indication they are willing to do so. He lamented “the dramatic harm” done to the two nations’ relationship. Speaking alongside Esper, Gen. Mark Milley said the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish military known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is still guarding camps holding IS prisoners. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Turkish military operations across the border into Syria are still “relatively limited.” He said the operations have been carried out near two Syrian villages by about 1,000 members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army and hundreds of Turkish commando forces. The distance they have penetrated into Syria ranges from a kilometer or two (about 1 mile) in one area to about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) in another. Milley emphasized that U.S. forces are still working with Kurdish forces. He said U.S. policy is to continue with a counter-ISIS campaign except in one area of the incursion. He said the Turks “know exactly where American forces are” throughout Syria and in the invasion zone. They have been told that U.S. troops will defend themselves if needed, he said. Milley said leaders of the Kurdish force have told some of their fighters to move north to defend what they consider to be their territory. But he said the U.S. is “encouraging them to not overreact at this point and to try to tamp things down in order to allow some sort of diplomatic resolution.” Esper’s remarks were the Pentagon’s most explicit criticism of the Turkish operation, which began Wednesday as a campaign against the Syrian Kurd-led militia that has partnered with U.S. forces over the past five years to fight the Islamic State. President Donald Trump has called the invasion a “bad idea” and held out the possibility of the U.S. mediating a settlement. A senior Turkish official in Washington suggested that the U.S. mediation offer would not be welcomed in Ankara due to Turkey’s opposition to negotiating with terrorists. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said previous efforts to broker deals with the Kurds had failed because negotiating “will not change their basic motivation and will not change their tactics.” The official reiterated that Turkey would halt the operation and withdraw its forces only after the border area is cleared of “terrorists” but would not stay in Syria “one more day than is necessary.” The Pentagon had said before the operation began that the U.S. military would not support it, but it had not openly criticized the invasion. The U.S. pulled about 30 special operations troops out of observation posts along the invasion route on the Syrian border. Turkey views elements of the U.S.-backed Syrian militia as terrorists and a border threat. The U.S. has about 1,000 troops in Syria. International aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis, with nearly a half-million people at risk near the border. In a written statement, the chief Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said that in a phone call Thursday with his Turkish counterpart, Esper “made it clear” that the U.S. opposes the incursion. Hoffman said Esper told Defense Minister Hulusi Akar that his government’s military actions “place at risk” the progress made to defeat the extremists, and Esper urged Turkey to stop its incursion. Milley spoke by phone Wednesday with his Turkish counterpart to discuss the security situation in Syria. Details were not released. The Turkish incursion has complicated U.S. military efforts in the region, even as Washington seeks to deter Iran from further attacks on Saudi Arabia following a drone and cruise missile assault in September that damaged key Saudi oil facilities. In response, the U.S. said it as deploying additional air defenses to Saudi Arabia.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104104", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The impulsive action of President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan to invade northern Syria has put the United States in a tough situation,” Esper said. The Turkish invasion also has raised the prospect of losing control of thousands of captured Islamic State fighters. Esper called on the Turks to halt their operation, but he told reporters that he has no indication they are willing to do so. He lamented “the dramatic harm” done to the two nations’ relationship. Speaking alongside Esper, Gen. Mark Milley said the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish military known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is still guarding camps holding IS prisoners. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Turkish military operations across the border into Syria are still “relatively limited.” He said the operations have been carried out near two Syrian villages by about 1,000 members of the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army and hundreds of Turkish commando forces. The distance they have penetrated into Syria ranges from a kilometer or two (about 1 mile) in one area to about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) in another. Milley emphasized that U.S. forces are still working with Kurdish forces. He said U.S. policy is to continue with a counter-ISIS campaign except in one area of the incursion. He said the Turks “know exactly where American forces are” throughout Syria and in the invasion zone. They have been told that U.S. troops will defend themselves if needed, he said. Milley said leaders of the Kurdish force have told some of their fighters to move north to defend what they consider to be their territory. But he said the U.S. is “encouraging them to not overreact at this point and to try to tamp things down in order to allow some sort of diplomatic resolution.” Esper’s remarks were the Pentagon’s most explicit criticism of the Turkish operation, which began Wednesday as a campaign against the Syrian Kurd-led militia that has partnered with U.S. forces over the past five years to fight the Islamic State. President Donald Trump has called the invasion a “bad idea” and held out the possibility of the U.S. mediating a settlement. A senior Turkish official in Washington suggested that the U.S. mediation offer would not be welcomed in Ankara due to Turkey’s opposition to negotiating with terrorists. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, said previous efforts to broker deals with the Kurds had failed because negotiating “will not change their basic motivation and will not change their tactics.” The official reiterated that Turkey would halt the operation and withdraw its forces only after the border area is cleared of “terrorists” but would not stay in Syria “one more day than is necessary.” The Pentagon had said before the operation began that the U.S. military would not support it, but it had not openly criticized the invasion. The U.S. pulled about 30 special operations troops out of observation posts along the invasion route on the Syrian border. Turkey views elements of the U.S.-backed Syrian militia as terrorists and a border threat. The U.S. has about 1,000 troops in Syria. International aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis, with nearly a half-million people at risk near the border. In a written statement, the chief Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said that in a phone call Thursday with his Turkish counterpart, Esper “made it clear” that the U.S. opposes the incursion. Hoffman said Esper told Defense Minister Hulusi Akar that his government’s military actions “place at risk” the progress made to defeat the extremists, and Esper urged Turkey to stop its incursion. Milley spoke by phone Wednesday with his Turkish counterpart to discuss the security situation in Syria. Details were not released. The Turkish incursion has complicated U.S. military efforts in the region, even as Washington seeks to deter Iran from further attacks on Saudi Arabia following a drone and cruise missile assault in September that damaged key Saudi oil facilities. In response, the U.S. said it as deploying additional air defenses to Saudi Arabia.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104105", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

But it's likely that climate change itself already is responsible for keeping some of those countries poor, according to new research from two Stanford University climate scientists.\"We find very high likelihood that anthropogenic [human-caused] climate change has increased economic inequality between countries,\" reads the  , which is titled \"Global warming has increased global economic inequality.\" \n     Climate change has been shown to change economic growth, but its effect varies by latitude. In colder countries, such as those in northern and western Europe, per capita economic output grows slightly faster when the weather is warmer than normal. In warmer countries, hotter-than-normal temperatures slow down growth. Unusually high temperatures make workers less productive and reduce agricultural output. They also lead to worse health outcomes for residents, which itself has an economic impact.  Thanks to climate change, India's per capita economic output is today 30 percent lower than it would be otherwise, while Norway's is 34 percent higher, the paper found. That means \"in addition to not sharing equally in the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many poor countries have been significantly harmed by the warming arising from wealthy countries' energy consumption,\" according to the authors. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"We're not arguing global warming created inequality between rich and poor countries,\" emphasized Noah Diffenbaugh, one of the study's authors and a professor at Stanford's Woods Institute for the Environment. In the last half century, the gap between wealthy countries and poorer countries has shrunk dramatically. However, this economic inequality \"has declined more slowly than if global warming had not occurred,\" Diffenbaugh said.   In the future, the authors note, \"although some wealthy countries in  cooler regions could benefit from additional warming, most poor  countries are likely to suffer.\"  Claire Ullman, a political science professor at Barnard University who was not involved in the study, observed that \"the report confirms what we basically already know--the countries that will be hardest hit are those which have done the least to contribute to the problem.\"  Ullman, who studies social policy, noted that even though wealthier countries may suffer less direct damage from climate change, the social upheaval that it causes will ultimately threaten everyone.  \n     \"We wouldn't have a migrant problem at our border in the U.S. if it weren't for climate change. [These are] desperate people fleeing places [in Central America] where the crops have dried up and aren't yielding anymore.\" The U.S., whose vast size gives it a diversity of climate types, is likely to feel both ends of that prediction. The large, wealthy cities that drive much of its economy — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas and Miami — are seeing more and more extreme storms, floods and wildfires, all of which are made worse by a warming climate and causing more expensive property and infrastructure damage.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond last year warned that runaway   off the U.S.' GDP growth by the end of the century.  Meanwhile northern cities like Duluth, Minnesota, and Buffalo, New York, are   themselves as attractive destinations for those fleeing warmer regions.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/29/f4b52dcf-1c12-4048-b720-3b1b12f92395/thumbnail/640x360g3/0b49e09e5fd1562de47e0d1426323bc9/gettyimages-1229343901.jpg#\" alt=\"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Holds Weekly News Conference \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/29/f4b52dcf-1c12-4048-b720-3b1b12f92395/thumbnail/640x360g3/0b49e09e5fd1562de47e0d1426323bc9/gettyimages-1229343901.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/29/f4b52dcf-1c12-4048-b720-3b1b12f92395/thumbnail/1280x720g3/a02a0bc0151a957bc18b5b1ab2421b41/gettyimages-1229343901.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104104", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Scott Hapgood is charged with killing Kenny Mitchel on the island of Anguilla earlier this month. Anguilla's police department said officers were called to investigate Mitchel's death shortly after 4 p.m. on April 13. The 27-year-old father worked at a luxury resort on the island's west end. An autopsy report shows he died of \"blunt force trauma\" and suffocation. CBS News' Mola Lenghi reports three days later, police charged Hapgood with manslaughter. The 44-year-old was vacationing on the island with his family and staying at the hotel where Mitchel was allegedly employed as a maintenance worker. A spokeswoman for Hapgood said \"the worker showed up unannounced in uniform at the hotel room, claiming he was there to fix a broken sink before carrying out his sudden, violent attack on the family.\" She alleges he \"was armed and demanding money.\" Mitchel's uncle, Victor, said that's not true. \"Kenny was just not a person who'd give anybody problems,\" he said. Hapgood was originally denied bail from prison, but later released on a $74,000 bond following an appeal from his attorney. Local reports say many Anguillans are angry and demanding Hapgood return to the island to face justice. The British territory of nearly 15,000 people often attracts wealthy vacationers. On social media, Anguilla's former head of tourism urged residents not to allow the case to tarnish the island's reputation, adding they continue to \"welcome visitors.\" Hapgood is a financial adviser. He's due back in court in Anguilla in August. His attorney on the island told a local newspaper \"he has every intention to return to Anguilla to clear his name.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg#\" alt=\"promocbsn.jpg \" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg 1x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104105", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Researchers at Queen's University Belfast in UK, along with colleagues at the University of Liverpool and other international partners, invented the new liquid and found that it can dissolve unusually large amount of gas, which are absorbed into the `holes' in the liquid. The research could pave the way for many more efficient and greener chemical processes, including the procedure known as carbon capture -trapping carbon dioxide from major sources, for example a fossil-fuel power plant, and storing it to prevent its entry into the atmosphere. \"Materials which contain permanent holes, or pores, are technologically important. They are used for manufacturing a range of products from plastic bottles to petrol,\" said Stuart James of Queen's School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. \"However, until recently, these porous materials have been solids. What we have done is to design a special liquid from the 'bottom-up' -we designed the shapes of the molecules which make up the liquid so that the liquid could not fill up all the space,\" James said. \"Because of the empty holes we then had in the liquid, we found that it was able to dissolve unusually large amounts of gas,\" he said. \"A few more years' research will be needed, but if we can find applications for these porous liquids they could result in new or improved chemical processes,\" James said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104105", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

This \"digital patch\" is the first new effective treatment for lazy eye in half a century, researchers from the Glick Eye Institute at Indiana University said. Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, remains the most common cause of visual impairment in children. Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not develop normally during early childhood. This can occur when one eye is much more nearsighted than the other, or when one eye wanders or strays inward. The child needs to receive treatment by the age of 8 or so while their eyes and brain are still developing, or he or she could become blind in the weaker eye. A recent study found that 1 in 4 kids feel anxiety before using eye drops. Nearly 15 percent refuse to take eye drops at all. Both drops and eye patches work based on the occlusion method. This blocks vision in the eye with the best sight, forcing the brain to rely on the so-called lazy eye. During the process, vision improves though many children will still need glasses to correct their eyesight. In comparison, the electronic glasses used in the study combine vision correction and occlusion. The lenses can be filled to a child's vision prescription. Because the lenses are liquid crystal display (LCD), they can also be programmed to turn opaque, occluding vision in the left or right eye for different time intervals, acting like a digital patch that flickers on and off. Researchers recently tested the effectiveness of occlusion glasses compared to patching in a randomised clinical study. They recruited 33 subjects with lazy eye between age 3 and 8 who wore spectacles to correct their vision. One group wore an adhesive patch for two hours daily. The other wore Amblyz occlusion glasses for 4 hours daily. In the study, the lens over the eye with better vision switched from clear to opaque every 30 seconds. After three months, both groups of children showed the same amount of improvement in the lazy eye, gaining two lines on a reading chart. \"When you talk to adults who underwent childhood treatment for amblyopia, they will tell you that wearing a patch was the worst thing ever,\" said Daniel Neely, a paediatric ophthalmology professor at Indiana University who led the study. \"With these electronic occlusion glasses, the child learns that the lens will be clear again in just a few seconds so they may be more cooperative with the treatment. For parents who have struggled with drops and patching, this could be a great alternative,\" said Neely.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104105", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Due to Covid-19 pandemic and the recent passing away of Siraj’s father, the celebrations were muted and confined to indoors. But the family members of the fast bowler, who made his Test debut against Australia on Saturday, were excited while they followed the game on the television. The moment Siraj took to the field with his teammates, his mother Shabana Begum’s eyes were filled with tears of joy. Speaking after watching his son don Indian colours, she said her husband’s (Mohammed Ghouse) dream finally fulfilled. “  (It is all the grace of Almighty). Thanks to God, his father would be proud of him today,” she said. When asked about their feeling ahead of his debut, she said, “We got up very early to watch him play. We were excited and happy. But when he took the field and stood there with his teammates singing the national anthem, it brought us tears.” Siraj had a wonderful debut picking up two crucial wickets that helped India skittle out Australia for 195 runs on the first day of the Boxing Day Test. When asked about their feeling after Siraj picked up his first wicket, Shabana said, “We can’t express the feeling. Playing for country has always been his and his father’s dream. Now he made the country proud.” Shabana, who was worried for Siraj for neglecting his studies and focusing on cricket, added she wants her son to win matches for India. Siraj’s grandmother Sardar Bhi said that the family was delighted. “Due to his father’s death, the family mourning will continue for three months. So we told Siraj’s friends not to come to the house for watching the match. We know they are all excited to share their joy with us. But this is a tough time.” “We started getting calls early in the morning when he took those two wickets. We switched off our mobiles and kept it aside to watch the match,” she added. Siraj’s brother Mohammed Ismail said he was over the moon. “I wasn’t feeling well in the morning, so I watched till lunch and slept off. But I have been receiving calls from people congratulating us. It is a great moment for our family,” he added. A long time friend of Siraj, Mohd Shafi said that he is poised for greater things. “I am very happy to see Siraj playing for the country. If his father was here, he would have been very happy. I spoke to his mother, she was also very happy. I spoke to Siraj as well after the first day’s game. He said if people support him, he would do many great things for the country. Siraj revealed that it is just the start and he has been working very hard.” Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

Researchers inserted a human brain gene into monkeys, in an experiment with the potential to cross the wires of human and animal intelligence. \n      published last month in Beijing's National Science Review journal describes the experiment, which is billed as the \"first attempt to experimentally interrogate the genetic basis of human brain origin using a transgenic monkey model, and it values the use of nonhuman primates in understanding human unique traits.\" The researchers inserted copies of the human MCPH1 gene, which is crucial for brain development, into 11 monkey embryos through a virus that carried the gene. Six of the monkeys died. The other five, though, showed apparent strides in their cognitive functions. \n  \n  \n\n \n According to the study, those five monkeys did not show much difference in their general behavior or the size of their brains. But they went through brain scans and memory tests that showed improvements in their short-term memory, reaction times and brain development. The study says the monkeys have \"potential to provide important—and potentially unique—insights into basic questions of what actually makes human unique, as well as into disorders and clinically relevant phenotypes, such as neurodegenerative and social behavior disorders that are difficult to study by other means.\" But the study also set off a debate about genetically modifying animals, and whether experiments like this could lead to even more extreme modifications. It also raised questions about what would happen to animals who have human-like intelligence, since they are not equipped to survive that way. \"The use of transgenic monkeys to study human genes linked to brain evolution is a very risky road to take,\" James Sikela, a geneticist who has conducted similar studies with primates at the University of Colorado, told the   \"It is a classic slippery slope issue and one that we can expect to recur as this type of research is pursued.\" \n     The geneticist who led the study said he is already working on bigger experiments on human and animal intelligence. Bing Su, a geneticist at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, told MIT Technology Review he has been adding a DNA variant called SRGAP2C, which is a crucial link in the emergence of human intelligence, to monkeys. He said the results of those studies have yet to come. ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/0c6abc4d-e4b0-4dc1-820f-d85da0314973/thumbnail/640x360/fcaebb043be622d05237686e3a5768c6/termopolio-regio-v-cs3.jpg#\" alt=\"termopolio-regio-v-cs3.jpg \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/0c6abc4d-e4b0-4dc1-820f-d85da0314973/thumbnail/640x360/fcaebb043be622d05237686e3a5768c6/termopolio-regio-v-cs3.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/0c6abc4d-e4b0-4dc1-820f-d85da0314973/thumbnail/1280x720/5ea0f219912dd44377287db742073bc1/termopolio-regio-v-cs3.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104105", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Norwegian Nobel Institute on Friday also praised the “important reforms” that Abiy, Ethiopia’s leader since April 2018, has launched at home. Chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said some people may consider it too early to give him the prize, but “it is now that Abiy Ahmed’s efforts need recognition and deserve encouragement.” Abiy, 43, took office after widespread protests pressured the longtime ruling coalition and hurt one of the world’s fastest growing economies. Africa’s youngest leader quickly announced dramatic reforms and “Abiymania” began. In a move that caused surprise in the long-turbulent Horn of Africa region, he said Ethiopia would accept a peace agreement with Eritrea, ending one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts. Within weeks, Eritrea’s longtime leader, visibly moved, visited Addis Ababa and communications and transport links were restored. For the first time in two decades people could, long-divided families made tearful reunions. The improving relations led to the lifting of United Nations sanctions on Eritrea, one of the world’s most reclusive nations. But Ethiopia’s reforms appear not to have inspired any in Eritrea, which has since closed border posts with its neighbor. At home, Abiy offered one political surprise after another. He released tens of thousands of prisoners, welcomed home once-banned opposition groups and acknowledged past abuses. People expressed themselves freely on social media, and he announced that Ethiopia would hold free and fair elections in 2020. The country has one of the world’s few “gender-balanced” Cabinets and a female president, a rarity in Africa. And for the first time Ethiopia had no journalists in prison, media groups noted last year. The new prime minister also announced the opening-up of Ethiopia’s tightly controlled economy, saying private investment would be welcome in major state-owned sectors — a process that continues slowly.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104106", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Yet if prize organizers hoped to get through this year’s awards without controversy, they will likely be disappointed. The Swedish Academy called Handke “one of the most influential writers in Europe” and praised his work for exploring “the periphery and the specificity of human experience.” But the 76-year-old author has long faced criticism for his vigorous defense of the Serbs during the 1990s wars that devastated the Balkans as Yugoslavia disintegrated. He spoke at the 2006 funeral of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who at the time was facing war crimes charges, calling him “a rather tragic man.” Handke — who once called for the Nobel Prize to be abolished — said he was “astonished” to receive the literature award. “I never thought they would choose me,” Handke told reporters outside his home in suburban Paris. “It was very courageous by the Swedish academy, this kind of decision,” he added. “These are good people.” If Handke’s victory caused uncomfortable ripples, the choice of Tokarczuk was welcomed by liberal-minded authors and readers in her native Poland and beyond. The 57-year-old novelist, known for her humanist themes and playful, subversive streak, has often irked Poland’s populists and conservatives. The academy said she was chosen for works that explore the “crossing of boundaries as a form of life.” Already a major cultural figure in Poland, Tokarczuk has a growing international profile, especially since she won the Booker International prize in 2018 for the novel “Flights.” She told Polish broadcaster TVN on Thursday that she was “terribly happy and proud” that her novels, which describe events in small towns in Poland “can be read as universal and can be important for people around the world.” Handke has been a big name in European literature for decades, crafting works — starting with his first novel, “The Hornets,” in 1966 — that combine introspection and a provocative streak. One early play was called “Offending the Audience” and featured actors insulting theatergoers. He has written screenplays, several of them for German director Wim Wenders, who also filmed Handke’s 1970 novel, “The Goalie’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick.” He was praised by the Swedish Academy for writing powerfully about catastrophe, notably in “A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,” his 1972 autobiographical novel about his mother’s suicide. But his staunch support of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkans wars has set him at odds with many other Western intellectuals. In a 1996 essay, “Justice for Serbia,” Handke accused Western news media of always depicting Serbs as aggressors. He denied that genocide was committed when Bosnian Serb troops massacred some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in the enclave of Srebrenica in 1995, and was an opponent of NATO’s airstrikes against Serbia for that country’s violent crackdown in Kosovo in the late 1990s. In an interview with Serbia’s state TV earlier this year, Handke said those behind the bombing “don’t belong to Europe and the planet Earth.” Handke’s views led novelist Salman Rushdie in 1999 to call him a contender for “International Moron of the Year.” Rushdie’s publicist at Penguin Random House said Thursday that Rushdie stood by what he wrote in 1999. Novelist Jennifer Egan, president of PEN America, said the writers’ group deeply regretted the choice of Handke. “We are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth and offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide,” she said. “At a moment of rising nationalism, autocratic leadership, and widespread disinformation around the world, the literary community deserves better than this.”  In 2006, Handke turned down the Heinrich Heine award from the German city of Duesseldorf after his selection sparked a row among the city’s politicians. His selection as winner of the International Ibsen Award for drama in 2014 also prompted protests from human rights groups. That same year, he told the Austrian Press Agency that the Nobel Prize should be abolished because of its “false canonization” of literature. Serbian officials and media hailed Handke on Thursday as a “great friend of Serbia,” but Kosovans reacted angrily to his Nobel Prize. Vlora Citaku, Kosovo’s ambassador to the United States, tweeted that “In a world full of brilliant writers, the Nobel committee chooses to reward a propagator of ethnic hatred & violence. Something has gone terribly wrong!” Albanian Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj, who was born in Kosovo, tweeted that the award was “an ignoble & shameful act.” In contrast, the win by Tokarczuk — Poland’s fifth Nobel literature laureate — was greeted with praise even by her erstwhile critics. Tokarcuzk has been attacked by Polish conservatives — and received death threats — for criticizing aspects of the country’s past, including its episodes of anti-Semitism. She is also a strong critic of Poland’s current right-wing government. Her 2014 novel “The Books of Jacob” tackles the forced conversion of Polish Jews to Catholicism in the 18th century. Her book “Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead” is a crime thriller with feminist and animal-rights themes that offers a sometimes unflattering depiction of small-town Polish life. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski, who said earlier this week that he has not finished any of Tokarczuk’s books, tweeted his congratulations and said he now felt obliged to go back and read her books all the way through. Polish President Andrzej Duda called it a “great day for Polish literature.” Tokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the Nobel literature prize in more than a century. Of the 11 Nobels awarded so far this week, all the other laureates have been men. Both literature winners will receive a full cash prize, valued this year at 9 million kronor ($918,000), a gold medal and a diploma at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10. The literature prize was canceled last year after an exodus of members from the exclusive Swedish Academy following sex abuse allegations. Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011. The Nobel Foundation had warned that another group would award the literature prize if the academy didn’t improve its tarnished image, but said in March it was satisfied the Swedish Academy had revamped itself and restored trust. The 2018 and 2019 awards were chosen by the Swedish Academy’s Nobel Committee, a new body made up of four academy members and five “external specialists.” Nobel organizers say the committee suggests two names that then must be approved by the Swedish Academy. It’s unclear whether academy members simply rubber-stamped the experts’ choice. The literature awards follow Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine handed out earlier this week. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday and the economics award on Monday.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104107", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.mydigitalfc.com", "section": "Just In", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.mydigitalfc.com/companies/281219/indian-pharma-sunrise-segment-year-2020-prognosis-positive-for-healthcare-sector.html", "title": "Indian pharma 'sunrise' segment, year 2020 prognosis positive for healthcare sector", "author": "\n                ", "author_link": "", "published_date": "\n                ", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, 'The prognosis is positive.'", "text": " Nourished by increasing spending, improving accessibility and growing exports, India's pharma and healthcare sector is poised for another year of robust growth even as pricing and cost headwinds could force players to pause to catch breath. The next wave of growth could come from increasing exports to large and traditionally under penetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Latin America, which would help the industry meet its aspiration of becoming the world's largest supplier by volume, according to pharma industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). Experts said improved access to medicines in India and exploring new markets while maintaining thrust in the US will help the country's pharma industry to record double-digit growth in the coming year. However, the sector, specially pharmaceuticals, will be up against headwinds of increased costs related to regulatory compliances, particularly for the US market, price controls across markets and mandatory genericisation in India. \"The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is a sunrise industry with a competitive advantage for India. We should leverage India's position by unleashing entrepreneurial spirit through policy stability and ecosystem,\" IPA Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said. The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily. Medical devices makers' body, AdvaMed Vice President Abby Pratt said it would urge the government to promote the adoption of global harmonisation, including internationally recognised standards, that would not only help ensure the quality and efficacy of products but also enable an ecosystem for manufacturing, research, and innovation for benefits of patients in India.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104107", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

More security camera video emerged on Wednesday, showing two of the suspected attackers inside a luxury hotel.  Officials have said there were nine bombers in all, including one woman. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer said a video released by  , shows eight of the purported suicide attackers swearing allegiance to the terror group. But officials are still unclear how much of a role ISIS actually played, beyond inspiring the attack. Sri Lanka's junior defense minister reiterated on Wednesday the government's stance that two relatively unknown local Islamic extremist groups were behind the attack.  Junior minister Ruwan Wijewardene also told reporters that many of the bombers were highly educated and came from well-off families.  \"Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,\" Wijewardene said. \"They are quite well-educated people,\" he said, noting that at least one had a degree in law and that some of them may have lived and studied in the United Kingdom or Australia.    But the man in who stood in the middle of the group shown in the ISIS video -- the only one not hiding his face -- was Moulavi Zahran Hashem, a local Islamist hate preacher who was already known to Sri Lankan intelligence agencies. \"I don't think they took this threat seriously enough, to put enough man power to track him down,\" Hilmy Ahmed, Vice President of Sri Lanka's Muslim Association, said Wednesday. He said his organization warned security officials three years ago about Hashem. And it gets worse; immediately before the Easter attacks, there were more warnings.  \"We were told that ten minutes before the blast, Indian intelligence had said that this is going to happen,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"The churches could have been evacuated and at least the number of casualties could have been reduced.\" \n\n            A U.S. official  familiar with the intelligence on Sri Lanka has confirmed to CBS News that the government of India did share specific information with Sri Lanka in the days before the attack. The official said the bombings are believed at this time to be ISIS inspired, but officials continue to look for clear links. Evidence was still being gathered and analyzed, with help from FBI agents on the ground. \"The intelligence had been far too complacent,\" Ahmed said. He agreed with Palmer that it seemed like Sri Lanka's intelligence and security services were more than complacent -- even criminally negligent. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, now CBS News security consultant, says the intelligence failure shows the extent to which Sri Lanka's state security forces are \"inept\" given the threat they're facing.      All day on Tuesday, Christians buried the victims of the attacks. They were still struggling to absorb the loss of loved ones, and the scale of the atrocity.  But Sri Lankan Muslims know that all the anguish, and the anger with the government's failings, could easily turn ugly.  \"We're fearing a backlash,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"Last night most of us could not go to sleep, because, after 104 people were buried at the same time, you know, emotions can run high.\" As the scale of intelligence failure becomes obvious, the government is struggling to explain its actions, and inaction, and to reassure a nervous population.  President Maithripala Sirisena has said he's going to fire all the country's defense chiefs, and restructure the security services. But for many in the country, it will be too little, far too late.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg#\" alt=\"promocbsn.jpg \" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg 1x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104107", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

If children forget their glasses or if they get broken, then I see a lot of headaches and not feeling well,” said Yoder, a third-grade teacher at Galena Elementary School on Maryland’s upper Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Galena, founded in 1763, was named after a type of silver once mined in the waterfront town. It sits a few miles away from the Delaware border in Kent County. In 2017, the   stood at 737, with an 11.6-percent poverty rate, and some people like Dr. Robert Abel Jr. have taken notice. Abel, who is an ophthalmologist in Delaware, echoed Yoder’s concerns, saying the U.S. has “an epidemic of myopia.” “More and more kids are getting nearsighted from close work and machines, electronic devices,” he said. While research remains inconclusive about whether or not mobile devices alone contribute to myopia,   suggest their research shows multiple factors, including the use of technology, may be culprits. It is known that so-called “near work” — activities conducted near the eyes like reading, computer games and the use of smart phones — can increase myopia. One   found every hour of near work per week increases the chances of nearsightedness by 2 percent.  estimates half of the world’s population will be nearsighted, or myopic, by 2049, with children being the most at risk. People with myopia have good vision when looking at an object close up, but poor distance vision. While nearsightedness is easily corrected with glasses, it can lead to other long-term issues for the eye, like cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration if left  . Now schools and nonprofits are trying to address what they see as a growing problem, as more children need eyeglasses but can’t afford them. A 2017 Maryland law requires students get eye screenings in first grade, and again by the time students enter ninth grade. Those years form a huge gap when vision problems could arise — much of the school work children do is performed close to the eyes. This year, state legislators   that attempted to close that gap, including by giving students at any grade who have behavioral or learning problems free eye exams, but they remain in committee. In recent years, some states have passed laws to improve vision care for school children. In 2014, an   went into effect requiring all children age 7 or younger to have free vision screenings, eye exams and glasses, if needed, upon attending public schools. The state recognized the strong connection between vision and classroom performance and seeks to identify and assist those who do not have the visual skills necessary for their grade level. In 2017,   in-school vision screenings to help more schools meet the state’s existing requirements. \n In Maryland’s Kent County Public Schools, a mobile vision clinic has helped to ensure more children have access to free eye exams, glasses and, as a result, the chance to learn. The national organization works with local funding partners, states and ophthalmologists to offer free eye care to school children in need. Last November, the nonprofit Vision to Learn made a stop at Galena Elementary. One by one, students boarded a converted 151-square-foot Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, where an optometrist and optician conducted eye exams inside. Children who needed glasses then selected from a choice of 30 frames. A few weeks later, the Vision to Learn van returned to hand out the glasses at a school assembly. The glasses were given out like awards. That way, educators and health providers hoped to combat any stigma of wearing glasses. Vision to Learn has expanded to 14 states, each with their own corresponding mobile clinic van. It’s the brainchild of Austin Beutner, a businessman and philanthropist who recently became the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District. Beutner has said he saw how inner-city students struggled in the classroom and wanted to create a tangible solution — glasses. Other organizations, like OnSight’s “Vision Van” in New York and VSP Global’s “Eyes of Hope” mobile clinic, headquartered in California, have taken up the same cause in an effort to improve student outcomes. A   have found students with poor vision have worse academic performance than their peers. Researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles studied Vision to Learn’s program and found a   on student math and reading scores after they received glasses.   conducted by UCLA doctors found that 20 percent of students have vision problems that can be caught by an eye screening and as much as 90 percent of those issues can be fixed with glasses. Low-income families in this Maryland community often struggle to afford trips to medical appointments, cost of exams and expensive frames and lenses, according to local administrators. All three of Kent County’s elementary schools and its one middle school qualify to receive federal funding because they enroll a high percentage of low-income students. In 2016, 48 percent of Galena Elementary students received free or reduced lunch. Lack of transportation can pose an obstacle for students, preventing them from reaching appointments, said Melissa King, a registered nurse for the Kent County Health Department who works with local school health services. “A lot of our students here aren’t able to get the vision care that they need,” King said. Having doctors come to the students at school eliminates the transportation barrier, she said. More than 150 students received eye exams during the van’s four-day visit to the county, according to the Vision to Learn team. In total, they have given away 107,516 free glasses and made 6,079 visits to schools and community organizations in the participating states. For the students who need them, the gesture can be transformational. “It felt good [getting] some vision [care] I didn’t have in a while,” said 11th grader Tykee Bryant, who had just finished his first eye exam ever and was looking forward to getting his glasses. “Sooner or later, I’ll get glasses, and it’ll help me out.” Sixth grader Kacie Morris remembered how hard it was to read in class. “I can see now so I don’t have to like squint or anything,” said Morris after accepting a free pair of glasses from the clinic. “I can actually finally see.” Vision to Learn plans to continue serving students but is also looking to expand in the near future, Abel said. A practicing ophthalmologist who spearheaded the Delaware chapter of Vision to Learn and now sits on the board, Abel said he is working to double the mobile clinics in his area. He sees the need and possibility to expand outside of the U.S. and hopes to implement similar mobile vision eye care systems for other populations in need, including homeless adults and incarcerated youth. “Vision is critical to education and to everyone,” Abel said.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104108", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.cbsnews.com", "section": "World", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-executes-37-people-for-alleged-terrorism-related-crimes/", "title": "Saudi Arabia executes 37 people for alleged terrorism-related crimes", "author": "", "author_link": null, "published_date": "1", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "\n\n    \n            -- Saudi Arabia on Tuesday beheaded 37 Saudi citizens, most of them minority Shiites, in a mass execution across the country for alleged terrorism-related crimes. It also publicly pinned the executed body and severed head of a convicted Sunni extremist to a pole as a warning to others. \n     The executions were likely to stoke further regional and sectarian tensions between rivals  and Iran. Saudi dissident Ali Al-Ahmed, who runs the Gulf Institute in Washington, identified 34 of those executed as Shiites based on the names announced by the Interior Ministry. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"This is the largest mass execution of Shiites in the kingdom's history,\" he said. Amnesty International also confirmed the majority of those executed were Shiite men. The rights group said they were convicted \"after sham trials\" that relied on confessions extracted through torture. It marked the largest number of executions in a single day in Saudi Arabia since Jan. 2, 2016, when the kingdom executed   in what was the largest mass execution carried out by Saudi authorities since 1980. Among those executed three years ago were four Shiites, including prominent Shiite cleric  , whose death sparked protests from Pakistan to Iran and the ransacking of the  . Saudi-Iran ties have not recovered and the embassy remains shuttered. \n     King Salman ratified by royal decree Tuesday's mass execution and that of 2016.

Al-Ahmed described Tuesday's executions as a politically motivated message to Iran. \"This is political,\" he said. \"They didn't have to execute these people, but it's important for them to ride the American anti-Iranian wave.\" The Interior Ministry's statement said those executed had adopted extremist ideologies and formed terrorist cells with the aim of spreading chaos and provoking sectarian strife. It said the individuals had been found guilty according to the law and ordered executed by the  , which specializes in terrorism trials, and the country's high court. The individuals were found guilty of attacking security installations with explosives, killing a number of security officers and cooperating with enemy organizations against the interests of the country, the Interior Ministry said. The statement was carried across state-run media, including the Saudi news channel al-Ekhbariya. The statement read on the state-run news channel opened with a verse from the Quran that condemns attacks that aim to create strife and disharmony and warns of great punishment for those who carry out such attacks. \n     Al-Ahmed said among those executed was Shiite religious leader Sheikh Mohammed al-Attiyah, whose charges included seeking to form a sectarian group in the western city of Jiddah. Al-Ahmed said the sheikh publicly spoke of the need to work closely with Saudi Arabia's Sunni majority and would lead small prayer groups among Shiites. Amnesty International said 11 of the men were convicted of spying for Iran and sentenced to death after a \"grossly unfair trial.\" At least 14 others executed were convicted of violent offences related to their participation in anti-government demonstrations in Shiite-populated areas of Saudi Arabia between 2011 and 2012. Among those put to death was a young man convicted of a crime that took place when he was 16 years-old, said Amnesty. Saudi Arabia's supreme council of clerics, who are all ultraconservative Sunnis, said the executions were carried out in accordance with Islamic law. The Interior Ministry said the body of one of the executed men - Khaled bin Abdel Karim al-Tuwaijri - was publicly pinned to a pole. The statement did not say in which city of Saudi Arabia the public display took place. He appears to have been convicted as a Sunni militant, though the government did not give a detailed explanation of the charges against each individual executed. It brings the number of people executed since the start of the year to around 100, according to official announcements. Last year, the kingdom executed 149 people, most of them drug smugglers convicted of non-violent crimes, according to Amnesty's most recent figures. \n     Executions are traditionally carried out after midday prayers. Public displays of the bodies of executed men last for around three hours until late afternoon prayers, with the severed head and body hoisted to the top of a pole overlooking a main square.

This \"digital patch\" is the first new effective treatment for lazy eye in half a century, researchers from the Glick Eye Institute at Indiana University said. Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, remains the most common cause of visual impairment in children. Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not develop normally during early childhood. This can occur when one eye is much more nearsighted than the other, or when one eye wanders or strays inward. The child needs to receive treatment by the age of 8 or so while their eyes and brain are still developing, or he or she could become blind in the weaker eye. A recent study found that 1 in 4 kids feel anxiety before using eye drops. Nearly 15 percent refuse to take eye drops at all. Both drops and eye patches work based on the occlusion method. This blocks vision in the eye with the best sight, forcing the brain to rely on the so-called lazy eye. During the process, vision improves though many children will still need glasses to correct their eyesight. In comparison, the electronic glasses used in the study combine vision correction and occlusion. The lenses can be filled to a child's vision prescription. Because the lenses are liquid crystal display (LCD), they can also be programmed to turn opaque, occluding vision in the left or right eye for different time intervals, acting like a digital patch that flickers on and off. Researchers recently tested the effectiveness of occlusion glasses compared to patching in a randomised clinical study. They recruited 33 subjects with lazy eye between age 3 and 8 who wore spectacles to correct their vision. One group wore an adhesive patch for two hours daily. The other wore Amblyz occlusion glasses for 4 hours daily. In the study, the lens over the eye with better vision switched from clear to opaque every 30 seconds. After three months, both groups of children showed the same amount of improvement in the lazy eye, gaining two lines on a reading chart. \"When you talk to adults who underwent childhood treatment for amblyopia, they will tell you that wearing a patch was the worst thing ever,\" said Daniel Neely, a paediatric ophthalmology professor at Indiana University who led the study. \"With these electronic occlusion glasses, the child learns that the lens will be clear again in just a few seconds so they may be more cooperative with the treatment.

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route. A clarification on the non-applicability of the new FDI measure would be critical for them to continue making massive investments in India,\" it added.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104108", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Though well below the price jump seen for the humble 'daily consumable bulb' and tomato, potato also become costlier as crop damages and disruptions stoked supply crunch. Albeit for a brief period during monsoon and afterwards, retail price of tomato went up to Rs 80 per kg. Though trailing behind in the price race, potato joined its buddies of the 'TOP' priority grouping, selling for as high as Rs 30 a kg in retail market for sometime in December due to supply disruptions before moderating to the current level of around Rs 20-25 a kg. Costlier vegetables slowly pushed retail inflation, which had remained well within the Reserve Bank's comfortable level of 4 per cent during most part of 2019, peaked to more than three-year high of 5.54 per cent in November. Tomato, Onion, Potato (TOP) have been accorded 'TOP' priority by central government in 2018-19 Union Budget and a Rs 500 crore Operation Greens was okayed in November last year to boost production and processing of these three commodities to check price volatility in these key kitchen staples. For most part of 2019, the government was successful in price control but the party seemed to have lost the sheen later in the year, thanks to 'TOP' and other food items. Government action to rein-in rising onion prices came in very late, which contracted to import bulk supplies of onion from markets such as Egypt, Turkey and Afghanistan. Even as supplies have been hitting the Indian shores on a daily basis, onion continues to rule at over Rs 130 a kg in various retail domestic markets, potato at Rs 20-30 a kg, while tomato has come down to around Rs 30-40 per kg. Add to this, garlic prices have now started to spike, touching as high as Rs 30-40 for a mere 100 gram. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which mainly gauges the retail inflation to arrive on its bi-monthly monetary policies, has set a medium-term target for Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. In its monetary policy review in December, it raised the retail inflation projection to 5.1-4.7 per cent for the second half of 2019-20 mainly on costlier onion, fruits, pulses, milk and cereals, from 3.5-3.7 per cent projected earlier. For the first half of next fiscal too, it has raised the projection to 4-3.8 per cent. Retail inflation hovered mainly in the range of 2-3.30 per cent during January to August, and started to move up steadily post monsoon as crop damage due to unseasonal rains hurt the supplies in a big way. It unexpectedly hit a pause button on cutting the key (repo) interest rate, giving more importance to prevailing inflation pressure and rising food prices over a worrying slowdown in the economy. The status quo came in after five consecutive cuts in repo rate since February, as the six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, unanimously voted to hold the key repo rate at 5.15 per cent and reverse repo rate at 4.90 per cent. \"Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors. First, the upsurge in prices of vegetables is likely to continue in immediate months; however, a pick-up in arrivals from the late kharif season along with measures taken by the government to augment supply through imports should help soften vegetables prices by early February 2020,\" RBI said on December 5. ICRA Economist Aditi Nayar expects moderation in vegetable prices to a large extent by early 2020. \"Healthy groundwater and reservoir levels bode well for rabi output and yields of various cereals. However, the year-on-year decline in the area sown under rabi pulses and oilseeds poses a concern, given the high inflation being recorded by some of these items,\" Nayar said. ICRA expects the CPI inflation to spike further to 5.8-6 per cent in December 2019. On the wholesale front, the 2019 inflation story was on a different trajectory with prices moving downwards from a high of 3.58 per cent in January to the lowest 0.16 per cent in October mainly on account of cheaper fuel and power. The up-tick of WPI inflation to 0.58 per cent in November was attributable to costlier vegetables, mainly onion as well as pulses. As per the government data, prices of onion in the wholesale market went up by 172 per cent in November from a year ago. On the WPI-CPI divergence, brokerage firm Anand Rathi said at 5.5 per cent in November, retail inflation was at a multi-year high while, in the same month, WPI inflation at 0.6 per cent was modest. \"High food inflation contrasted with deflation in fuel and manufactured product inflation is creating this situation as the retail price index assigns much higher weights to food than does the WPI. Besides, the inclusion of services in retail but not in the wholesale index continued, as, despite being on a falling clip, services inflation was relatively elevated,\" as per Anand Rathi. CARE Ratings expects inflation to range in 4-4.5 per cent for the rest of the year (2019-20), adding the \"base effect will not be favourable in the coming months\". While the surge in vegetable prices will eventually reverse, the elevated inflation for pulses needs to be watched with caution, unless rabi sowing picks up pace, according to Nayar. \"The RBI rate pause is likely to continue. The RBI targets retail inflation, which has jumped 240 basis points (bps) in the last four months and is now close to the upper end of the RBI's target zone. Consequently, despite low core and WPI inflation, as also deflation in fuel and manufactured product prices, the RBI is unlikely to cut the policy rate soon. Low growth, however, rules out any rate hike,\" Anand Rathi brokerage said.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104108", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

If children forget their glasses or if they get broken, then I see a lot of headaches and not feeling well,” said Yoder, a third-grade teacher at Galena Elementary School on Maryland’s upper Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Galena, founded in 1763, was named after a type of silver once mined in the waterfront town. It sits a few miles away from the Delaware border in Kent County. In 2017, the   stood at 737, with an 11.6-percent poverty rate, and some people like Dr. Robert Abel Jr. have taken notice. Abel, who is an ophthalmologist in Delaware, echoed Yoder’s concerns, saying the U.S. has “an epidemic of myopia.” “More and more kids are getting nearsighted from close work and machines, electronic devices,” he said. While research remains inconclusive about whether or not mobile devices alone contribute to myopia,   suggest their research shows multiple factors, including the use of technology, may be culprits. It is known that so-called “near work” — activities conducted near the eyes like reading, computer games and the use of smart phones — can increase myopia. One   found every hour of near work per week increases the chances of nearsightedness by 2 percent.  estimates half of the world’s population will be nearsighted, or myopic, by 2049, with children being the most at risk. People with myopia have good vision when looking at an object close up, but poor distance vision. While nearsightedness is easily corrected with glasses, it can lead to other long-term issues for the eye, like cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration if left  . Now schools and nonprofits are trying to address what they see as a growing problem, as more children need eyeglasses but can’t afford them. A 2017 Maryland law requires students get eye screenings in first grade, and again by the time students enter ninth grade. Those years form a huge gap when vision problems could arise — much of the school work children do is performed close to the eyes. This year, state legislators   that attempted to close that gap, including by giving students at any grade who have behavioral or learning problems free eye exams, but they remain in committee. In recent years, some states have passed laws to improve vision care for school children. In 2014, an   went into effect requiring all children age 7 or younger to have free vision screenings, eye exams and glasses, if needed, upon attending public schools. The state recognized the strong connection between vision and classroom performance and seeks to identify and assist those who do not have the visual skills necessary for their grade level. In 2017,   in-school vision screenings to help more schools meet the state’s existing requirements. \n In Maryland’s Kent County Public Schools, a mobile vision clinic has helped to ensure more children have access to free eye exams, glasses and, as a result, the chance to learn. The national organization works with local funding partners, states and ophthalmologists to offer free eye care to school children in need. Last November, the nonprofit Vision to Learn made a stop at Galena Elementary. One by one, students boarded a converted 151-square-foot Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, where an optometrist and optician conducted eye exams inside. Children who needed glasses then selected from a choice of 30 frames. A few weeks later, the Vision to Learn van returned to hand out the glasses at a school assembly. The glasses were given out like awards. That way, educators and health providers hoped to combat any stigma of wearing glasses. Vision to Learn has expanded to 14 states, each with their own corresponding mobile clinic van. It’s the brainchild of Austin Beutner, a businessman and philanthropist who recently became the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District. Beutner has said he saw how inner-city students struggled in the classroom and wanted to create a tangible solution — glasses. Other organizations, like OnSight’s “Vision Van” in New York and VSP Global’s “Eyes of Hope” mobile clinic, headquartered in California, have taken up the same cause in an effort to improve student outcomes. A   have found students with poor vision have worse academic performance than their peers. Researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles studied Vision to Learn’s program and found a   on student math and reading scores after they received glasses.   conducted by UCLA doctors found that 20 percent of students have vision problems that can be caught by an eye screening and as much as 90 percent of those issues can be fixed with glasses. Low-income families in this Maryland community often struggle to afford trips to medical appointments, cost of exams and expensive frames and lenses, according to local administrators. All three of Kent County’s elementary schools and its one middle school qualify to receive federal funding because they enroll a high percentage of low-income students. In 2016, 48 percent of Galena Elementary students received free or reduced lunch. Lack of transportation can pose an obstacle for students, preventing them from reaching appointments, said Melissa King, a registered nurse for the Kent County Health Department who works with local school health services. “A lot of our students here aren’t able to get the vision care that they need,” King said. Having doctors come to the students at school eliminates the transportation barrier, she said. More than 150 students received eye exams during the van’s four-day visit to the county, according to the Vision to Learn team. In total, they have given away 107,516 free glasses and made 6,079 visits to schools and community organizations in the participating states. For the students who need them, the gesture can be transformational. “It felt good [getting] some vision [care] I didn’t have in a while,” said 11th grader Tykee Bryant, who had just finished his first eye exam ever and was looking forward to getting his glasses. “Sooner or later, I’ll get glasses, and it’ll help me out.” Sixth grader Kacie Morris remembered how hard it was to read in class. “I can see now so I don’t have to like squint or anything,” said Morris after accepting a free pair of glasses from the clinic. “I can actually finally see.” Vision to Learn plans to continue serving students but is also looking to expand in the near future, Abel said. A practicing ophthalmologist who spearheaded the Delaware chapter of Vision to Learn and now sits on the board, Abel said he is working to double the mobile clinics in his area. He sees the need and possibility to expand outside of the U.S. and hopes to implement similar mobile vision eye care systems for other populations in need, including homeless adults and incarcerated youth. “Vision is critical to education and to everyone,” Abel said.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104108", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "telanganatoday.com", "section": "Sport", "sub_section": "", "article_url": "https://telanganatoday.com/hca-does-a-volte-face-names-zakir-as-chief-coach", "title": "HCA does a volte face, names Zakir as chief coach", "author": " ", "author_link": null, "published_date": "27th Dec 2020", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "\n", "text": ": Controversies continue to dog the Hyderabad Cricket Association. After approving Anirudh Singh as chief coach of the Hyderabad senior team four days ago, the HCA did a volte face on Saturday.

Both president Mohd Azharuddin and secretary R Vijayanand were not available for comments on the sudden change. No reasons were given by the association on this sudden development. For Anirudh, who is considered a sincere coach, this is yet another blow. He was removed as Under-19 coach last season for reasons best known to the association. Meanwhile, joint secretary Naresh Sharma has strongly objected to the change of chief coach. “We all had agreed for Anirudh Singh as chief coach but the sudden change has surprised me. It gives a wrong signal,” he said.

In an interview with Spiegel Online, physician Friedemann Müller explained the case was rare, but not unique. He said Munira Abdulla was in a state of minimal consciousness and that her condition improved enormously over the course of a few weeks.  \n  \n  \n\n \n In 1991, Abdulla was with her son, Omar Webair, when a school bus collided with their car, Abu Dhabi newspaper   reported. Her son, cradled by his mother before the crash, escaped with a bruise to the head. Müller, a neurological specialist, told Spiegel Online that Abdulla's vegetative state shouldn't be confused with a coma. \"No patient simply wakes up from a coma after 27 years,\" he was quoted as saying. During her years in hospitals, Abdulla was tube-fed and underwent physiotherapy to prevent her muscles from deteriorating. After she was transferred to Germany, Müller said doctors took a more holistic approach, changing Abdulla's epilepsy drugs and introducing her to different stimuli like the chirping of birds.  Her son was the first to notice an improvement, and she eventually began responding to others in the room, pronouncing her son's name and reciting verses from the Quran.  \n     Webair said one day, he woke up to someone calling his name. \"It was her. She was calling my name. I was flying with joy. For years I have dreamt of this moment, and my name was the first word she said,\" Webair told The National. He said he never gave up on his mother because he \"always had a feeling that one day she will wake up.\" Müller said the case is not unique, citing an American man named   who began speaking again after 20 years in a vegetative state. He said the case does provide hope for patients in similar situations. \"Don't consider them dead when they are in such a state,\" Webair told The National. \"All those years, the doctors told me she was a hopeless case and that there was no point of the treatment I was seeking for her, but whenever in doubt I put myself in her place and did whatever I could to improve her condition.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg#\" alt=\"George Blake Holding Coat \" layout=\"fill\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/640x360/3bd3727aa711fb7521d7170e1ef8e88f/blake.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/12/26/e1ea3348-5f71-42d0-9bba-3c5d679daf2b/thumbnail/1280x720/a959f53d248f6fb7dc4ddfff51e2e2b3/blake.jpg 2x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104108", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Last week, however, the Ninth Circuit granted the government's emergency motion to stay the lower court's ruling, allowing DHS to resume the practice.  The government had been expanding the policy after former DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen first implemented it at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego in late January. The policy is designed to address the unprecedented flow of migrant families from Central America heading towards the U.S.-Mexico border.  \n  \n  \n\n \n Under the policy — which is also in place at the ports of entry in Calexico, California and El Paso, Texas — nearly 2,000 migrants have been returned to Mexico to await their court hearing, a Mexican government official told CBS News.  \n\n    \n           U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in the Northern District of California issued an injunction halting the administration's practice earlier this month. He said the plaintiffs, a group of immigrant rights groups and asylum seekers, \"met their burden\" to block the policy on the grounds that \"it lacks sufficient protections against aliens being returned to places where they face undue risk to their lives or freedom.\" The Trump administration, however, has claimed the policy is designed to help the government stabilize the situation at the southwestern border, where U.S. officials have been struggling to handle a unprecedented surge of migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — collectively known as the \"Northern Triangle.\" Thousands of migrants are traveling across the continent, fleeing the widespread poverty and chronic poverty in their countries and hoping to seek asylum in the U.S.  Last month, U.S. immigration authorities said they reached a \"breaking point\" after apprehending or turning back   — including approximately 53,000 families and nearly 9,000 unaccompanied children — along the U.S.-Mexico border.  \n     The surge has incensed Mr. Trump, who has accused Democrats and judges of hampering his hardline immigration agenda. He has also berated Mexico and countries in Central America for not doing enough to prevent migrants from traveling across their borders, vowing to   to the \"Northern Triangle\" and possibly shuttering the border with Mexico.  \"A very big Caravan of over 20,000 people started up through Mexico,\" the president   Wednesday morning. \"It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming.

More security camera video emerged on Wednesday, showing two of the suspected attackers inside a luxury hotel.  Officials have said there were nine bombers in all, including one woman. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer said a video released by  , shows eight of the purported suicide attackers swearing allegiance to the terror group. But officials are still unclear how much of a role ISIS actually played, beyond inspiring the attack. Sri Lanka's junior defense minister reiterated on Wednesday the government's stance that two relatively unknown local Islamic extremist groups were behind the attack.  Junior minister Ruwan Wijewardene also told reporters that many of the bombers were highly educated and came from well-off families.  \"Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,\" Wijewardene said. \"They are quite well-educated people,\" he said, noting that at least one had a degree in law and that some of them may have lived and studied in the United Kingdom or Australia.    But the man in who stood in the middle of the group shown in the ISIS video -- the only one not hiding his face -- was Moulavi Zahran Hashem, a local Islamist hate preacher who was already known to Sri Lankan intelligence agencies. \"I don't think they took this threat seriously enough, to put enough man power to track him down,\" Hilmy Ahmed, Vice President of Sri Lanka's Muslim Association, said Wednesday. He said his organization warned security officials three years ago about Hashem. And it gets worse; immediately before the Easter attacks, there were more warnings.  \"We were told that ten minutes before the blast, Indian intelligence had said that this is going to happen,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"The churches could have been evacuated and at least the number of casualties could have been reduced.\" \n\n            A U.S. official  familiar with the intelligence on Sri Lanka has confirmed to CBS News that the government of India did share specific information with Sri Lanka in the days before the attack. The official said the bombings are believed at this time to be ISIS inspired, but officials continue to look for clear links. Evidence was still being gathered and analyzed, with help from FBI agents on the ground. \"The intelligence had been far too complacent,\" Ahmed said. He agreed with Palmer that it seemed like Sri Lanka's intelligence and security services were more than complacent -- even criminally negligent. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, now CBS News security consultant, says the intelligence failure shows the extent to which Sri Lanka's state security forces are \"inept\" given the threat they're facing.      All day on Tuesday, Christians buried the victims of the attacks. They were still struggling to absorb the loss of loved ones, and the scale of the atrocity.  But Sri Lankan Muslims know that all the anguish, and the anger with the government's failings, could easily turn ugly.  \"We're fearing a backlash,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"Last night most of us could not go to sleep, because, after 104 people were buried at the same time, you know, emotions can run high.\" As the scale of intelligence failure becomes obvious, the government is struggling to explain its actions, and inaction, and to reassure a nervous population.  President Maithripala Sirisena has said he's going to fire all the country's defense chiefs, and restructure the security services.

Yet if prize organizers hoped to get through this year’s awards without controversy, they will likely be disappointed. The Swedish Academy called Handke “one of the most influential writers in Europe” and praised his work for exploring “the periphery and the specificity of human experience.” But the 76-year-old author has long faced criticism for his vigorous defense of the Serbs during the 1990s wars that devastated the Balkans as Yugoslavia disintegrated. He spoke at the 2006 funeral of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who at the time was facing war crimes charges, calling him “a rather tragic man.” Handke — who once called for the Nobel Prize to be abolished — said he was “astonished” to receive the literature award. “I never thought they would choose me,” Handke told reporters outside his home in suburban Paris. “It was very courageous by the Swedish academy, this kind of decision,” he added. “These are good people.” If Handke’s victory caused uncomfortable ripples, the choice of Tokarczuk was welcomed by liberal-minded authors and readers in her native Poland and beyond. The 57-year-old novelist, known for her humanist themes and playful, subversive streak, has often irked Poland’s populists and conservatives. The academy said she was chosen for works that explore the “crossing of boundaries as a form of life.” Already a major cultural figure in Poland, Tokarczuk has a growing international profile, especially since she won the Booker International prize in 2018 for the novel “Flights.” She told Polish broadcaster TVN on Thursday that she was “terribly happy and proud” that her novels, which describe events in small towns in Poland “can be read as universal and can be important for people around the world.” Handke has been a big name in European literature for decades, crafting works — starting with his first novel, “The Hornets,” in 1966 — that combine introspection and a provocative streak. One early play was called “Offending the Audience” and featured actors insulting theatergoers. He has written screenplays, several of them for German director Wim Wenders, who also filmed Handke’s 1970 novel, “The Goalie’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick.” He was praised by the Swedish Academy for writing powerfully about catastrophe, notably in “A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,” his 1972 autobiographical novel about his mother’s suicide. But his staunch support of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkans wars has set him at odds with many other Western intellectuals. In a 1996 essay, “Justice for Serbia,” Handke accused Western news media of always depicting Serbs as aggressors. He denied that genocide was committed when Bosnian Serb troops massacred some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in the enclave of Srebrenica in 1995, and was an opponent of NATO’s airstrikes against Serbia for that country’s violent crackdown in Kosovo in the late 1990s. In an interview with Serbia’s state TV earlier this year, Handke said those behind the bombing “don’t belong to Europe and the planet Earth.” Handke’s views led novelist Salman Rushdie in 1999 to call him a contender for “International Moron of the Year.” Rushdie’s publicist at Penguin Random House said Thursday that Rushdie stood by what he wrote in 1999. Novelist Jennifer Egan, president of PEN America, said the writers’ group deeply regretted the choice of Handke. “We are dumbfounded by the selection of a writer who has used his public voice to undercut historical truth and offer public succor to perpetrators of genocide,” she said. “At a moment of rising nationalism, autocratic leadership, and widespread disinformation around the world, the literary community deserves better than this.”  In 2006, Handke turned down the Heinrich Heine award from the German city of Duesseldorf after his selection sparked a row among the city’s politicians. His selection as winner of the International Ibsen Award for drama in 2014 also prompted protests from human rights groups. That same year, he told the Austrian Press Agency that the Nobel Prize should be abolished because of its “false canonization” of literature. Serbian officials and media hailed Handke on Thursday as a “great friend of Serbia,” but Kosovans reacted angrily to his Nobel Prize. Vlora Citaku, Kosovo’s ambassador to the United States, tweeted that “In a world full of brilliant writers, the Nobel committee chooses to reward a propagator of ethnic hatred & violence. Something has gone terribly wrong!” Albanian Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj, who was born in Kosovo, tweeted that the award was “an ignoble & shameful act.” In contrast, the win by Tokarczuk — Poland’s fifth Nobel literature laureate — was greeted with praise even by her erstwhile critics. Tokarcuzk has been attacked by Polish conservatives — and received death threats — for criticizing aspects of the country’s past, including its episodes of anti-Semitism. She is also a strong critic of Poland’s current right-wing government. Her 2014 novel “The Books of Jacob” tackles the forced conversion of Polish Jews to Catholicism in the 18th century. Her book “Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead” is a crime thriller with feminist and animal-rights themes that offers a sometimes unflattering depiction of small-town Polish life. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski, who said earlier this week that he has not finished any of Tokarczuk’s books, tweeted his congratulations and said he now felt obliged to go back and read her books all the way through. Polish President Andrzej Duda called it a “great day for Polish literature.” Tokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the Nobel literature prize in more than a century. Of the 11 Nobels awarded so far this week, all the other laureates have been men. Both literature winners will receive a full cash prize, valued this year at 9 million kronor ($918,000), a gold medal and a diploma at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10. The literature prize was canceled last year after an exodus of members from the exclusive Swedish Academy following sex abuse allegations. Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011. The Nobel Foundation had warned that another group would award the literature prize if the academy didn’t improve its tarnished image, but said in March it was satisfied the Swedish Academy had revamped itself and restored trust. The 2018 and 2019 awards were chosen by the Swedish Academy’s Nobel Committee, a new body made up of four academy members and five “external specialists.” Nobel organizers say the committee suggests two names that then must be approved by the Swedish Academy. It’s unclear whether academy members simply rubber-stamped the experts’ choice. The literature awards follow Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine handed out earlier this week. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded on Friday and the economics award on Monday.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104109", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "telugu.samayam.com", "section": "48238931.cms", "sub_section": "Telugu News", "article_url": "https://telugu.samayam.com/photo-gallery/cinema/ariyana-glory-and-mukku-avinash-celebrates-christmas-festival/photoshow/79965830.cms", "title": null, "author": null, "author_link": "", "published_date": null, "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "", "image_url": "<img alt=\"Telugu News\" title=\"Telugu News\" src=\"https://static.langimg.com/thumb/msid-78040135,width-270,resizemode-4/telugu-samayam.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104106", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The research could pave the way for many more efficient and greener chemical processes, including the procedure known as carbon capture -trapping carbon dioxide from major sources, for example a fossil-fuel power plant, and storing it to prevent its entry into the atmosphere. \"Materials which contain permanent holes, or pores, are technologically important. They are used for manufacturing a range of products from plastic bottles to petrol,\" said Stuart James of Queen's School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. \"However, until recently, these porous materials have been solids. What we have done is to design a special liquid from the 'bottom-up' -we designed the shapes of the molecules which make up the liquid so that the liquid could not fill up all the space,\" James said. \"Because of the empty holes we then had in the liquid, we found that it was able to dissolve unusually large amounts of gas,\" he said. \"A few more years' research will be needed, but if we can find applications for these porous liquids they could result in new or improved chemical processes,\" James said.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104109", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

More security camera video emerged on Wednesday, showing two of the suspected attackers inside a luxury hotel.  Officials have said there were nine bombers in all, including one woman. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer said a video released by  , shows eight of the purported suicide attackers swearing allegiance to the terror group. But officials are still unclear how much of a role ISIS actually played, beyond inspiring the attack. Sri Lanka's junior defense minister reiterated on Wednesday the government's stance that two relatively unknown local Islamic extremist groups were behind the attack.  Junior minister Ruwan Wijewardene also told reporters that many of the bombers were highly educated and came from well-off families.  \"Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,\" Wijewardene said. \"They are quite well-educated people,\" he said, noting that at least one had a degree in law and that some of them may have lived and studied in the United Kingdom or Australia.    But the man in who stood in the middle of the group shown in the ISIS video -- the only one not hiding his face -- was Moulavi Zahran Hashem, a local Islamist hate preacher who was already known to Sri Lankan intelligence agencies. \"I don't think they took this threat seriously enough, to put enough man power to track him down,\" Hilmy Ahmed, Vice President of Sri Lanka's Muslim Association, said Wednesday. He said his organization warned security officials three years ago about Hashem. And it gets worse; immediately before the Easter attacks, there were more warnings.  \"We were told that ten minutes before the blast, Indian intelligence had said that this is going to happen,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"The churches could have been evacuated and at least the number of casualties could have been reduced.\" \n\n            A U.S. official  familiar with the intelligence on Sri Lanka has confirmed to CBS News that the government of India did share specific information with Sri Lanka in the days before the attack. The official said the bombings are believed at this time to be ISIS inspired, but officials continue to look for clear links. Evidence was still being gathered and analyzed, with help from FBI agents on the ground. \"The intelligence had been far too complacent,\" Ahmed said. He agreed with Palmer that it seemed like Sri Lanka's intelligence and security services were more than complacent -- even criminally negligent. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, now CBS News security consultant, says the intelligence failure shows the extent to which Sri Lanka's state security forces are \"inept\" given the threat they're facing.      All day on Tuesday, Christians buried the victims of the attacks. They were still struggling to absorb the loss of loved ones, and the scale of the atrocity.  But Sri Lankan Muslims know that all the anguish, and the anger with the government's failings, could easily turn ugly.  \"We're fearing a backlash,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"Last night most of us could not go to sleep, because, after 104 people were buried at the same time, you know, emotions can run high.\" As the scale of intelligence failure becomes obvious, the government is struggling to explain its actions, and inaction, and to reassure a nervous population.  President Maithripala Sirisena has said he's going to fire all the country's defense chiefs, and restructure the security services.

Among those executed three years ago were four Shiites, including prominent Shiite cleric  , whose death sparked protests from Pakistan to Iran and the ransacking of the  . Saudi-Iran ties have not recovered and the embassy remains shuttered. \n     King Salman ratified by royal decree Tuesday's mass execution and that of 2016. The king, who has empowered his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has asserted a bolder and more decisive leadership style than previous monarchs since ascending to the throne in 2015. \n\n           The kingdom and its Sunni-led Arab allies have also been emboldened by U.S. President Donald Trump's unwavering dedication to pressuring Iran's Shiite clerical leadership, which includes his decision to pull out of a   and re-impose punishing sanctions to cripple its economy. Al-Ahmed described Tuesday's executions as a politically motivated message to Iran. \"This is political,\" he said. \"They didn't have to execute these people, but it's important for them to ride the American anti-Iranian wave.\" The Interior Ministry's statement said those executed had adopted extremist ideologies and formed terrorist cells with the aim of spreading chaos and provoking sectarian strife. It said the individuals had been found guilty according to the law and ordered executed by the  , which specializes in terrorism trials, and the country's high court. The individuals were found guilty of attacking security installations with explosives, killing a number of security officers and cooperating with enemy organizations against the interests of the country, the Interior Ministry said. The statement was carried across state-run media, including the Saudi news channel al-Ekhbariya. The statement read on the state-run news channel opened with a verse from the Quran that condemns attacks that aim to create strife and disharmony and warns of great punishment for those who carry out such attacks. \n     Al-Ahmed said among those executed was Shiite religious leader Sheikh Mohammed al-Attiyah, whose charges included seeking to form a sectarian group in the western city of Jiddah. Al-Ahmed said the sheikh publicly spoke of the need to work closely with Saudi Arabia's Sunni majority and would lead small prayer groups among Shiites. Amnesty International said 11 of the men were convicted of spying for Iran and sentenced to death after a \"grossly unfair trial.\" At least 14 others executed were convicted of violent offences related to their participation in anti-government demonstrations in Shiite-populated areas of Saudi Arabia between 2011 and 2012. Among those put to death was a young man convicted of a crime that took place when he was 16 years-old, said Amnesty. Saudi Arabia's supreme council of clerics, who are all ultraconservative Sunnis, said the executions were carried out in accordance with Islamic law. The Interior Ministry said the body of one of the executed men - Khaled bin Abdel Karim al-Tuwaijri - was publicly pinned to a pole. The statement did not say in which city of Saudi Arabia the public display took place. He appears to have been convicted as a Sunni militant, though the government did not give a detailed explanation of the charges against each individual executed. It brings the number of people executed since the start of the year to around 100, according to official announcements. Last year, the kingdom executed 149 people, most of them drug smugglers convicted of non-violent crimes, according to Amnesty's most recent figures. \n     Executions are traditionally carried out after midday prayers. Public displays of the bodies of executed men last for around three hours until late afternoon prayers, with the severed head and body hoisted to the top of a pole overlooking a main square. This latest mass execution comes days after four ISIS gunmen were killed by Saudi security forces while trying to attack a security building north of the capital, Riyadh.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/27/7bacdcd2-94f6-40b8-bc46-953d27fab718/thumbnail/620x432g6/8de8bb14579ef2b046f9f1c2e1cf3986/salman.jpg#\" alt=\"Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman talks with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud during the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) Summit in Riyadh \" height=\"432\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/27/7bacdcd2-94f6-40b8-bc46-953d27fab718/thumbnail/620x432g6/8de8bb14579ef2b046f9f1c2e1cf3986/salman.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/12/27/7bacdcd2-94f6-40b8-bc46-953d27fab718/thumbnail/1240x864g6/1e429055494e0629a1674f6d493d3c79/salman.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20432'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104109", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added.

The players were criticised for not “taking a knee” ahead of a recent series against England as had been done by other sporting teams following the death of George Floyd in the United States earlier in the year. The statement said the decision to show a raised fist was reached “through a process of deep democracy” to be appropriate in a South African context. “The raised fist is a powerful gesture in our own history, as expressed in the iconic images of Nelson and Winnie Mandela on Mandela’s release from prison in 1990. In this context it was a powerful gesture of triumph, an acknowledgment of the struggle against apartheid, and a commitment to continuing to fight for equality, justice and freedom, while also honouring the religious and cultural responsibilities of every member of our team.” The statement noted that the raised fist had a long history within the Civil Rights movement, which included the gesture by American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games. “We recognise the historical and political connotations of the raised fist as a gesture of ongoing solidarity in the fight for racial justice and anti-racism work.

However, the experienced coach Manolo Marquez Roca feels the result will not affect their morale going into their next match against Kerala Blasters. Speaking on the eve of their ISL clash against strugglers Kerala, who are placed at ninth without a win yet, the Spaniard felt Mumbai City FC were a strong team and they were good on the day. “In football, there are three possibilities: win, draw or loss. It is impossible to maintain only one. After losing one game, no team becomes bad. I think the loss against Mumbai does not affect our team for tomorrow’s game. We will go out to play a good game and win tomorrow,” he said. On being asked about the loss against strong opponents Mumbai and not converting the chances, he said, “I don’t think we created too many chances. I only remember one clear chance from (Mohammad) Yasir one minute before the half time. With the equaliser, the second half would have been different. But with a young and inexperienced side, I am happy with the way they played in the second half.” Speaking about their opponents Kerala Blasters, he rated the team very high on talent. “For me it is a very good team. They played an open game in the championship against ATK and they didn’t deserve to lose. In the last game, they equalised in injury time. They have got good players and they deserve more points than what they have now. For sure it will be a tough battle,” he added. When asked about major changes in the upcoming game, he said he does not believe in changing the team because of one loss. “There are a few areas from the Mumbai game where we can improve and change some players maybe. We are not going to make too many tactical changes and we played six games and had only one loss. Can’t change too many things.” He said talented Indian player Nikhil Poojary will be out of this game owing to injuries. “You don’t win games on revealing who is playing or not. For me, the squad is of 29 players and 28 players were training and only one player was out with injury. All other players are in the contention for a place. Only Nikhil is not in the reckoning because of injury,” he concluded. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday. Click the link to subscribe.

More security camera video emerged on Wednesday, showing two of the suspected attackers inside a luxury hotel.  Officials have said there were nine bombers in all, including one woman. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer said a video released by  , shows eight of the purported suicide attackers swearing allegiance to the terror group. But officials are still unclear how much of a role ISIS actually played, beyond inspiring the attack. Sri Lanka's junior defense minister reiterated on Wednesday the government's stance that two relatively unknown local Islamic extremist groups were behind the attack.  Junior minister Ruwan Wijewardene also told reporters that many of the bombers were highly educated and came from well-off families.  \"Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,\" Wijewardene said. \"They are quite well-educated people,\" he said, noting that at least one had a degree in law and that some of them may have lived and studied in the United Kingdom or Australia.    But the man in who stood in the middle of the group shown in the ISIS video -- the only one not hiding his face -- was Moulavi Zahran Hashem, a local Islamist hate preacher who was already known to Sri Lankan intelligence agencies. \"I don't think they took this threat seriously enough, to put enough man power to track him down,\" Hilmy Ahmed, Vice President of Sri Lanka's Muslim Association, said Wednesday. He said his organization warned security officials three years ago about Hashem. And it gets worse; immediately before the Easter attacks, there were more warnings.  \"We were told that ten minutes before the blast, Indian intelligence had said that this is going to happen,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"The churches could have been evacuated and at least the number of casualties could have been reduced.\" \n\n            A U.S. official  familiar with the intelligence on Sri Lanka has confirmed to CBS News that the government of India did share specific information with Sri Lanka in the days before the attack. The official said the bombings are believed at this time to be ISIS inspired, but officials continue to look for clear links. Evidence was still being gathered and analyzed, with help from FBI agents on the ground. \"The intelligence had been far too complacent,\" Ahmed said. He agreed with Palmer that it seemed like Sri Lanka's intelligence and security services were more than complacent -- even criminally negligent. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, now CBS News security consultant, says the intelligence failure shows the extent to which Sri Lanka's state security forces are \"inept\" given the threat they're facing.      All day on Tuesday, Christians buried the victims of the attacks. They were still struggling to absorb the loss of loved ones, and the scale of the atrocity.  But Sri Lankan Muslims know that all the anguish, and the anger with the government's failings, could easily turn ugly.  \"We're fearing a backlash,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"Last night most of us could not go to sleep, because, after 104 people were buried at the same time, you know, emotions can run high.\" As the scale of intelligence failure becomes obvious, the government is struggling to explain its actions, and inaction, and to reassure a nervous population.  President Maithripala Sirisena has said he's going to fire all the country's defense chiefs, and restructure the security services.

This \"digital patch\" is the first new effective treatment for lazy eye in half a century, researchers from the Glick Eye Institute at Indiana University said. Lazy eye, also called amblyopia, remains the most common cause of visual impairment in children. Amblyopia is poor vision in an eye that did not develop normally during early childhood. This can occur when one eye is much more nearsighted than the other, or when one eye wanders or strays inward. The child needs to receive treatment by the age of 8 or so while their eyes and brain are still developing, or he or she could become blind in the weaker eye. A recent study found that 1 in 4 kids feel anxiety before using eye drops. Nearly 15 percent refuse to take eye drops at all. Both drops and eye patches work based on the occlusion method. This blocks vision in the eye with the best sight, forcing the brain to rely on the so-called lazy eye. During the process, vision improves though many children will still need glasses to correct their eyesight. In comparison, the electronic glasses used in the study combine vision correction and occlusion. The lenses can be filled to a child's vision prescription. Because the lenses are liquid crystal display (LCD), they can also be programmed to turn opaque, occluding vision in the left or right eye for different time intervals, acting like a digital patch that flickers on and off. Researchers recently tested the effectiveness of occlusion glasses compared to patching in a randomised clinical study. They recruited 33 subjects with lazy eye between age 3 and 8 who wore spectacles to correct their vision. One group wore an adhesive patch for two hours daily. The other wore Amblyz occlusion glasses for 4 hours daily. In the study, the lens over the eye with better vision switched from clear to opaque every 30 seconds. After three months, both groups of children showed the same amount of improvement in the lazy eye, gaining two lines on a reading chart. \"When you talk to adults who underwent childhood treatment for amblyopia, they will tell you that wearing a patch was the worst thing ever,\" said Daniel Neely, a paediatric ophthalmology professor at Indiana University who led the study. \"With these electronic occlusion glasses, the child learns that the lens will be clear again in just a few seconds so they may be more cooperative with the treatment. For parents who have struggled with drops and patching, this could be a great alternative,\" said Neely.", "image_url": "<img src=\"http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"70\" alt=\"Catch News\" title=\"Catch News\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104109", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The 2022 World Cup qualifier between the Iranian national team and Cambodia at Tehran’s Azadi Stadium marks a decades-long push by Iranian women to be able to watch soccer matches, something hard-liners in Iran’s Shiite theocracy to this day still oppose. Iran allocated only 4,000 tickets for women in a stadium that seats about 80,000 people, keeping them separated from men and under the protection of female police officers. That’s even though face-painted Iranian women have cheered for their team abroad for years, despite the 1981 ban that followed the country’s Islamic Revolution. “We are so happy that finally we got the chance to go to the stadium. It’s an extraordinary feeling,” said Zahra Pashaei, a 29-year-old nurse who has only known soccer games from television. “At least for me, 22 or 23 years of longing and regret lies behind this.” The majority of Azadi, or “Freedom,” Stadium was empty except for the raucous crowd of women who could be heard chanting and cheering amid the match. Iran in the second half was up 10-0 over Cambodia. Iranian state television, which long has been controlled by hard-liners in the Islamic Republic, aired footage of women cheering and commentators even acknowledged their presence. While Iran for years has considered letting women into soccer matches, the decision to allow them in Thursday came as part of intense pressure from FIFA, the world body governing the sport. Iran faced a potential ban if it didn’t allow women into the match. That pressure has grown both with FIFA and Iran’s soccer-loving public since September, when an Iranian woman detained for dressing as a man to sneak into a soccer stadium to watch a match died after setting herself on fire upon learning she learned she could spend six months in prison. The self-immolation death of 29-year-old Sahar Khodayari, who became known as the “Blue Girl” for her love of the Iranian team Esteghlal, shocked Iranian officials and the public, becoming an immediate hashtag trend across social media in the Islamic Republic. Iran is the world’s last nation to bar women from soccer matches. Saudi Arabia recently began allowing women into soccer matches in the kingdom. Hard-liners and traditional Shiite clerics, citing their own interpretation of Islamic law, believe in segregating men and women at public events, as well as keeping women out of men’s sports. They’ve maintained tight control on social mores in the times since the Islamic Revolution, which saw women required to cover their hair and also wear the black, all-encompassing chador while working in government jobs. The effort to allow women back into stadiums has gone through fits and starts since the revolution. Iran even barred a woman from holding a sign for the country when it attends its first Summer Olympics in 1986 in South Korea. A group of Irish women received special permission to attend a qualifier between Iran and Ireland in Tehran in 2001. In 2006, former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he wanted women to attend matches to “improve soccer-watching manners and promote a healthy atmosphere.” However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, opposed the decision. Then, last year, Iranian authorities allowed a select group of women into Azadi Stadium by invitation only to watch the Asian Champion League final. Activist groups outside of Iran, however, remain suspicious of Tehran. Amnesty International called the decision “a cynical publicity stunt by the authorities intended to whitewash their image.” “Instead of taking half-hearted steps to address their discriminatory treatment of women who want to watch football, the Iranian authorities should lift all restrictions on women attending football matches, including domestic league games, across the country,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa research and advocacy director. Still, many in Iran embraced the move, like shopkeeper Amir Ali Bagheri, who sold the nurse Pashaei a new Team Melli jersey ahead of the match. “They (women) are so excited they are going to the stadium,” he said. “God willing, there will be freedom sooner so that they can attend all matches, not just the national team matches. That will be much better.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104110", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

If children forget their glasses or if they get broken, then I see a lot of headaches and not feeling well,” said Yoder, a third-grade teacher at Galena Elementary School on Maryland’s upper Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Galena, founded in 1763, was named after a type of silver once mined in the waterfront town. It sits a few miles away from the Delaware border in Kent County. In 2017, the   stood at 737, with an 11.6-percent poverty rate, and some people like Dr. Robert Abel Jr. have taken notice. Abel, who is an ophthalmologist in Delaware, echoed Yoder’s concerns, saying the U.S. has “an epidemic of myopia.” “More and more kids are getting nearsighted from close work and machines, electronic devices,” he said. While research remains inconclusive about whether or not mobile devices alone contribute to myopia,   suggest their research shows multiple factors, including the use of technology, may be culprits. It is known that so-called “near work” — activities conducted near the eyes like reading, computer games and the use of smart phones — can increase myopia. One   found every hour of near work per week increases the chances of nearsightedness by 2 percent.  estimates half of the world’s population will be nearsighted, or myopic, by 2049, with children being the most at risk. People with myopia have good vision when looking at an object close up, but poor distance vision. While nearsightedness is easily corrected with glasses, it can lead to other long-term issues for the eye, like cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration if left  . Now schools and nonprofits are trying to address what they see as a growing problem, as more children need eyeglasses but can’t afford them. A 2017 Maryland law requires students get eye screenings in first grade, and again by the time students enter ninth grade. Those years form a huge gap when vision problems could arise — much of the school work children do is performed close to the eyes. This year, state legislators   that attempted to close that gap, including by giving students at any grade who have behavioral or learning problems free eye exams, but they remain in committee. In recent years, some states have passed laws to improve vision care for school children. In 2014, an   went into effect requiring all children age 7 or younger to have free vision screenings, eye exams and glasses, if needed, upon attending public schools. The state recognized the strong connection between vision and classroom performance and seeks to identify and assist those who do not have the visual skills necessary for their grade level. In 2017,   in-school vision screenings to help more schools meet the state’s existing requirements. \n In Maryland’s Kent County Public Schools, a mobile vision clinic has helped to ensure more children have access to free eye exams, glasses and, as a result, the chance to learn. The national organization works with local funding partners, states and ophthalmologists to offer free eye care to school children in need. Last November, the nonprofit Vision to Learn made a stop at Galena Elementary. One by one, students boarded a converted 151-square-foot Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, where an optometrist and optician conducted eye exams inside. Children who needed glasses then selected from a choice of 30 frames. A few weeks later, the Vision to Learn van returned to hand out the glasses at a school assembly. The glasses were given out like awards. That way, educators and health providers hoped to combat any stigma of wearing glasses. Vision to Learn has expanded to 14 states, each with their own corresponding mobile clinic van. It’s the brainchild of Austin Beutner, a businessman and philanthropist who recently became the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District. Beutner has said he saw how inner-city students struggled in the classroom and wanted to create a tangible solution — glasses. Other organizations, like OnSight’s “Vision Van” in New York and VSP Global’s “Eyes of Hope” mobile clinic, headquartered in California, have taken up the same cause in an effort to improve student outcomes. A   have found students with poor vision have worse academic performance than their peers. Researchers from the University of California at Los Angeles studied Vision to Learn’s program and found a   on student math and reading scores after they received glasses.   conducted by UCLA doctors found that 20 percent of students have vision problems that can be caught by an eye screening and as much as 90 percent of those issues can be fixed with glasses. Low-income families in this Maryland community often struggle to afford trips to medical appointments, cost of exams and expensive frames and lenses, according to local administrators. All three of Kent County’s elementary schools and its one middle school qualify to receive federal funding because they enroll a high percentage of low-income students. In 2016, 48 percent of Galena Elementary students received free or reduced lunch. Lack of transportation can pose an obstacle for students, preventing them from reaching appointments, said Melissa King, a registered nurse for the Kent County Health Department who works with local school health services. “A lot of our students here aren’t able to get the vision care that they need,” King said. Having doctors come to the students at school eliminates the transportation barrier, she said. More than 150 students received eye exams during the van’s four-day visit to the county, according to the Vision to Learn team. In total, they have given away 107,516 free glasses and made 6,079 visits to schools and community organizations in the participating states. For the students who need them, the gesture can be transformational. “It felt good [getting] some vision [care] I didn’t have in a while,” said 11th grader Tykee Bryant, who had just finished his first eye exam ever and was looking forward to getting his glasses. “Sooner or later, I’ll get glasses, and it’ll help me out.” Sixth grader Kacie Morris remembered how hard it was to read in class. “I can see now so I don’t have to like squint or anything,” said Morris after accepting a free pair of glasses from the clinic. “I can actually finally see.” Vision to Learn plans to continue serving students but is also looking to expand in the near future, Abel said. A practicing ophthalmologist who spearheaded the Delaware chapter of Vision to Learn and now sits on the board, Abel said he is working to double the mobile clinics in his area. He sees the need and possibility to expand outside of the U.S. and hopes to implement similar mobile vision eye care systems for other populations in need, including homeless adults and incarcerated youth. “Vision is critical to education and to everyone,” Abel said.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104111", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},{"website": "www.catchnews.com", "section": "NEWS", "sub_section": ["/science-news/page-17/"], "article_url": "http://www.catchnews.com/science-news/why-most-earth-like-planet-is-uninhabitable-1447821592.html", "title": "Why the most Earth-like planet is uninhabitable ", "author": null, "author_link": "http://www.catchnews.com/author/news-agencies-1472728714.html", "published_date": "\n", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "In the search for Earth-like worlds beyond the solar system, Kepler-438b seemed to have it all, but a team of scientists has suggested that vast amounts of radiation may be making life impossible there. As per the University of Warwick research, the atmosphere of the planet, Kepler-438b, is thought to have been stripped away as a result of radiation emitted from a superflaring Red Dwarf star, Kepler-438. Regularly occurring every few hundred days, the superflares are approximately ten times more powerful than those ever recorded on the Sun and equivalent to the same energy as 100 billion megatons of TNT. While superflares themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on Kepler-438b's atmosphere, a dangerous phenomenon associated with powerful flares, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has the potential to strip away any atmosphere and render it uninhabitable. The planet Kepler-438b, to date the exoplanet with the highest recorded Earth Similarity Index, is both similar in size and temperature to the Earth but is in closer proximity to the Red Dwarf than the Earth is to the Sun. Lead researcher David Armstrong explained that if the planet, Kepler-438b, has a magnetic field like the Earth, it may be shielded from some of the effects, but if it does not, or the flares are strong enough, it could have lost its atmosphere, be irradiated by extra dangerous radiation and be a much harsher place for life to exist.

Elephants tend to have smaller sperm than mice because the larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length, a new study suggests. In the animal world, if several males mate with the same female, their sperm compete to fertilise her limited supply of eggs. Longer sperm often seem to have a competitive advantage.  However, the study conducted by researchers from the Universities of Zurich and Stockholm now shows that the size of the animals also matters. The larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length. That is why elephants have smaller sperm than mice, researchers said. Stefan Lupold from the University of Zurich and his colleague John Fitzpatrick from University of Stockholm compared the influence of sperm competition on the evolution of sperm in 100 mammalian species.  Unlike previous studies, however, they did not just consider sperm length, but also the number of sperm per ejaculate, which is important as the resources available for sperm production need to be shared between sperm size and number. In other words, the longer every individual sperm, the fewer of them a testicle of a certain size can produce. Earlier studies suggested that the number of sperm might be just as important as sperm length, if not even more so.  After all, the more sperm a male fields against his competitors, the greater the likelihood that one of them will win. Based on their joint consideration of sperm size and number, and with the aid of new meta-analytical methods, the researchers now show that species facing intense sperm competition invest more in their ejaculates on average than their monogamous counterparts. Moreover, they discovered that whether the length or the number of sperm is more important actually depends on the size of the animals.  The bigger the animal, the greater the selection pressure on the overall investments in ejaculates and the more important the number of sperm becomes compared to sperm length. This is due to the more voluminous female reproductive tract, in which the sperm tend to get lost or become \"diluted.\"  In larger species, sperm length or speed probably comes into effect only if a sufficient number of sperm manage to get near the egg, researchers said. In smaller species, however, the distance for sperm to cover is shorter and the risk of loss much smaller, allowing the advantage of longer sperm to manifest itself. As a result, you tend to find the most complex sperm forms in small species, not in large ones. For instance, small fruit flies have the longest sperm ever described, not whales, whose sperm are less than a tenth of a millimetre long and almost a thousand times shorter than those of the flies.

More security camera video emerged on Wednesday, showing two of the suspected attackers inside a luxury hotel.  Officials have said there were nine bombers in all, including one woman. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer said a video released by  , shows eight of the purported suicide attackers swearing allegiance to the terror group. But officials are still unclear how much of a role ISIS actually played, beyond inspiring the attack. Sri Lanka's junior defense minister reiterated on Wednesday the government's stance that two relatively unknown local Islamic extremist groups were behind the attack.  Junior minister Ruwan Wijewardene also told reporters that many of the bombers were highly educated and came from well-off families.  \"Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,\" Wijewardene said. \"They are quite well-educated people,\" he said, noting that at least one had a degree in law and that some of them may have lived and studied in the United Kingdom or Australia.    But the man in who stood in the middle of the group shown in the ISIS video -- the only one not hiding his face -- was Moulavi Zahran Hashem, a local Islamist hate preacher who was already known to Sri Lankan intelligence agencies. \"I don't think they took this threat seriously enough, to put enough man power to track him down,\" Hilmy Ahmed, Vice President of Sri Lanka's Muslim Association, said Wednesday. He said his organization warned security officials three years ago about Hashem. And it gets worse; immediately before the Easter attacks, there were more warnings.  \"We were told that ten minutes before the blast, Indian intelligence had said that this is going to happen,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"The churches could have been evacuated and at least the number of casualties could have been reduced.\" \n\n            A U.S. official  familiar with the intelligence on Sri Lanka has confirmed to CBS News that the government of India did share specific information with Sri Lanka in the days before the attack. The official said the bombings are believed at this time to be ISIS inspired, but officials continue to look for clear links. Evidence was still being gathered and analyzed, with help from FBI agents on the ground. \"The intelligence had been far too complacent,\" Ahmed said. He agreed with Palmer that it seemed like Sri Lanka's intelligence and security services were more than complacent -- even criminally negligent. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, now CBS News security consultant, says the intelligence failure shows the extent to which Sri Lanka's state security forces are \"inept\" given the threat they're facing.      All day on Tuesday, Christians buried the victims of the attacks. They were still struggling to absorb the loss of loved ones, and the scale of the atrocity.  But Sri Lankan Muslims know that all the anguish, and the anger with the government's failings, could easily turn ugly.  \"We're fearing a backlash,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"Last night most of us could not go to sleep, because, after 104 people were buried at the same time, you know, emotions can run high.\" As the scale of intelligence failure becomes obvious, the government is struggling to explain its actions, and inaction, and to reassure a nervous population.  President Maithripala Sirisena has said he's going to fire all the country's defense chiefs, and restructure the security services. But for many in the country, it will be too little, far too late.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg#\" alt=\"promocbsn.jpg \" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg 1x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104110", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Coming into Tests, everyone expected him to be on the top of the game. However, the world no.1 ranked Test batsman Smith failed to open the account as Ashwin sent him to pavilion early in the innings. But Mike Hussey backed the cricketer saying he is a human too. “There’s definitely been a shift from this Indian team. In the past, because Steve Smith walks across the crease so much, teams have bowled wide to him, and with that, they set a more off-side field and hope he’s going to hit the ball through there. But I think this Indian team has gone the other way.” “They know his strength is off the pads, so they’ve put fielders there to block up the runs but then bowled straight at the stumps, so he just has to miss one or edge one – he is human and can get something wrong – and unfortunately it has worked,” he added.

But Meghan, again, she's an independent woman of her own thinking,\" Brown said.      Though popular, Markle has faced heavy scrutiny in the quick transition to royalty. The 37-year-old television star and philanthropist has been the target of online trolling, racism and rumors of growing tensions within the royal family. The royal family has since announced new \"social media community guidelines\" to \"create a safe environment\" on the royal family's social media platforms.  \"I think she's done a great job of coming into this immensely difficult situation,\" Brown said. \"And when you consider that when [Princess] Diana came in, she was 20. Meghan is 36. She's an accomplished celebrity already.\"  Not only is Markle dealing with the media, but she also has to deal with \"the awful gossiping, feuding, snaky, vipering, hissing courtiers of the different rival camps\" in the palace, Brown said.  Princess Diana also got flak for breaking from tradition, Brown said, whether it was deciding to not home-school her children or taking her baby on royal tours.  \"So [Markle is] just moving the needle,\" Brown said.

More security camera video emerged on Wednesday, showing two of the suspected attackers inside a luxury hotel.  Officials have said there were nine bombers in all, including one woman. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer said a video released by  , shows eight of the purported suicide attackers swearing allegiance to the terror group. But officials are still unclear how much of a role ISIS actually played, beyond inspiring the attack. Sri Lanka's junior defense minister reiterated on Wednesday the government's stance that two relatively unknown local Islamic extremist groups were behind the attack.  Junior minister Ruwan Wijewardene also told reporters that many of the bombers were highly educated and came from well-off families.  \"Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,\" Wijewardene said. \"They are quite well-educated people,\" he said, noting that at least one had a degree in law and that some of them may have lived and studied in the United Kingdom or Australia.    But the man in who stood in the middle of the group shown in the ISIS video -- the only one not hiding his face -- was Moulavi Zahran Hashem, a local Islamist hate preacher who was already known to Sri Lankan intelligence agencies. \"I don't think they took this threat seriously enough, to put enough man power to track him down,\" Hilmy Ahmed, Vice President of Sri Lanka's Muslim Association, said Wednesday. He said his organization warned security officials three years ago about Hashem. And it gets worse; immediately before the Easter attacks, there were more warnings.  \"We were told that ten minutes before the blast, Indian intelligence had said that this is going to happen,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"The churches could have been evacuated and at least the number of casualties could have been reduced.\" \n\n            A U.S. official  familiar with the intelligence on Sri Lanka has confirmed to CBS News that the government of India did share specific information with Sri Lanka in the days before the attack. The official said the bombings are believed at this time to be ISIS inspired, but officials continue to look for clear links. Evidence was still being gathered and analyzed, with help from FBI agents on the ground. \"The intelligence had been far too complacent,\" Ahmed said. He agreed with Palmer that it seemed like Sri Lanka's intelligence and security services were more than complacent -- even criminally negligent. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, now CBS News security consultant, says the intelligence failure shows the extent to which Sri Lanka's state security forces are \"inept\" given the threat they're facing.      All day on Tuesday, Christians buried the victims of the attacks. They were still struggling to absorb the loss of loved ones, and the scale of the atrocity.  But Sri Lankan Muslims know that all the anguish, and the anger with the government's failings, could easily turn ugly.  \"We're fearing a backlash,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"Last night most of us could not go to sleep, because, after 104 people were buried at the same time, you know, emotions can run high.\" As the scale of intelligence failure becomes obvious, the government is struggling to explain its actions, and inaction, and to reassure a nervous population.  President Maithripala Sirisena has said he's going to fire all the country's defense chiefs, and restructure the security services.

It also publicly pinned the executed body and severed head of a convicted Sunni extremist to a pole as a warning to others. \n     The executions were likely to stoke further regional and sectarian tensions between rivals  and Iran. Saudi dissident Ali Al-Ahmed, who runs the Gulf Institute in Washington, identified 34 of those executed as Shiites based on the names announced by the Interior Ministry. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"This is the largest mass execution of Shiites in the kingdom's history,\" he said. Amnesty International also confirmed the majority of those executed were Shiite men. The rights group said they were convicted \"after sham trials\" that relied on confessions extracted through torture. It marked the largest number of executions in a single day in Saudi Arabia since Jan. 2, 2016, when the kingdom executed   in what was the largest mass execution carried out by Saudi authorities since 1980. Among those executed three years ago were four Shiites, including prominent Shiite cleric  , whose death sparked protests from Pakistan to Iran and the ransacking of the  . Saudi-Iran ties have not recovered and the embassy remains shuttered. \n     King Salman ratified by royal decree Tuesday's mass execution and that of 2016. The king, who has empowered his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has asserted a bolder and more decisive leadership style than previous monarchs since ascending to the throne in 2015. \n\n           The kingdom and its Sunni-led Arab allies have also been emboldened by U.S. President Donald Trump's unwavering dedication to pressuring Iran's Shiite clerical leadership, which includes his decision to pull out of a   and re-impose punishing sanctions to cripple its economy. Al-Ahmed described Tuesday's executions as a politically motivated message to Iran. \"This is political,\" he said. \"They didn't have to execute these people, but it's important for them to ride the American anti-Iranian wave.\" The Interior Ministry's statement said those executed had adopted extremist ideologies and formed terrorist cells with the aim of spreading chaos and provoking sectarian strife. It said the individuals had been found guilty according to the law and ordered executed by the  , which specializes in terrorism trials, and the country's high court. The individuals were found guilty of attacking security installations with explosives, killing a number of security officers and cooperating with enemy organizations against the interests of the country, the Interior Ministry said. The statement was carried across state-run media, including the Saudi news channel al-Ekhbariya. The statement read on the state-run news channel opened with a verse from the Quran that condemns attacks that aim to create strife and disharmony and warns of great punishment for those who carry out such attacks. \n     Al-Ahmed said among those executed was Shiite religious leader Sheikh Mohammed al-Attiyah, whose charges included seeking to form a sectarian group in the western city of Jiddah. Al-Ahmed said the sheikh publicly spoke of the need to work closely with Saudi Arabia's Sunni majority and would lead small prayer groups among Shiites. Amnesty International said 11 of the men were convicted of spying for Iran and sentenced to death after a \"grossly unfair trial.\" At least 14 others executed were convicted of violent offences related to their participation in anti-government demonstrations in Shiite-populated areas of Saudi Arabia between 2011 and 2012. Among those put to death was a young man convicted of a crime that took place when he was 16 years-old, said Amnesty. Saudi Arabia's supreme council of clerics, who are all ultraconservative Sunnis, said the executions were carried out in accordance with Islamic law. The Interior Ministry said the body of one of the executed men - Khaled bin Abdel Karim al-Tuwaijri - was publicly pinned to a pole. The statement did not say in which city of Saudi Arabia the public display took place. He appears to have been convicted as a Sunni militant, though the government did not give a detailed explanation of the charges against each individual executed. It brings the number of people executed since the start of the year to around 100, according to official announcements. Last year, the kingdom executed 149 people, most of them drug smugglers convicted of non-violent crimes, according to Amnesty's most recent figures. \n     Executions are traditionally carried out after midday prayers. Public displays of the bodies of executed men last for around three hours until late afternoon prayers, with the severed head and body hoisted to the top of a pole overlooking a main square.

The next wave of growth could come from increasing exports to large and traditionally under penetrated markets such as Japan, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Latin America, which would help the industry meet its aspiration of becoming the world's largest supplier by volume, according to pharma industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). Experts said improved access to medicines in India and exploring new markets while maintaining thrust in the US will help the country's pharma industry to record double-digit growth in the coming year. However, the sector, specially pharmaceuticals, will be up against headwinds of increased costs related to regulatory compliances, particularly for the US market, price controls across markets and mandatory genericisation in India. \"The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is a sunrise industry with a competitive advantage for India. We should leverage India's position by unleashing entrepreneurial spirit through policy stability and ecosystem,\" IPA Secretary General Sudarshan Jain said. The bullish outlook for the sector is also reflected in the forecast by rating agency Icra, which has projected the Indian pharmaceutical industry to grow around 10-12 per cent between FY2019 and FY2022 while maintaining a stable outlook on the sector. It cited abating headwinds from pricing pressure in the US (which is the largest regulated market), stable growth for the Indian market driven by increasing healthcare spending and better accessibility as likely key growth drivers for the Indian pharma companies, coupled with comfortable balance sheet structure. As for the healthcare sector, Apollo Hospitals Group MD Suneeta Reddy said, \"The prognosis is positive.\" The optimism is driven by the Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an increasing number of middle-class seeking quality and affordable healthcare, along with the ability of private payers to attract global patients. Reddy said the private Indian healthcare providers are also ready to play their part in accelerating the country's economic growth. \"... the sector is capable of delivering strong impetus for India's economy at a time when the country needs to hear good news on the economic front,\" she noted. Reddy cited the ability of private healthcare providers to create five direct jobs plus many more indirect jobs per bed, two and half times multiplier on capital invested along with global prestige and stature driven by the Medical Value Travel programmes as key strengths of the sector. Having gone through 2019, during which domestic drug firms came under the scanner of the US health regulator -- US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) -- which red-flagged homegrown majors like Aurobindo Pharma, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Cadila Healthcare, among others for lapses at their facilities, the challenges remain real. Yes Securities Senior Analyst - Institutional Equities - Bhavesh Gandhi said, \"pharma sector continued to show divergent trends in 2019 with the domestic market growing at a steady 9-10 per cent run rate offset by persistent challenges in US generics\". Most of the domestic-focused companies saw healthy traction in revenues on the back of market tailwinds, he said. The US business has proved to be a tough task for yet another year as structural headwinds still persisted despite the flattening out of price erosion at 5-6 per cent as compared to steeper falls in earlier years, he added. Max Healthcare & Radiant Life Care Chairman & MD Abhay Soi said in 2020, the global and domestic demand for quality and cost-effective healthcare services is expected to grow further. The Indian healthcare sector has the potential to be amongst the highest revenue and employment generator for the country. \"A shift towards patient-centric quality care, enhanced use of technology in delivering care, and higher share of India in medical tourism are some of the dominant trends which the Indian healthcare sector is going to witness in 2020,\" he noted. As for the service providers, he said,\"I believe, in 2020 and onwards, the main differentiator would be patient care and service. Healthcare institutions would be focusing on all the key touchpoints of the entire patient journey\". Highlighting the priorities, Healthcare Federation of India (NATHEALTH) President Sudarshan Ballal said that in 2020, 'Health for Healthcare' would be the main mantra for all stakeholders including policymakers and regulators. \"Balancing sustainability, improving quality, and value creation would be the top priorities for the sector. There is a need for quality healthcare to be delivered to everyone in India, hence incentivising capacity building in Tier II & III cities would go a long way in achieving the goal of universal healthcare,\" he added. Healthcare in India is on the cusp of significant transformation -- demographic, regulatory, technological and financial -- Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) President A Vaidheesh said. Indian government's thrust on universal healthcare through Ayushman Bharat and an estimated 140 million households expected to enter the middle class in the next decade, not only increases the consumption of healthcare services but also has an impact on healthcare demand and a significant uptake inpatient volumes, he added. While it seems all hunky-dory, medical devices manufacturers want issues affecting them to be addressed satisfactorily. Medical devices makers' body, AdvaMed Vice President Abby Pratt said it would urge the government to promote the adoption of global harmonisation, including internationally recognised standards, that would not only help ensure the quality and efficacy of products but also enable an ecosystem for manufacturing, research, and innovation for benefits of patients in India.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104112", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The \"playful and engaging\" bricks will be inclusive to allow sighted teachers, students and family members to use the bricks together. \n     The Lego Foundation is piloting the program, which features the new product called Lego Braille Bricks. Each brick represents a different Braille letter or number and is designed to be used by all children, not just those who are visually impaired. The bricks will also feature printed characters to allow sighted people to read them. According to a press release, the new bricks will be \"fully compatible\" with existing Lego bricks. The set will include about 250 bricks featuring the complete Braille alphabet, as well as some numbers and math symbols. It will also come with \"inspiration for teaching and interactive games.\" \n Braille bricks are currently being tested in Danish, Norwegian, English and Portuguese — the company is testing German, Spanish and French later this year. Lego expects them to become widely available in 2020, and they will be given for free to select institutions around the world. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"With thousands of audiobooks and computer programs now available, fewer kids are learning to read Braille,\" said Philippe Chazal, Treasurer of the European Blind Union. \"This is particularly critical when we know that Braille users often are more independent, have a higher level of education and better employment opportunities. We strongly believe LEGO Braille Bricks can help boost the level of interest in learning Braille, so we're thrilled that the LEGO Foundation is making it possible to further this concept and bring it to children around the world.\" \n\n    \n           The concept was first proposed in 2011 by the Danish Association of the Blind, and again in 2017 by the Brazil-based Dorina Nowill Foundation for the Blind. Since then, associations from Denmark, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Norway have collaborated to bring the project to life. \"Blind and visually impaired children have dreams and aspirations for their future just as sighted children\" said John Goodwin, CEO of the LEGO Foundation. \"They have the same desire and need to explore the world and socialise through play, but often face involuntary isolation as a consequence of exclusion from activities...I hope children, parents, caregivers, teachers and practitioners worldwide will be as excited as we are, and we can't wait to see the positive impact.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/24/8762c8fa-3ff4-4942-b5b6-98861425ea60/thumbnail/620x413/5596562ecbd252a10a98c1c76bb2cb2d/highres-braille-bricks-box.jpg#\" alt=\"highres-braille-bricks-box.jpg \" height=\"413\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/24/8762c8fa-3ff4-4942-b5b6-98861425ea60/thumbnail/620x413/5596562ecbd252a10a98c1c76bb2cb2d/highres-braille-bricks-box.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/24/8762c8fa-3ff4-4942-b5b6-98861425ea60/thumbnail/1240x826/32c42ec88c567ae32c7466c02be99580/highres-braille-bricks-box.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20413'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104112", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Orion's thermal protection system is one of the most critical parts of the spacecraft intended to facilitate human exploration of asteroids and of Mars. It consists of the spacecraft's main heat shield that faces into the atmosphere on reentry to slow the spaceship down and also the grid of tiles known as the back shell. During Orion's next mission atop the agency's Space Launch System rocket, called Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1), the spacecraft will be in space for more than three weeks and return to Earth under even faster and hotter conditions than during its last flight. \"As we move towards building the system for EM-1, we've been able to take advantage of what we learned from building and flying Orion to refine our processes going forward,\" said John Kowal, NASA's thermal protection system lead for Orion. During EM-1, Orion will endure a more intense re-entry environment. While the spacecraft encountered speeds of 30,000 feet per second during Exploration Flight Test-1 and temperatures of approximately 2,204 degrees Celsius, it will experience a faster return from lunar velocity of about 36,000 feet per second. The speed difference may seem subtle, but the heating the vehicle sees increases exponentially as the speed increases. Engineering teams are preparing Orion's heat shield to perform re-entry during any of missions planned near the Moon or in high lunar orbit in the coming years. For these future Orion missions, a silver, metallic-based thermal control coating will be bonded to the crew module's thermal protection system back shell tiles. The coating, similar to what is used on the main heat shield, will reduce heat loss during phases when Orion is pointed to space and therefore experiencing cold temperatures, as well as limit the high temperatures the crew module will be subjected to when the spacecraft faces the Sun. The coating will help Orion's back shell maintain a temperature range from approximately minus 101 to 287 degrees Celsius prior to entry and also will protect against electrical surface charges in space and during re-entry. Engineers have also refined the design in ways that improve the manufacturing process and reduce the mass of the spacecraft for the upcoming exploration missions. Instead of a monolithic outer layer, the heat shield will be made of about 180 blocks that can be made simultaneously with the other heat shield components to streamline the labour-and-time-intensive manufacturing process. In addition, engineers have found ways to reduce the mass of the heat shield's underlying structure, which is composed of a titanium skeleton and carbon fiber skin. Teams have optimised the thickness of the skeleton and the skin based on the pressures that different areas will experience during flight and reentry, adding more fidelity to the overall structure while allowing it to be lighter.

It also publicly pinned the executed body and severed head of a convicted Sunni extremist to a pole as a warning to others. \n     The executions were likely to stoke further regional and sectarian tensions between rivals  and Iran. Saudi dissident Ali Al-Ahmed, who runs the Gulf Institute in Washington, identified 34 of those executed as Shiites based on the names announced by the Interior Ministry. \n  \n  \n\n \n \"This is the largest mass execution of Shiites in the kingdom's history,\" he said. Amnesty International also confirmed the majority of those executed were Shiite men. The rights group said they were convicted \"after sham trials\" that relied on confessions extracted through torture. It marked the largest number of executions in a single day in Saudi Arabia since Jan. 2, 2016, when the kingdom executed   in what was the largest mass execution carried out by Saudi authorities since 1980. Among those executed three years ago were four Shiites, including prominent Shiite cleric  , whose death sparked protests from Pakistan to Iran and the ransacking of the  . Saudi-Iran ties have not recovered and the embassy remains shuttered. \n     King Salman ratified by royal decree Tuesday's mass execution and that of 2016. The king, who has empowered his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has asserted a bolder and more decisive leadership style than previous monarchs since ascending to the throne in 2015. \n\n           The kingdom and its Sunni-led Arab allies have also been emboldened by U.S. President Donald Trump's unwavering dedication to pressuring Iran's Shiite clerical leadership, which includes his decision to pull out of a   and re-impose punishing sanctions to cripple its economy. Al-Ahmed described Tuesday's executions as a politically motivated message to Iran. \"This is political,\" he said. \"They didn't have to execute these people, but it's important for them to ride the American anti-Iranian wave.\" The Interior Ministry's statement said those executed had adopted extremist ideologies and formed terrorist cells with the aim of spreading chaos and provoking sectarian strife. It said the individuals had been found guilty according to the law and ordered executed by the  , which specializes in terrorism trials, and the country's high court. The individuals were found guilty of attacking security installations with explosives, killing a number of security officers and cooperating with enemy organizations against the interests of the country, the Interior Ministry said. The statement was carried across state-run media, including the Saudi news channel al-Ekhbariya. The statement read on the state-run news channel opened with a verse from the Quran that condemns attacks that aim to create strife and disharmony and warns of great punishment for those who carry out such attacks. \n     Al-Ahmed said among those executed was Shiite religious leader Sheikh Mohammed al-Attiyah, whose charges included seeking to form a sectarian group in the western city of Jiddah. Al-Ahmed said the sheikh publicly spoke of the need to work closely with Saudi Arabia's Sunni majority and would lead small prayer groups among Shiites. Amnesty International said 11 of the men were convicted of spying for Iran and sentenced to death after a \"grossly unfair trial.\" At least 14 others executed were convicted of violent offences related to their participation in anti-government demonstrations in Shiite-populated areas of Saudi Arabia between 2011 and 2012. Among those put to death was a young man convicted of a crime that took place when he was 16 years-old, said Amnesty. Saudi Arabia's supreme council of clerics, who are all ultraconservative Sunnis, said the executions were carried out in accordance with Islamic law. The Interior Ministry said the body of one of the executed men - Khaled bin Abdel Karim al-Tuwaijri - was publicly pinned to a pole. The statement did not say in which city of Saudi Arabia the public display took place. He appears to have been convicted as a Sunni militant, though the government did not give a detailed explanation of the charges against each individual executed. It brings the number of people executed since the start of the year to around 100, according to official announcements. Last year, the kingdom executed 149 people, most of them drug smugglers convicted of non-violent crimes, according to Amnesty's most recent figures. \n     Executions are traditionally carried out after midday prayers. Public displays of the bodies of executed men last for around three hours until late afternoon prayers, with the severed head and body hoisted to the top of a pole overlooking a main square.

The team issued a statement that said the players had on multiple occasions declared their support for the campaign against racial injustice and “wanted to own our journey”. The players were criticised for not “taking a knee” ahead of a recent series against England as had been done by other sporting teams following the death of George Floyd in the United States earlier in the year. The statement said the decision to show a raised fist was reached “through a process of deep democracy” to be appropriate in a South African context. “The raised fist is a powerful gesture in our own history, as expressed in the iconic images of Nelson and Winnie Mandela on Mandela’s release from prison in 1990. In this context it was a powerful gesture of triumph, an acknowledgment of the struggle against apartheid, and a commitment to continuing to fight for equality, justice and freedom, while also honouring the religious and cultural responsibilities of every member of our team.” The statement noted that the raised fist had a long history within the Civil Rights movement, which included the gesture by American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos during a medal ceremony at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games. “We recognise the historical and political connotations of the raised fist as a gesture of ongoing solidarity in the fight for racial justice and anti-racism work. So, we stand together and raise our fists as a gesture of solidarity and commitment to continuing the work of pursuing racial justice in our lifetimes.”", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/South-African-cricketers.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104112", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

James had a game-high 10 assists and seven rebounds in 31 minutes, while Davis contributed eight rebounds, five assists and two steals and reserve Montrezl Harrell had 22 points for the Lakers, who played on the holiday for a 22nd consecutive year. James, who turns 36 on Wednesday, rose to second on the NBA’s all-time Christmas points list with 383, passing Oscar Robertson by six to pull within 12 of matching the late Kobe Bryant’s career record. It was the 10th Christmas victory in 15 holiday appearances by James, who equaled former Miami teammate Dwyane Wade for the most career Christmas NBA wins. Vogel wants to ease the workload on James after the shortest off-season break in NBA history but James is confident he can handle whatever comes. \nSlovakian star guard Luka Doncic scored 27 points for Dallas, but the Mavericks were outscored in every quarter and outrebounded 53-27. Brooklyn’s Kyrie Irving and Miami’s Duncan Robinson each matched an NBA Christmas record with seven 3-pointers, the Heat stretching their holiday win streak to eight games. Irving scored 37 points, hitting 7-of-10 3-point attempts in his return to Boston, as the Nets ripped his former Celtics teammates 123-95. Robinson finished with 23 points, hitting 7-of-13 from beyond the arc, in leading 2020 NBA runner-up Miami over visiting New Orleans 111-98. Also rolling to a holiday triumph were the Milwaukee Bucks, who had a game-high 31 points from Khris Middleton to beat Golden State 138-99 — the second-most lopsided blowout in NBA Christmas history — thanks to a 72-43 Bucks edge in the second half. At Boston, Brooklyn’s Kevin Durant scored 16 of his 29 in the third quarter and the Nets seized an 86-77 edge before pulling away in the fourth quarter. \nGoran Dragic came off Miami’s bench to score 18 points, and Bam Adebayo added 17 for the Heat, whose NBA-best Christmas record is 11-2 despite Jimmy Butler missing the second half with right ankle stiffness. At Milwaukee, two-time reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 15 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to spark the Bucks, while two-time MVP Stephen Curry had a team-best 19 points. The Los Angeles Clippers beat host Denver 121-108 despite an injury to Kawhi Leonard midway into the fourth quarter when teammate Serge Ibaka struck him in the face going for a rebound, leaving him bleeding and sprawled on the court.

If the humiliation of getting bundled out for 36 wasn’t enough, India was handed a confidence-denting blow when pacer Mohammad Shami was ruled out of the remaining series with a fractured arm. Not to forget the departure of regular skipper and batting mainstay Virat Kohli as he was granted paternity leave by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). After India dominated the first two days of the opening Test, it took a once in a lifetime spell of pace bowling from the duo of Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins to turn the table in Australia’s favour and that first session on the third afternoon combined with Joe Burns’ unbeaten fifty has given the hosts a huge confidence booster. The Indians on the other hand saw their chances of registering a win in the first game vanish in minutes. Now India and Australia are dealing with contrasting feelings as they head into the Boxing Day Test. India, who are without the services of their highest run-scorer (Kohli), now faces a problem with an unstable batting order as none managed to stand up in the second innings and deliver against the Australian attack. Prithvi Shaw looked out of place as he was dismissed in similar fashion — gap between bat and pad — in both the innings and while Shubman Gill is likely to be included in the playing XI for the second Test, it remains to be seen if he will replace Shaw or come in for Kohli. The right-handed batsman had hit the nets on Wednesday while Shaw worked with the support staff. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant too could find a place in the playing XI after first-choice wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha failed to deliver in the first Test. But it would be a little unfair to change the keeper for his failure with the bat. This is a call that stand-in skipper Ajinkya Rahane will have to make. Ravichandran Ashwin, who stole the show in the first Test, has cemented his place and India may go ahead with a twin spin combination if all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is fit to play. Another question that has troubled the visitors is who will replace injured Shami. T Natarajan has impressed everyone with his bowling skills in the limited-over format but Mohammad Siraj and Navdeep Saini are likely to move in as they are part of the Test squad. On the other hand, Australia will be riding on the back of a come-from-behind win in the first Test. While the win helped them maintain their 100 per cent win record in pink-ball Tests, Australia has emerged victorious seven times in their last ten outings in a Boxing Day Test and they would surely want to make that 8 in 11. Overall, the team from Down Under has won 25 matches from 39 games and pose a major threat to opponents when it comes to playing in Melbourne. Steve Smith, who had always dreamt of batting in the Boxing Day Test, has a great record in Australian cricket’s biggest annual event. The right-handed batsman has smashed over 900 runs with three half-centuries. Smith relished batting in a Boxing Day Test and walking out to bat gives him “shivers down the spine”. “Yeah, ten years it is quite hard to believe. Look it’s been since then, I have grown as a player over that time. My Boxing Day record is probably the best in Australia among all grounds. I like batting at MCG,” Smith said in a virtual press conference on Tuesday. It will be interesting to see if he can continue striking gold in the Boxing Day Test or if the Indian bowlers manage to break the spree. Australia coach Justin Langer has said that he is looking at fielding the same XI for the second Test and that clearly means the Indian batsmen have their task cut out when it comes to handling the hosts’ in-form pacers. The only silver lining in an otherwise dark cloud for India is the psychological advantage visitors enjoy over Australia. India had defeated Australia in the 2018 Boxing Day Test by 137 runs. : Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (captain), Hanuma Vihari, Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha (wicket-keeper), Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, R.

The Indian team on Friday announced their playing XI for the Boxing Day Test, making a host of changes to the line-up which featured in Adelaide. Right-handed batsman Gill, who had made 127 runs in the two warm-up games, will open the innings alongside Mayank Agarwal. Gill, who has played three ODIs, replaces Prithvi Shaw in the playing XI. Shaw had come under severe criticism following his failure in the pink-ball Test which India lost by eight wickets. Wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, who returned with scores of 9 and 4 in the first Test, has been replaced by Rishabh Pant. All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja comes into the side after clearing a fitness test on Thursday. Jadeja had injured his hamstring during the first T20I against Australia, minutes before he’d received a blow to the helmet from a Mitchell Starc delivery which led to a concussion. The team management had at that point recommended a three-week recovery period for the all-rounder. Right-arm fast bowler Siraj, who has played one ODI and three T20Is, comes into the side in place of Mohammad Shami who has been ruled out of the series because of an injury. Shami, 30, suffered a fracture on his bowling hand after he was hit by a ball from Australia pace bowler Pat Cummins during India’s second innings in the Adelaide Test. Ajinkya Rahane will lead the Indian side in absence of Virat Kohli who has returned home for the birth of his first child. Cheteshwar Pujara will serve as his deputy. : Ajinkya Rahane (captain), Mayank Agarwal, Shubman Gill, Cheteshwar Pujara (vice-captain), Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Siraj Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

Zelenskiy is trying to save his reputation and distance himself from the U.S. political drama. In an all-day “media marathon” held in a food court, he played down suggestions that Trump pressured him to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden in exchange for military aid to help Ukraine battle Russian-backed separatists. Responding to questions from The Associated Press, Zelenskiy said he only learned after their   that the U.S. had blocked hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. “We didn’t speak about this” during the July call, Zelenskiy said. “There was no blackmail.” Trump asked Zelenskiy during the call to “look into” Biden and his son, according to a rough White House transcript. Congressional Democrats believe Trump was holding up the military aid to use as leverage to pressure Ukraine and advance his domestic political interests before next year’s U.S. presidential election. The July call is central to   and embarrassed Zelenskiy because it showed him as eager to please Trump and critical of European partners whose support he needs to strengthen Ukraine’s economy and to end the conflict with Russia. He said he “didn’t even check” whether the Ukrainian transcript of the July call is the same as that of the White House, but says “I think they match.” Trump later said the military aid was frozen because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine, but the move prompted congressional outcry and the money was released in September. But Zelenskiy said the call “wasn’t linked to weapons or the story with (Ukrainian gas company) Burisma,” where Biden’s son Hunter served on the board. Asked what Ukraine did to persuade the U.S. to release the aid, Zelenskiy said: “We have many diplomatic contacts. And in case we need to find a solution to questions of this level, questions about our country’s security, we use all our powerful possibilities.” He didn’t elaborate. “I don’t want to interfere in any way in the elections” in the U.S., he said. Zelenskiy appears to be playing to both U.S. political camps to ensure Ukraine has continued support no matter who wins the presidential election next year. Zelenskiy said he thought the call would lead to an in-person meeting with Trump, and wanted the American leader to come to Ukraine. Zelenskiy said the “key question” for him was to try to persuade the White House to “change its rhetoric” about Ukraine as a corrupt and untrustworthy country. He said he wanted to meet with Trump in person but that there were “no conditions” set for such a meeting. He said he had “several calls” with Trump, but bristled at repeated questions about their relationship. “We are an independent country, we have relations with many countries,” not just the U.S., he said. A TV and film comedian, Zelenskiy overwhelmingly won the presidency in April on promises to fight corruption and end the five-year conflict with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. He’s treading carefully to ensure continued support from the U.S. while trying to make peace with powerful neighbor Russia. Most of the questions at Thursday’s unusual media event related to the Russia conflict or Ukraine’s economic troubles. In the July call, Trump sought help on two fronts. The first involves Trump’s claims that Ukraine allied with the Democrats in a plot to derail his 2016 presidential campaign. No evidence of such a plot has emerged. At the same time, Trump is also pushing Ukraine to investigate any potential wrongdoing by the Bidens. Trump has said the United States has an “absolute right” to ask foreign leaders to investigate corruption cases, though no one has produced evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the former U.S. vice president or his son. Zelenskiy also joked about Trump’s Twitter missives, saying he doesn’t expect a change in U.S.-Ukrainian relations in the future, “but if there is, we’ll learn about it on Twitter.”", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104113", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Regularly occurring every few hundred days, the superflares are approximately ten times more powerful than those ever recorded on the Sun and equivalent to the same energy as 100 billion megatons of TNT. While superflares themselves are unlikely to have a significant impact on Kepler-438b's atmosphere, a dangerous phenomenon associated with powerful flares, known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), has the potential to strip away any atmosphere and render it uninhabitable.

Lead researcher David Armstrong explained that if the planet, Kepler-438b, has a magnetic field like the Earth, it may be shielded from some of the effects, but if it does not, or the flares are strong enough, it could have lost its atmosphere, be irradiated by extra dangerous radiation and be a much harsher place for life to exist.

In an interview with PBS NewsHour anchor and managing editor Judy Woodruff, Pompeo indicated that the United States does not plan to defend its key partners in the fight against ISIS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces, despite warnings from a bipartisan group of lawmakers that Trump’s decision leaves  them vulnerable to possible slaughter. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been threatening to attack the Kurds in northeast Syria for years, both to clear the area of people he perceives as enemies and to make way for Syrian refugees who have been living in Turkey, whom he wants to resettle in the Kurdish-held northeast.  In 2015, U.S. forces partnered with the SDF in the fight against ISIS in northeast Syria.  The SDF, which functions under the Syrian Kurdish military, is an offshoot of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party, or PKK.  Turkey and the United States both designate the group–known as the PKK — as terrorists.  \n Pompeo appeared to echo Turkey’s perspective, which makes no distinction between Syrian Kurdish soldiers and the PKK, when he answered a question about whether Trump’s decision meant the United States no longer viewed the YPG as allies.  “The Turks had a legitimate security concern,” Pompeo said, justifying the Turkish incursion into northern Syria days after U.S. troops left. “They have a terrorist threat to their south. We’ve been working to make sure that we did what we could do to prevent that terror threat from striking the people in Turkey, while trying to achieve what is in America’s best interest: the threat from radical Islamic terrorism emanating from Syria.” Pompeo said in Wednesday’s interview that the United States was leaving the area because it achieved its singular goal of eliminating ISIS’ territorial hold in Syria, which the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces played an instrumental part in reaching. Following the U.S.’ departure, the SDF has been defending northeastern Syria and guarding ISIS detainees in prisons and camps, but their commanders have said they will likely have to abandon their defensive posts in order to focus on the new threat from Turkey. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers have pushed back against the country’s departure, saying it was unwise and unjust for America to leave Kurdish allies to defend themselves. As Turkey launched Wednesday’s attacks,the Turkish incursion got underway, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., tweeted that the news from Syria was “sickening.” “Impossible to understand why @realDonaldTrump is leaving America’s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS,” she added. Pompeo acknowledged that there is still an ISIS presence in Syria but characterized it as “remnants.” “We have taken down the Caliphate,” he said, using the term to describe ISIS’ territorial presence. “There are ISIS remnants that remain. We’ll continue to be in a position to do what we need to do to keep the American people as safe as we possibly can from this threat.” The SDF said it is guarding around 12,000 ISIS members in the northeast. Last month, an audio recording surfaced from a man believed to be fugitive Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in which he urged followers to liberate detained fighters. “The prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate,” a voice identified as al-Baghdadi, said. “Your brothers and sisters, do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them.” The   also warned recently that ISIS had established “resurgent cells” in Syria. When asked whether, by leaving northeastern Syria, the United States was giving the greenlight to Turkey to attack the Kurds, Pompeo responded, “well, that’s just false. The United States didn’t give Turkey a green light.” He did not elaborate. Pompeo was also asked about his opinion of the July call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which Pompeo had listened in on and which is now a focus of the House of Representatives’ impeachment inquiry against the U.S. president. The president’s critics say the call was a clear request for a foreign government to interfere in U.S. elections. When asked if Trump’s requests of Zelensky had been appropriate, Pompeo responded, “it was consistent with what President Trump has been trying to do to take corruption out. I found that to be wholly appropriate to try to get another country to stop being corrupt.” He also compared it to other diplomatic efforts that countries undertake each day. “Everyone keeps suggesting that somehow there was undue pressure. I assure you, countries all around the world every day call me to try and get America to behave in a way that’s in the best interest of their country. They try to apply pressure to me, and we work on it,” he said.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104114", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

He said Munira Abdulla was in a state of minimal consciousness and that her condition improved enormously over the course of a few weeks.  \n  \n  \n\n \n In 1991, Abdulla was with her son, Omar Webair, when a school bus collided with their car, Abu Dhabi newspaper   reported. Her son, cradled by his mother before the crash, escaped with a bruise to the head. Müller, a neurological specialist, told Spiegel Online that Abdulla's vegetative state shouldn't be confused with a coma. \"No patient simply wakes up from a coma after 27 years,\" he was quoted as saying. During her years in hospitals, Abdulla was tube-fed and underwent physiotherapy to prevent her muscles from deteriorating. After she was transferred to Germany, Müller said doctors took a more holistic approach, changing Abdulla's epilepsy drugs and introducing her to different stimuli like the chirping of birds.  Her son was the first to notice an improvement, and she eventually began responding to others in the room, pronouncing her son's name and reciting verses from the Quran.  \n     Webair said one day, he woke up to someone calling his name. \"It was her.

More security camera video emerged on Wednesday, showing two of the suspected attackers inside a luxury hotel.  Officials have said there were nine bombers in all, including one woman. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer said a video released by  , shows eight of the purported suicide attackers swearing allegiance to the terror group. But officials are still unclear how much of a role ISIS actually played, beyond inspiring the attack. Sri Lanka's junior defense minister reiterated on Wednesday the government's stance that two relatively unknown local Islamic extremist groups were behind the attack.  Junior minister Ruwan Wijewardene also told reporters that many of the bombers were highly educated and came from well-off families.  \"Their thinking is that Islam can be the only religion in this country,\" Wijewardene said. \"They are quite well-educated people,\" he said, noting that at least one had a degree in law and that some of them may have lived and studied in the United Kingdom or Australia.    But the man in who stood in the middle of the group shown in the ISIS video -- the only one not hiding his face -- was Moulavi Zahran Hashem, a local Islamist hate preacher who was already known to Sri Lankan intelligence agencies. \"I don't think they took this threat seriously enough, to put enough man power to track him down,\" Hilmy Ahmed, Vice President of Sri Lanka's Muslim Association, said Wednesday. He said his organization warned security officials three years ago about Hashem. And it gets worse; immediately before the Easter attacks, there were more warnings.  \"We were told that ten minutes before the blast, Indian intelligence had said that this is going to happen,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"The churches could have been evacuated and at least the number of casualties could have been reduced.\" \n\n            A U.S. official  familiar with the intelligence on Sri Lanka has confirmed to CBS News that the government of India did share specific information with Sri Lanka in the days before the attack. The official said the bombings are believed at this time to be ISIS inspired, but officials continue to look for clear links. Evidence was still being gathered and analyzed, with help from FBI agents on the ground. \"The intelligence had been far too complacent,\" Ahmed said. He agreed with Palmer that it seemed like Sri Lanka's intelligence and security services were more than complacent -- even criminally negligent. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, now CBS News security consultant, says the intelligence failure shows the extent to which Sri Lanka's state security forces are \"inept\" given the threat they're facing.      All day on Tuesday, Christians buried the victims of the attacks. They were still struggling to absorb the loss of loved ones, and the scale of the atrocity.  But Sri Lankan Muslims know that all the anguish, and the anger with the government's failings, could easily turn ugly.  \"We're fearing a backlash,\" Ahmed told CBS News. \"Last night most of us could not go to sleep, because, after 104 people were buried at the same time, you know, emotions can run high.\" As the scale of intelligence failure becomes obvious, the government is struggling to explain its actions, and inaction, and to reassure a nervous population.  President Maithripala Sirisena has said he's going to fire all the country's defense chiefs, and restructure the security services. But for many in the country, it will be too little, far too late.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg#\" alt=\"promocbsn.jpg \" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg 1x\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104114", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

The Ahmedabad-bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had earlier this year granted permission to the composite scheme of arrangement, through which two companies were proposed to be demerged -- Jio Digital Fibre Pvt Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd. This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department. However, the NCLAT dismissed it by saying that the NCLT has already dealt with the issue. \"Mere fact that a Scheme may result in reduction of tax liability does not furnish a basis for challenging the validity of the same. \"?We are not inclined to interfere with the Scheme of Arrangement as approved by the Tribunal. Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL). The optical fibre cable infrastructure unit, Jio Digital Fibre Private Ltd (JDFPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 500 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) on March 31, 2019, according to a regulatory filing. Also, mobile tower unit Reliance Jio Infratel Private Ltd(RJIPL) has allocated shares worth Rs 200 crore to RJIL, it added. Both trusts have been set up by RIIHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL as sponsor, and have been granted certificate of registration as Infrastructure Investment Trust by market watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).", "image_url": "<img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/epaper-icon_1.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104114", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo earlier this month shared with their colleagues the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting, one of journalism's highest honors. The reporters were arrested in December 2017 and sentenced last September after being accused of illegally possessing official documents, a violation of a colonial-era law. \n     The court did not given a reason for its decision.  , who are being held in a prison in Yangon, were not present for the ruling, but their wives were. Kyaw Soe Oo's wife, Chit Su, broke down in tears when the ruling was read. \"Both he and I hoped for the best,\" Chit Su told reporters. \"I am terribly sad for this decision.\" \n  \n  \n\n \n Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, had denied the charges against them and contended they were framed by police. International rights groups, media freedom organizations, U.N experts and several governments condemned their conviction as an injustice and an attack on freedom of the press. \"Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo did not commit any crime, nor was there any proof that they did,\" Gail Gove, Reuters chief counsel, said in a statement after the ruling.  \"Instead, they were victims of a police setup to silence their truthful reporting. We will continue to do all we can to free them as soon as possible.\" \n\n    \n           The two men were among the   by Time magazine in its 2018 \"Person of the Year\" edition. Khin Maung Zaw, a lawyer for the two, said the pair could still seek their freedom by petitioning the president's office or the legislature. \n     President Win Myint could reduce the sentence, order a retrial or have them released. Legislative action for a retrial would be a lengthier, more complicated process. \"I am greatly disappointed by the decision of the court because it damaged very much our country's prestige and our right of information and press freedom, it damaged very much,\" Khin Maung Zaw said.  But, I'm not losing hope completely, because all the whole world is on our side. So, as I always said, the case was lost, but the cause was won throughout the whole world.\" Myanmar's military launched a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in the western state of Rakhine in 2017, driving more than 700,000 members of the Muslim Rohingya minority to flee to Bangladesh. \n\n           Reporting on the crackdown has proven sensitive in Buddhist-dominated Myanmar, where many support the campaign and bristle at worldwide condemnation of the military's alleged human rights abuses. The military has denied it any rights abuses and says the campaign is a response to a series of attacks on security personnel by Rohingya insurgents. The Reuters reporters had worked on an investigation of the killing of 10 Rohingya villagers in Inn Din village, for which the government last year said seven soldiers were sentenced to up 10 years in prison with hard labor. Investigators working for the U.N.'s top human rights body said last year that genocide charges should be brought against senior Myanmar military officers, while other critics accused the army of ethnic cleansing. \n     Prosecution witnesses at the reporters' trial gave confusing and conflicting testimony, lending weight to the belief that the arrests were a clumsy setup by the government. The reporters' claim that they were framed was supported by surprise testimony from a whistleblower in the police department, Police Capt. Moe Yan Naing. Although summoned as a prosecution witness, he told the court that his superior had arranged for two policemen to meet the reporters at a restaurant and hand over documents described as \"important secret papers\" in order to entrap them. As a result of his testimony, he was jailed for a year for violating the Police Disciplinary Act and his family was forced to leave their police housing unit. \n\n           A report released in February by Human Rights Watch noted that expectations of a new era of freedom of expression under the government of democracy icon   remain unfulfilled nearly three years after her party ended more than five decades of harsh military rule. The military, however, remains powerful and controls key ministries that are not under civilian oversight, such as defense and internal security. The report said Suu Kyi's government has failed to roll back many of the legal restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly, and has instead toughened some of those laws and enacted a new measure limiting free speech. \n     Journalists have been some of the most high-profile targets. The report cited a Myanmar freedom of expression organization, Athan, as saying that at least 43 journalists have been arrested from when Suu Kyi's government took power in 2016 through last September. In a new case, the online magazine The Irrawaddy reported Monday that it has been sued by the army for its coverage of recent fighting between the government and the Arakan Army ethnic rebel group. It said the suit was filed under Article 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law, which provides for up to three years in prison for \"extorting, coercing, restraining wrongfully, defaming, disturbing, causing undue influence or threatening any person using a telecommunications network.\" There has been an upsurge of fighting since late last year involving attacks by the Arakan Army, which is aligned with Rakhine state's Buddhist population and seeks autonomy for the region.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/09/02/df3eedc1-b6e9-4772-9fc5-3c955bdd14e8/thumbnail/620x414g2/92d873f20aee71bf04eb1ffb973fcd59/gettyimages-1000428958.jpg#\" alt=\"MYANMAR-MEDIA-RIGHTS-JUSTICE \" height=\"414\" width=\"620\" class=\" lazyload\" data-srcset=\"https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/09/02/df3eedc1-b6e9-4772-9fc5-3c955bdd14e8/thumbnail/620x414g2/92d873f20aee71bf04eb1ffb973fcd59/gettyimages-1000428958.jpg 1x, https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/09/02/df3eedc1-b6e9-4772-9fc5-3c955bdd14e8/thumbnail/1240x828g2/9a859fc593a43a550fec29b7530d42ec/gettyimages-1000428958.jpg 2x\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20414'%2F%3E\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104119", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close Trump ally, stepped up his criticism of the president Wednesday, telling “Fox & Friends” that if Trump “follows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency.” In tweets, Graham urged prayers for “our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,” adding, “This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.” He also said he would lead an effort in Congress to “make Erdogan pay a heavy price,” referring to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Another Trump ally, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a member of the GOP leadership, said she was sickened by the prospect of a Turkish incursion. “Impossible to understand,” she tweeted, why Trump “is leaving America’s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.” Trump argued   that “GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!” He said the U.S. went to war under a “false & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE!” Trump said he is “slowly & carefully” bringing home “our great soldiers & military,” in line with his campaign promise to do so. His call for ending U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and bringing the troops home was a feature of his presidential campaign, but it flies in the face of many decades of bipartisan American policy, even as the Trump administration and its immediate predecessor have tried to give additional attention to what they see as long-term security threats elsewhere, including from China and Russia. The U.S. has more than 10,000 troops based across the Middle East, including about 5,200 in Iraq, 1,000 in Syria and several thousand others at bases in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Also, the U.S. Navy’s Mideast headquarters is at Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. Just a couple of months ago the Pentagon reestablished a troop presence in Saudi Arabia after a lengthy absence, and in May it added air and naval forces in the region in response to what it views as worrying threats from Iran. As a further sign that the military does not share Trump’s view that the fight against the extremists is over, a press release Wednesday by the U.S.-led military coalition combating IS highlighted recent battlefield gains. It concluded by saying that “removing” IS fighters, weapons and bomb materials “remains a top priority” as the group “continues to plot attacks against innocent civilians and our partners throughout Iraq and northeast Syria.” Trump has long criticized President George W. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003, but the subsequent rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State has convinced many national security officials, and lawmakers such as Graham, that a precipitous U.S. troop withdrawal from the region would leave the U.S. and its allies even more vulnerable to extremism. Trump also claimed the U.S. has spent $8 trillion “fighting and policing” in the Middle East, up from the $7 trillion figure he has cited numerous times. Trump is using an inflated estimate on the cost of wars and referring in part to predicted costs going decades into the future, not money actually spent. Some of the spending also reflects his policy decisions he made since taking office nearly three years ago. Graham said Congress “will push back” against Turkey. He had said earlier this week that he was working on a bipartisan bill to sanction Turkey if they invade Syria. “We’re not giving Turkey a green light in Congress and we’re not going to abandon the Kurds,” he said. Trump announced Tuesday that he and Erdogan will meet at the White House on Nov. 13.", "image_url": "<img class=\"lazyload\" src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/themes/pbs-newshour/assets/img/placeholder.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-425x239.png 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-768x432.png 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/12/December-26-2020-Clean-1024x576.png 1024w\" alt=\"\">", "crawl_date": "2020-12-27 104119", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "", "length": "", "source": "scrapy"},

With an embarrassing loss in the first Test, all eyes will be on Rahane on how he would marshal his troops in search of a good show. The departure of Kohli also leaves a big void in the batting order, making it more vulnerable. However, former Indian cricketer Ajit Agarkar feels Rahane should bat high in the batting order to bring stability to the unit. “I think Rahane should promote himself to number four in Kohli’s absence. He has the experience and he has scored runs away from India. This is the time when a leader needs to stand up, I will be surprised if Rahane does not promote himself to number four,” Agarkar said. “I think Shubman Gill should play, I have been advocating for that for a while, he has the potential. I know he opens for Punjab in domestic cricket, but if someone like him does well, he can serve Indian cricket for a long time,” Agarkar added. Now you can get handpicked stories from   on everyday.

Elephants tend to have smaller sperm than mice because the larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length, a new study suggests. In the animal world, if several males mate with the same female, their sperm compete to fertilise her limited supply of eggs. Longer sperm often seem to have a competitive advantage.  However, the study conducted by researchers from the Universities of Zurich and Stockholm now shows that the size of the animals also matters. The larger the animal, the more important the number of sperm is relative to sperm length. That is why elephants have smaller sperm than mice, researchers said. Stefan Lupold from the University of Zurich and his colleague John Fitzpatrick from University of Stockholm compared the influence of sperm competition on the evolution of sperm in 100 mammalian species.  Unlike previous studies, however, they did not just consider sperm length, but also the number of sperm per ejaculate, which is important as the resources available for sperm production need to be shared between sperm size and number. In other words, the longer every individual sperm, the fewer of them a testicle of a certain size can produce. Earlier studies suggested that the number of sperm might be just as important as sperm length, if not even more so.  After all, the more sperm a male fields against his competitors, the greater the likelihood that one of them will win. Based on their joint consideration of sperm size and number, and with the aid of new meta-analytical methods, the researchers now show that species facing intense sperm competition invest more in their ejaculates on average than their monogamous counterparts. Moreover, they discovered that whether the length or the number of sperm is more important actually depends on the size of the animals.  The bigger the animal, the greater the selection pressure on the overall investments in ejaculates and the more important the number of sperm becomes compared to sperm length. This is due to the more voluminous female reproductive tract, in which the sperm tend to get lost or become \"diluted.\"  In larger species, sperm length or speed probably comes into effect only if a sufficient number of sperm manage to get near the egg, researchers said. In smaller species, however, the distance for sperm to cover is shorter and the risk of loss much smaller, allowing the advantage of longer sperm to manifest itself. As a result, you tend to find the most complex sperm forms in small species, not in large ones. For instance, small fruit flies have the longest sperm ever described, not whales, whose sperm are less than a tenth of a millimetre long and almost a thousand times shorter than those of the flies.

Certain industry players and experts have stated that the move to cap foreign direct investment (FDI) in digital media sector to 26 per cent throws up questions that need clarifications as some of those who were looking to raise funds could be restricted. There are mainly two issues -- how the FDI policy of the sector would treat news aggregators and what would happen to those digital media companies where overseas investment is over 26 per cent -- that need clarification. On these matters, the department is expected to issue clarification soon, a source said. The DPIIT has already taken views of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on the issue. Deloitte India Partner Jehil Thakkar had said that clarity was needed on how to treat cases of television broadcasters that stream news online, but are allowed 49 per cent FDI. \"What happens to those, whether they qualify under 26 per cent or 49 per cent (FDI)? What happens to news websites which are 100 per cent foreign entity?\" he said. Internet and Mobile Association of India too had sought clarification on the issue. In a representation to the DPIIT, it stated that the decision will have impact on startup ecosystem as continued FDI is critical to enable Indian digital media startups to achieve global scale. \"Several foreign strategic intermediaries have set up their operations in India, as digital media was categorized as 100 per cent FDI under the automatic route.

This was opposed by the IT department by challenging it before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The IT department has contended that by scheme of arrangement, the transferor company Reliance Jio Infocomm has sought to convert the redeemable preference shares into loans. According to it, conversion of equity into debt is not only contrary to the well settled principles of the company law but also would reduce the profitability or the net total income of the transferor company, causing a huge loss of revenue to the Income Tax Department.

Both the appeals are dismissed,\" the appellate tribunal said. Reliance Jio Infocomm submitted that it previously had separate units housing its optic fiber and tower infrastructure undertakings. Each of these units had distinct assets and liabilities and were involved in separate business. On April 2, Reliance Jio said that it has transferred control of its fibre and mobile tower units to two infrastructure investment trusts set up by Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL).
