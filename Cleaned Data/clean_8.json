Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed.\"", "text": "Brandon Bernard called and emailed me daily in the two months before his execution. We spoke a few hours before he was executed and some of our last words were spent discussing his last words. For the first time, his optimism was gone. Even the day before, he sounded hopeful because he had heard that the Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney  .  Brandon read his speech to the Pardon Office to me before presenting it, and the profound level of remorse he expressed brought me to tears. He was a different person from the teenager arrested over 20 years earlier. Up until the end, he did not think he would be executed because he knew he had reformed. I began writing to death row prisoners after reading Bryan Stevenson’s book   about an innocent man condemned to death row. Books often change my course; I read   a few years ago and haven’t eaten meat since. After reading “Just Mercy,” I sent out postcards to about a dozen death row inmates across the U.S. When I started what my husband, family and friends universally consider an odd hobby, I had no idea how gratifying and life-altering writing death row prisoners would become.   When we first began exchanging letters a year ago, I warned Brandon that I had one other pen pal at Terre Haute federal penitentiary. In my experience, inmates do not want to write someone with multiple pen pals at the same facility out of legitimate concerns over privacy and safety. Brandon’s immediate response was, “Well, then that makes me one of the two luckiest men at Terre Haute.” To call himself lucky after over   23 hours a day in a six-by-eight-foot cell was the first of many lessons in gratitude Brandon taught me. Brandon was 18 when he took part in a robbery gone wrong. He had no prior history of violence. Brandon’s friends carjacked a white couple, Todd and Stacey Bagley, youth ministers innocently offering a ride to kids purportedly in need. Later, Brandon rejoined the group only to see Christopher Vialva, the ringleader of the crime, fatally shoot Todd and Stacey in the head at close range. The man who had just shot two people in the head and still had a gun in his hand then ordered Brandon and three other teens to set the car on fire with the couple’s bodies inside.    At trial,  , meaning he offered the jury no alternative perspective on the charges. Brandon was the only accomplice not given an opportunity to plead guilty. The other accomplices pleaded out and received prison sentences; two are home with their families now.  Brandon was falsely portrayed as a hardened high-level gang member. Prosecutors suppressed evidence by their own gang expert that the gang had a 13-tier hierarchy with  . Brandon never got the chance to clarify his case in court — it remained the story poorly told at trial two decades earlier. Five of the nine surviving jurors  , stating that they would not have voted for the death penalty had prosecutors disclosed all facts at trial and had Brandon’s own lawyer competently defended him.   In her dissent written hours before Brandon’s execution, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor   “despite troubling allegations that the Government secured his death sentence by withholding exculpatory evidence and knowingly eliciting false testimony against him. [He] has never had the opportunity to test the merits of those claims in court. Now he never will.” Brandon became the youngest person, based on age when the offense occurred, to be put to death by the federal government in nearly 70 years,  . He was 40 when he died.  Brandon loved his life, even in its limited capacity on death row.   in his decades behind bars. This is no small feat given that death row is like a prison within a prison, with countless oppressive rules and ensuing frustrations.  Brandon mainly spent his time mentoring at-risk youth, reading, crocheting and playing the guitar. Brandon was calmer and more patient than most people I’ve come across; he spoke slowly and thoughtfully and was an avid listener. He never cursed and when I asked if that was for religious reasons, he said, “No, cursing just feels too aggressive to me.” A few days before his execution, Brandon’s family visited him for the last time.  After the visit, Brandon told me there was a hole in the pane of glass. I naively said, “Oh, so you were able to hold hands.” He explained it was an air hole to speak through, not large enough for hands, “But,” he said, “I could smell my mom.” In 20 years, including in his final days, Brandon was never allowed to physically touch a loved one. Never having physical contact is an inhumane daily assault on the soul. Brandon’s case fits the death row profile: His crime and trial took place in Texas, a state that has   of the national total. Brandon’s jury consisted of  . Brandon was Black — despite being 13% of the U.S. population, Blacks   of death row inmates. The victims are white in   of homicide death penalty cases. A recent   found that in executions involving interracial murders since 1976, 295 Black defendants were executed for killing white victims, while only 21 white defendants were executed for killing Black victims. Death row is riddled with racial bias and is disproportionately home to Black men   against a white person. Fairness cannot be achieved. Executions in our country, whether with rope or needle, have always been about race. President Joe Biden has   and to give incentives for states to do the same. There is a simple alternative to government executions: Keep people behind bars without resorting to killing them.   worldwide have abolished the death penalty. Italy abolished the death penalty in 1948;  . In the Netherlands, the last execution took place in 1952; Australia in 1967. Since ending the death penalty in 1976,  . The U.S. is the   to conduct executions. Even Russia stopped executions in 1996. Our country   with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt and Pakistan. We are very late in ending state-sponsored executions. It can be done; last month  . Brandon, with his typical positivity, would say now is the time. Friends sitting on death row for years have taught me many lessons: patience, keeping the conversation real and meaningful, and appreciating what I have.  The hassle of driving my daughter to school is now about holding her hand at stoplights and rolling the windows down so I can feel the air. The freedom. During our daily talks, I never had anything to offer Brandon other than my love and support. He never asked me for a single thing besides friendship. Brandon was religious, but since I’m not, I couldn’t offer him prayers or talk about how heaven is a better place. I could only helplessly listen and tell him that I love him.    were his deep regret to the victims’ families, his love for his own family and, true to his thoughtful nature, he told the prison guards not to let his execution upset them. Our final words to each other were about what he would visualize on the gurney to stay calm. I told him to imagine my arms holding him down instead of straps and he promised he would. I was crying and told him I was sorry I couldn’t save him. He said I saved him with my love.

Farooq Javed Khan, president of the Kashmir Photographers’ Association, said: “First of all, we have to verify if the statement attributed to the IGP in identical reports circulated by local news agencies is really his. And if he has used the phrase ‘don’t interfere’, then we would say it is obnoxious and, therefore, unacceptable.” He added: “While covering encounters and law and order situations we strictly follow the rulebook and never exceed our brief. If we are not allowed to discharge our professional responsibility, then what are we there for?”   The Kashmir Press Club and various Valley-based media organisations, in a joint statement, said the IGP’s statement has created anguish among the media. “If this is a part of the official policy of the police, it appears to be a tactic to coerce journalists into not reporting the facts on the ground. It also seems a part of the string of measures by the authorities to suppress freedom of the press in the region. Summoning journalists to police stations, filing FIRs and seeking informal explanations for their work has intensified in the past two years”, the statement said.   News agencies GNS and KNO reported that Mr Kumar advised media persons not to come close to encounter sites or “law and order” situations. “The media persons should not carry any live coverage of any encounter or law and order situation. Freedom of speech and expression is subject to reasonable restrictions that should not violate other persons’ right to life guaranteed under Article 21 or put national security in jeopardy. Do not interfere in the professional and bona fide duty of the police and security forces at encounter sites.”   He was also quoted as saying that no operational content should be carried that was “likely to incite violence or contains anything against the maintenance of law and order or which promotes anti-national sentiments.” The statement of the KPC and media organisations said: “Journalists in Kashmir have worked under tremendous pressure for the past several decades and despite facing threats to life, liberty and property, they upheld the principles of journalism and reporting.” The statement also adds: “The media in Kashmir is aware of journalistic guidelines and ethics for situations like encounters, law and order situations, and have always upheld these principles. Covering and reporting law and order situations in the region is one of the basic requirements for most news organisations, and hence an essential part of the professional role of the media. Barring them from covering such events would mean stopping them from delivering their professional duties.”   The statement further stated: “Press freedom is the cornerstone of a democracy and any attack on it undermines the democratic setup, of which the media is the fourth pillar. Any such attack on press freedom and journalism is highly distressful. In this backdrop, journalist bodies in Kashmir urge Mr Kumar to put the record straight and clarify the statement attributed to him.” It is pertinent to note that images of the security forces targeting private houses and other buildings in which militants were holed up during counter-insurgency operations went viral recently. It was alleged that the security forces used flame-inducing gunpowder, mortar shells and IEDs in such actions and the resultant devastation has been seen by critics as a step to punish the alleged abettors and supporters of militants.   The security forces’ officials reject this criticism as unwarranted, and say it is unavoidable collateral damage, which they claim they try to keep under check. They also claim that the media’s presence, particularly that of photographers and videographers, further provokes protesters near the encounter sites and leaders to more stone-pelting for the benefit of the cameras. Last week, a video showing a policeman kicking a press photographer near an encounter site in southern Pulwama district also went viral and evoked much criticism of the police.  ", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162231", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "17893", "source": "scrapy"},

The move comes even as India's drug regulator has extended Covishield's shelf life from six to nine months from its manufacturing date. In a recent communique to Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the WHO has also asked the firm to formulate the doses with enough titer and/or implement a higher specification at release so that the minimum specification of= 2.5 x108ifu/dose is fulfilled throughout the shelf life. Shelf life is the length of time for which an item remains fit for use. The DCGI in a letter to SII in February said it has no objection in respect of 'extension of shelf life of Covishield vaccine' in a multi-dose glass vial (10 dose-5ml) from six months to nine months. \"You are permitted to apply the shelf life of nine months to unlabelled vials available on hand, subject to the condition that the details of such stock, batch-wise, shall be submitted to this office and Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli,\" DCGI Dr V G Somani had said in the letter. The DCGI's decision will help health authorities in reducing vaccine wastage. According to an update by the UK drug regulator dated February 22, the shelf-life of the AstraZeneca   vaccine is six months. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the vaccine as the European Union's health agency concluded a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and rare blood clots but stressed that the benefits of the vaccine to protect against   continue to outweigh the risks. The UK's medicines regulator on Wednesday said that under-30s in the country will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to \"evolving evidence\" linking it to rare blood clots.

The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to prepare for the launch of such workplace vaccination. According to news agency  , Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a letter to the chief secretaries said a substantial proportion of the population aged 45 years and above is in the organised sector of the economy and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private) or manufacturing and services. \"In order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations,   vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing COVID vaccination centre,\" Bhushan said in the letter . He said the states can initiate due consultations with private/public sector employers and management to prepare for launch of workplace vaccination. \"Such workplace vaccination centres may be launched across states/Union Territories from 11 April, 2021,\" he said. The Centre has asked states and Union Territories to make adequate preparations and issued guidelines in this regard. According to the government's guidance note, workplace vaccination sessions may be organised to facilitate optimal utilization of vaccine dosage and reduce wastage. \"Organizing vaccination at the workplace will not only be convenient to the staff at workplaces but also help to avoid travel and hence reducing the risk of exposure to   virus,\" it said. According to the guidelines, only employees aged 45 years or more will be eligible for vaccination at workplaces and no outsiders including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination. One of the senior staff of the organisation will be assigned to work as nodal officer to coordinate with district health authorities/ private COVID vaccination centres (CVCs) and support vaccination activities. The beneficiaries will be required to register in Co-WIN portal prior to vaccination and CVC nodal officer will ensure registration of all targeted beneficiaries and facility of on-the-spot registration will also be available but only to employees of the workplace, the guidelines said. Once identified, the workplace   vaccination centres will also have to register on the Co-WIN portal as government or private CVC at workplace. For optimal utilisation of resources, vaccination sessions will be planned at workplace CVC once at least 50 beneficiaries get registered for vaccination. \"The schedule of vaccination sessions can be made up to 15 days in advance and intimated to the workplaces so that maximum attendance is ensured on the day of vaccination. In most of the workplaces vaccination schedules may, however, be completed in less than 15 days,\" the Centre told states and union territories in the guidelines. The District Task Force chaired by district magistrate and Urban Task Force chaired by municipal commissioner will identify such government and private workplaces after due deliberations with relevant employers. Every CVC in a government workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the government medical facility while every CVC in a private workplace will be tagged to an existing and nearest CVC in the private medical facility. The designated government and private CVC to whom the workplace CVC has been tagged will be responsible for the deployment of the vaccination team at workplace CVCs. All government and private CVCs are already linked to some cold chain points for receiving vaccines. \"These CVCs will continue to use the same mechanism to receive the vaccine needed for vaccination at tagged workplace CVC,\" the guidelines said. \"Some of the work places may have health infrastructure in form of hospitals, health clinics, nursing centers, etc. This infrastructure may be utilized to set-up vaccination site in case sufficient space for waiting, vaccination and observation rooms are available,\" the guidelines stated. The healthcare workers of this health infrastructure of the workplace CVCs (such as doctors, nurses and other staff) may be deployed for the   vaccination activities at workplaces as vaccination team members, it said. The workplace CVCs staff engaged in   vaccination activities will follow the same SOPs for vaccination and reporting including management and reporting of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). The government has also spelled out the requirements for AEFI management at the workplace CVCs.

Its UK counterpart, however, said it would offer people under 30 the choice of another product. The European Medicines Agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. It said most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination — but based on the currently available evidence, it was not able to identify specific risk factors. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the United Kingdom, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine. “The reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine,” said Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director. But it placed no new age restrictions on using the vaccine in people 18 and over, as some countries have done. “The risk of mortality from COVID is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects.,” Cooke said. Dr. June Raine, the head of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, echoed that sentiment, saying that the benefits “continue to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people.” She called the unusual clots a “potential side effect” of the vaccine and said the evidence was “firming up,” but more study was needed to be sure. The EMA, the World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against   outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots. The announcements could have far-reaching effects on the use of the shot that is key to global efforts to end the pandemic. The EMA's investigation was particularly focused on two types of rare blood clots: one that appears in multiple blood vessels and another that occurs in a vein that drains blood from the brain. It also evaluated reports of people who had low levels of blood platelets, which puts them at risk of severe bleeding. As recently as last week, the EMA said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population” — a response to several countries doing just that — though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected. In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine. Meanwhile, Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, never suspended use of the vaccine. The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic. Dr Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine globally could have serious consequences. “We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said. That’s because the vaccine is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries. It has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine. The governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region had said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot. “If they do like Germany, and allow Astra Zeneca only to people over 65, that would be absurd. Before it was only for people under 55. Put yourself in the place of citizens, it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters on Wednesday. The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary. “If there are in fact individuals of a certain age group that could have a higher risk (of clotting) then we need to adjust its use,” Casado told Spanish public radio. “We are not questioning AstraZeneca. We need all the vaccines possible to reach the goal of 70% of the adult population.” French health authorities said they, too, were awaiting EMA’s conclusions and would follow the agency’s recommendations, especially for the 500,000 people who have received the first dose of AstraZeneca. Even officials in Asia said they were keen to hear the EMA's decision. On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said it would also pause a vaccine rollout to school nurses and teachers that was to begin on Thursday while awaiting the outcome of the EMA’s review. English, the former chair of a British Medical Association committee, said that even rare, serious side effects are seen with established vaccines and that policymakers often decide that bigger public health goals warrant their use, citing the polio vaccine as an example. For every million doses that are given of the oral polio vaccine, about one child is paralyzed from the live virus contained in the vaccine. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which developed the vaccine, paused a study of the shot in children while the U.K. regulator evaluates the link between the shot and rare blood clots in adults.", "image_url": "<img class=\"fp-lazy\" title=\"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\" alt=\"AstraZeneca vaccine: EU regulator confirms unusual blood clots as 'very rare' side effect, but says jab still safe\" src=\"https://www.firstpost.com/static/images/fplogo_placeholder_640x362.jpg\" data-src=\"//images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/astrazeneca-AP.jpg?impolicy=website&amp;width=640&amp;height=363\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162232", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "", "length": "42385", "source": "scrapy"},

In a letter to all states/Union territories, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said this was done since a substantial proportion of the 45-plus population are in the organised sector of the economy and work in offices (private or government), or in manufacturing and services. He added that to increase access to vaccines for such people, Covid-19 sessions may be held at workplaces that have 100 or more willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with the existing Covid vaccination centres and asking the states to launch this scheme by Sunday.   This change in the government’s plan comes as the desired target for vaccinations is yet to be achieved. The change of strategy comes amid the raging debate on vaccine availability. On Wednesday, the Maharashtra government claimed it faced a shortage of vaccines and at present had vaccine doses only for the next three days, and some vaccination centres have to be shut due to this. Maharashtra has the highest number of Covid positive cases in the country. “Stocks of vaccine in the state and in Mumbai are only for the next three days. Today 14 lakh doses are available, which means there is only three days’ stock. Every week we need 40 lakh doses, that is if we vaccinate five lakh people every day. We requested the Centre to send more vaccines as this is the state with the highest number of cases every day,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope. He said he had told Union health minister Harsh Vardhan about this during a videoconference on Tuesday evening.   However, Dr Harsh Vardhan said: “I have seen statements by public representatives in Maharashtra about the shortage of vaccines. This is nothing but an attempt to divert attention from the Maharashtra government’s repeated failures to control the spread of the pandemic. The inability of the Maharashtra government to act responsibly is beyond comprehension. To spread panic among people is to compound the folly further. Vaccine supplies are monitored on a real-time basis, and state governments are being apprised regularly about it. Allegations about a vaccine shortage are utterly baseless.”   He added: “Throughout last year, as health minister of India, I have been a witness to the misgovernance and utterly casual approach of the Maharashtra government in battling the virus. The lackadaisical attitude of the state government has singularly bogged down the entire country’s efforts to fight the virus. We, in the Central government, have regularly counselled the Maharashtra government, made them available all resources and sent Central teams for help. However, the lack of effort by the state government is now clearly visible and comes to haunt us all. Today, Maharashtra not only has the highest cases and deaths in the country but also has one of the highest test positivity rates in the world! Their testing is not up to the mark and their contact tracing leaves a lot to be desired. The performance of the Maharashtra government in terms of vaccinating healthcare workers and frontline workers is also not great. It is shocking to see how the state government is putting Maharashtrians in danger by letting people escape institutional quarantine mandates. As the state lurched from one crisis to another, it seems the state leadership is happily sleeping at the wheel.”   He said the Maharashtra government must do a lot more to control the pandemic, adding that the Centre will help in all possible ways. The minister also referred to Chhattisgarh, saying the comments by state leaders were intended to spread misinformation and panic about the vaccinations. “Chhattisgarh has seen a disproportionately higher number of deaths in the last 2-3 weeks. Their testing remains heavily dependent on rapid antigen tests, which is not a wise strategy. The state government in fact refused to use Covaxin despite it being given emergency use authorisation by the Drugs Controller of India. Not only this, by its actions, the state government leaders have the dubious distinction of being perhaps the only government in the world to have incited vaccine hesitancy,” Dr Vardhan added.   The minister said many other states also need to bring their healthcare systems up to the mark, mentioning Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat, saying they need to improve the quality of testing. In Punjab, he said, the high case fatality rate must be improved by early identification of those needing hospitalisation. Mask-wearing and social distancing compliance are slack in several states. The minister also defended the government’s stand of vaccinating only 45-plus people as of now. Health ministry officials had said Tuesday that the vaccine strategy was to cover those who needed it, and not those who want it. However, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticised this strategy on Wednesday, saying: “It is ridiculous to debate needs and wants. Every Indian deserves the chance to a safe life.”   India on Wednesday had about 1.16 lakh fresh Covid-19 cases, while 630 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. Due to rising cases, the Punjab government ordered a night curfew in the state from 9 pm till 5 am and a ban on all political, social, cultural and sports gatherings. A cap was also put on the numbers permitted at weddings, funerals and cremations. Only 50 people can attend indoor functions, and 100 outdoors. In Chhattisgarh, a lockdown has been imposed in Raipur from April 9 to 19. The Serum Institute of India, that is making the Covishield vaccine in India, has got a legal notice from its partner AstraZeneca over delays in vaccine supplies. India has halted the export of vaccines to other nations in order to first cover its own population.   Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawala said: “The globe needs this vaccine... We are prioritising the needs of India (but) we are still short of being able to supply every Indian.” He added more companies need to manufacture vaccines in India to meet the demand.", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.deccanchronicle.com/images/archives.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162234", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html", "language": "", "length": "18782", "source": "scrapy"},

In a statement made at the 46  Session of the Human Rights Council on Wednesday, Cambodia Ambassador and Permanent Representative Sokkhoeurn An said that his country had accepted six Special Rapporteurs over the last three decades, proving its open engagement with the agency and processs, but that “cooperation is a two-way process.” He said that Special Procedure Mandate Holders (SPMHs) are expected to perform their duties “in an objective, impartial, non-selective and non-politicized manner,” and suggested that experts should adhere to their code of conduct by “establishing facts duly cross-checked.” Sokkhoeurn An also urged SPMHs to assist states in the field of human rights “through genuine dialogues and cooperation with non-judicial character of the reports and conclusion, bearing in mind the national particularities of each country.” Lastly, the representative said that SPMHs should provide advice on requested technical cooperation and capacity building assistance “with a view to addressing the underlying conditions rather than attending only to the symptoms.” “To conclude, only with due diligence to the said protocols will the SPMHs earn trust from the states,” he said. Sokkhoeurn An’s statement follows the recent appointment by the U.N. Human Rights Council of Thailand’s Vitit Muntarbhorn to the role of Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Cambodia, following the end of a five-year mandate by his predecessor Rhona Smith in January. Muntarbhorn, an international law professor, had previously served as the first U.N. Independent Expert on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity for the Human Rights Council. Smith’s tenure as Special Rapporteur was marked by frequent sparring with Cambodia’s government over issues related to the September 2017 arrest of opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) President Kem Sokha for “treason” and the disbanding of his party for its role in the alleged plot two months later. The move to dissolve the CNRP marked the beginning of a wider crackdown by Hun Sen on the political opposition, NGOs, and the independent media that paved the way for his ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) to win all 125 seats in the country’s July 2018 general election. In November, the Phnom Penh Municipal Court summoned at least 113 individuals connected to the CNRP to stand trial together, most of whom face charges of conspiracy and incitement to sow chaos in society—crimes punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The prospect of a rapid mass trial of the opposition prompted Smith to express serious concerns in a statement ahead of the proceedings, which she said appeared to be “politically motivated, lacking clear legal grounds and constitute a serious violation of the due process rights, firmly established by international human rights law.” Underscoring the difficulties the new U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights will face in Phnom Penh, the Siem Reap Provincial Court jailed three more CNRP activists Thursday to five years in prison over a “conspiracy to topple the government” after they spoke out against Hun Sen’s government. One of the three, an activist named Chhun Vean who is currently seeking asylum in neighboring Thailand, dismissed the verdict as “laughable” in an interview with RFA’s Khmer Service. “It proves that the court is a tool of the Phnom Penh regime to persecute the opposition party,” he said. Chhun Vean said that the sentence would only motivate him to work harder to “bring democracy to Cambodia.” Sam Sokong, a lawyer representing the three activists, told RFA that his clients were innocent of the crime they were charged with and were only expressing their personal opinions, as is their right under Cambodia’s constitution. He vowed to appeal the verdict.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162231", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "11935", "source": "scrapy"},

A statement from the ministry said that one of the two patients who died Friday is Noun Sophany, the 65-year-old wife of popular Cambodian crooner Hour Lavy. She was known to have been suffering from chronic diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. The second patient was identified as a 46-year-old Cambodian male from the capital Phnom Penh’s Toul Kork district. Doctors told the Khmer Times that he did not have any other serious health problems and that the main cause of his death with COVID-19. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. Prime Minister Hun Sen said Friday that some 300,000 people have already been inoculated with vaccine from China-based Sinopharm and U.K.-based Astra Zeneca. The latter’s vaccine, he said, is being prioritized for people 60 years of age and older, although “some hospitals in Phnom Penh vaccinated people who are younger than 60, which goes against distribution policy.” Hun Sen said he had bought 1.5 million additional Sinopharm doses which are expected to arrive in Cambodia by late March, and another batch of 400,000 doses expected in April. He made the comments while touring a new 500-bed hospital on the outskirts of Phnom Penh that is designated solely for COVID-19 patients. However, members of the public have been critical of Hun Sen’s plans to purchase vaccines from Sinopharm, saying they only trust vaccines that have been recognized by the WHO. They have also called for a distribution plan free from bias.  The update on COVID-19 deaths and efforts to battle the coronavirus came as Cambodia recorded 30 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, bringing the total number of cases across the country since the beginning of the pandemic to 1,578, while the Ministry of Health warned that a Feb. 20 community event that “breached quarantine” is expected to raise the total number to more than 1,600 by Saturday. Earlier this week, Cambodia reported a daily record of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. On Friday, the Ministry of Health issued a joint statement with the WHO, warning that Cambodia is “at a critical point in the fight against COVID-19.” “The current COVID-19 situation in Cambodia remains serious. What we do right now will determine the course of this outbreak,” Minister of Health Mam Bunheng said. “We must accelerate our efforts to stop the spread of [the coronavirus] in the coming days and weeks. Lives depend on it.” Li Ailan, WHO representative to Cambodia, warned that COVID-19 can “affect anyone at any time.” “The country is at a critical stage of fighting against COVID-19, but we have a window of opportunity to stop virus spread if we all act together with solidarity,” Li said. The statement urged Cambodian to “follow the 3 do’s and the 3 don’ts” of wearing masks properly, washing hands frequently, and maintaining a distance of at least six feet from others, while abstaining from entering places with poor ventilation, joining crowds, and touching others. It warned that large scale transmission could require largescale restrictions and lockdowns and would likely cause hospitals and health facilities to become overwhelmed, making it difficult for people with COVID-19 and other health conditions to receive care. Earlier this week, the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner in Cambodia (OHCHR Cambodia) warned that discrimination against people who have contracted COVID-19 can often prove more dangerous than the disease itself. In a post to Facebook, the OHCHR said that “hate speech spreads faster than [the coronavirus] and makes those targeted more vulnerable to violence, exclusion, isolation and stigmatization” and deters them from accessing medical services, increasing the risks for everyone.” The OHCHR’s message came after several social media users took to Facebook to attack people, including film stars, for allegedly spreading the coronavirus amid the recent outbreak.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162234", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12075", "source": "scrapy"},

Billed as Singapore’s first “smart” clubhouse, it is equipped with digital capabilities and includes eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, an auto-irrigation system and an eco-filtrated swimming pool. The clubhouse, which was progressively opened to national servicemen (NSmen) and the public from Aug 1, 2020, hosts Singapore’s only Peranakan-themed indoor playground and an indoor player versus player airsoft area. It also contains Singapore’s largest multi-installation indoor hub, HomeTeamNS said in a media release. Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam, who is also the chairman of HomeTeamNS’ board of governors, said: “HomeTeamNS Khatib is the first of the modern, new look Home Team clubhouses. We wanted the best in design, facilities, and technology.” Minister of State for Home Affairs and president of HomeTeamNS Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim added: “The opening of Khatib Clubhouse has been very well received by our members, scoring well above the industry norm in customer satisfaction. “We have seen a marked increase in membership sign ups and renewals among members residing in the North from October 2020 to March 2021 compared to the same period a year before.” On Saturday, Mr Shanmugam and Associate Professor Faishal also presented 20 NSmen with their meritorious and long service awards. A HomeTeamNS app was developed “to bring the traditional clubhouse experience online” amid the COVID-19 pandemic, HomeTeamNS said. “Improving the clubhouse’s digital presence through the website and the mobile application also added a new dimension to HomeTeamNS’ identity and helped it better connect with a younger generation of NSmen,” it added. The app allows members to monitor real-time occupancy rates, book facilities remotely and provides digital, contactless access to enter the facilities. Chief executive of HomeTeamNS Agnes Eu said: “We focused our efforts on enhancing the HomeTeamNS experience for our NSmen, bridging their online and offline journey seamlessly through this app. “They are able to check the capacity of our various facilities in real time create instant bookings and upon arrival, scan their QR codes for entry.

Individuals who visited the KTV lounge on the same day as the COVID-19 cases were tested for the coronavirus as a “precautionary measure”, said the Ministry of Health. All 322 people tested negative. HomeTeamNS said last year the doors to the KTV lounge were not closed because of “ongoing minor works” that “inadvertently allowed passers-by to enter to view the interior layout”. \"Neither HomeTeamNS nor Jewel Music Box KTV made any arrangements nor extended any invitations to visitors at the clubhouse to view the KTV’s premises on Aug 1 and Aug 2,\" added HomeTeamNS.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162234", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "45259", "source": "scrapy"},

By stating he would no longer be head of the fourth-generation (4G) team of leaders in Government, Mr Heng has thrown the question of who will succeed PM Lee wide open yet again. Mr Heng, a career civil servant until he contested in the 2011 General Election (GE), had been chosen as the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) First Assistant Secretary-General in November 2018. In April 2019, he was appointed Singapore’s sole DPM, signifying that there had been a consensus among the 4G team that Mr Heng should lead them and the country. With these developments, Mr Heng, was in all senses, the PM-designate. He was even handed the task of Acting PM in the absence of PM Lee. When he brought his East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) to a slim victory after an 11th hour switch from his stronghold in Tampines GRC in GE2020, some were generous to say that he successfully held off a rout by the Workers’ Party. A second camp argued he had been wounded by his performance and wondered if the party might review his suitability as the nation’s next leader. They might think their instinct was right when Mr Heng said he was stepping aside for a new leader but he has also debunked this perceived link: “The results in the GE2020 performance, in particular, in East Coast GRC, is not the reason why I decided to step aside,” he said at the media conference on Thursday. In response to DPM Heng’s announcement, the 4G leaders said in a statement on Thursday “this unexpected turn of events is a setback for our succession planning”. Given that PM Lee also said he would be announcing a Cabinet reshuffle in two weeks’ time, the question arises: Why was it not possible to pair the announcements to give the assurance to citizens that there would be, nonetheless, forward momentum in the process of leadership renewal? Since PM Lee said there would be consequential shifts, would those whose political stocks rise – a second DPM, a new Minister for Finance or even a new Defence Minister, for instance, give indication of who the PAP might test as a replacement for Mr Heng. But whose choice would that be? While the two-week interregnum may cause the rumour mills to go into overdrive, can the matter of who the 4G leaders wish to select be settled quite so quickly? Should it? Having said that, if current Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing, who is also Second Assistant Secretary-General of the PAP, were to be placed in the powerful Finance Minister role, it could be taken as a forgone conclusion that Mr Chan is next in line to succeed PM Lee. This would be the fastest way to resolve the succession question. Like Mr Heng, Mr Chan entered Government with the 2011 GE. He has held a few full ministerial portfolios but most unusually, has had a tour of duty outside of mainstream government as the country’s labour chief - Secretary-General at the National Trades Union Congress. He has also been developing his international exposure through a collaborative project between the Government and that of Chongqing province in the People’s Republic of China. His previous incarnation as a Major-General and Chief of Army in the Singapore Armed Forces will have afforded him defence networks in the region and also in the United States where he was the first foreign graduate to be conferred the Distinguished Master Strategist Award by the prestigious Army Command and General Staff College. In his current portfolio as Industry and Trade Minister during the pandemic, Minister Chan has worked overtime to secure multilateral trade arrangements and ensure that international trade lines remain open. However, at Thursday’s press conference on Mr Heng’s announcement, Mr Chan and Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung - another 4G member touted to be a contender for the premiership - said that the 4G team will need time to consider afresh and “holistically” who might be most suited to be the “captain of the team” using Ong’s preferred metaphor.  In other words, the most obvious choice may not be the answer. What is at stake here? The deleterious public health and economic effects of COVID-19, Mr Heng, explained, would require several years to recede.  PM Lee has also previously acknowledged this while assuring Singaporeans that he will see Singapore through the current crisis and is “determined to hand over Singapore, intact and in good working order, to the next team”. If he only took over as premier then, Mr Heng would already be in his mid-60s. Sixty-five, we know, is the age when Singapore’s first PM Lee Kuan Yew had wanted to stand down and also two years older than when its second PM, Goh Chok Tong, transferred premiership to the current PM.  This would not have given Mr Heng a long enough runway to govern before the handover to the next leader is expected. This cycle of leadership succession would have started again all too soon. Precious time has been lost to the pandemic since the PM-in-waiting was also limited in his ability to travel overseas to strengthen his standing in the international community. From the disruptions that emanate from US-China relations and the domestic political instability within some of our Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncertainty about how ASEAN can continue to provide ballast for peace, stability and security in the region, which Singapore relies on, is something PM Lee’s successor must be prepared to address.  This person must have a certain level of exposure and experience in operating on that plane. In that regard, the two former Principal Private Secretaries to the current PM, Mr Ong and Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who are on the other hand 51 and 48 years old respectively, may also have some help to draw upon.  They can ride on the networks they have built from that role as well as the tutelage of the current PM - much like Mr Heng could, given that he played the same role to Singapore’s first PM. The advantage might go to Mr Wong, who has built a high and favourable public profile as co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 and clearly has the confidence of DPM Heng, serving as the latter’s Second Minister of Finance since August 2016. If on the other hand, the 4G privileges a leader’s standing domestically and more importantly, his or her ability to motivate to inspire peers and citizens, the people-oriented Minister for National Development Desmond Lee at 44 years of age may be given more time to prove himself. Ironically, this process of readying these individuals and testing the dynamics among the 4G leaders without Mr Heng in the picture will indeed take time. The next PAP Conference and GE may even be needed as barometers of support among cadres and citizens. With PM Lee to provide the firm and steady leadership through the severe and immediate COVID-19 challenge, the best way forward is to take a step back to watch how these candidates continue to interact with Singaporeans, their international counterparts and each other before a new successor is announced.", "image_url": "<img class=\"picture__image\" src=\"/blob/10586236/bf96a54634b0637b0f830fbf41a3019f/gillian-koh-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Koh\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162235", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=UTF-8", "language": "en-US", "length": "48791", "source": "scrapy"},

According to the Ministry of Health, 75-year-old retired doctor Sderng Chea was admitted to the Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital in the capital Phnom Penh on Sunday with a severe lung infection and died a day later from complications related to COVID-19. Sderng Chea had served as the chairman of the Medical and Sports Science Committee of the National Olympic Committee of Cambodia. RFA’s Khmer Service was unable to reach Ministry of Health spokeswoman Or Vandine for comment on the country’s fourth COVID-19 death, but she told local media that before his arrival at the hospital, Sderng Chea was in “critical condition.” Speaking to Bayon TV, Or Vandine said that the spread of the coronavirus is “on the rise” in Cambodia, affecting both children and the elderly, and suggested that a “vicious new mutation” is making it more difficult for medical professionals to treat the infected. She warned the public not to doubt the seriousness of the virus or to assume it is a hoax. “Some people say they don’t believe it is a real virus or a pandemic, and claim it is an organized scam,” she said. “Let me ask you, how can you organize and fabricate the number of dead? We must realize this is the life of a person, not a joke, but some people are falling victim to fake propaganda.” So far, seven people have died while being treated for COVID-19, but the Ministry of Health only acknowledges that four people—including Sderng Chea—have died of the disease. The ministry claims that the other three deaths were caused by heart disease and severe pneumonia. Cambodia marked its first official death from COVID-19 on March 11, a year to the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled the coronavirus a global pandemic. While the country has remained relatively unscathed by the virus, it reported a daily record last week of 105 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the country’s total number of infections to 1,430—nearly triple that of a month ago when the latest outbreak was first detected. By Monday, the number of infections had climbed to 1,753. Despite the month-long outbreak, it was only on March 20 that Cambodia’s government issued an order closing the country’s schools and entertainment venues—including cinemas, theaters, and museums. However, factories—which have recorded an increase of cases among staff—remain open with workers commuting crammed together in the backs of trucks daily. Social development analyst Seng Sary told RFA that the public has become more vigilant as the death toll has increased. But he urged the government to work harder to prevent the spread of the virus, saying it is imperative for both authorities and the public to cooperate. “There are still some citizens who neglect the safety rules and hold small gatherings,” he said. “But mostly, we have started to see people become more cautious … after seeing four people die. I hope we all take more caution.” Also on Monday, Cambodia’s lesser-known opposition Grassroot Democratic Party (GDP) called on the government to devise specific plans to address the recent outbreak and the national economy, which has suffered during the pandemic, particularly due to rising unemployment. The party, which lacks a seat in the National Assembly, urged the government in a statement to respond in a timely manner, including by establishing a commission to study key issues, such as targeted assistance, the informal economy, the return of migrant workers from abroad, and how much of the national budget should be allocated to helping to support the livelihood of the people and facilitate debt repayment.  In addition, the GDP called for a commission to study farming production that can help the economy rebound and create local jobs, as well as how the business community can assist in a national recovery after the threat of the coronavirus is over. GDP founder Yang Saing Koma told RFA that the government’s current measures are insufficient and called for a “clear, master plan” that promotes contributions from all parties and development partners. “This is not about the Grassroot Democratic Party, it’s about the whole nation and its need to respond to the current problems—especially how we can quickly recover our economy and tourism sector after the crisis.” Ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) spokesman Sok Eysan called the GDP’s statement a “political ploy,” adding that the government already has control of the situation. He noted that the government has set up quarantine centers, as well as provided food and additional funding to the public. “Those who have political motives against the government were chosen to be interviewed, such as motorbike taxi drivers, and then their interviews were broadcast on Radio Free Asia,” he said. “Therefore, the problem seems unsolvable.” “I follow RFA closely. I’m on top of the situation and I regularly compare between the news broadcasts and the reality in Cambodia.” Sok Eysan did not elaborate on how the two situations differ. The World Bank recently warned that, because of the pandemic, poverty in 2020 could increase among households involved in key sectors like tourism, construction, trade, manufacturing and the garment industry.", "image_url": null, "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162234", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "12480", "source": "scrapy"},

The coup on Feb. 1 that overthrew the country’s elected government followed a year of deepening economic distress from a shutdown of economic activity to control the spread of the coronavirus. Myanmar is Southeast Asia’s poorest country, with nominal per capita GDP of about U.S. $1,300. Measures to fight the pandemic, which flared up this past winter, hit households and businesses, including those in the agricultural sector, which accounts for one-fifth of GDP and over half of employment. The coup and mass civil disobedience against the junta have further dampened economic activity. Military restrictions on transportation and security barriers set up on major roadways nationwide have choked the country’s flow of food and other goods into cities and suburban areas. Soldiers stationed along major roadways often confiscate cargo and cash from drivers and motorcyclists in the Sagaing and Mandalay regions — two of Myanmar largest population centers — merchants told RFA. Security forces are stopping all traffic that passes through most towns in the two regions and inspecting vehicles, they said. “[Our] car was stopped last evening in Kyaukpadaung, Mandalay, and 500,000 kyats [U.S. $350] was taken from a handbag on the car’s dashboard,” said a person who witnessed the theft, but wanted to remain anonymous. “We told them we were civil servants, and they said they didn’t care and just took the money.” Similar incidents were reported in Sagaing region in the country’s northwest, where police and troops seized food from shops in markets and shopping malls without paying, traders said. They also stole goods from vehicles they inspected, resulting in fewer cargo trucks moving though the region. “It’s not easy to transport goods now because (troops) are everywhere, and we don’t know if we can proceed or not,” said a trader in Monywa, Sagaing’s largest city. “The cars can go on only when they say so. Even then, they sometimes will take stuff.” The trader said he recently saw security forces take a box of snacks from a vehicle during a security check. “Life is quite difficult,” he added. Only about two of every 100 truck drivers are now moving cargo through the region, the trader said. Not only do security forces check every part of the trucks, they also ask questions if they find a lot of cash, inquiring where the money came from and who will receive it, and then sometimes take the money for themselves, he said. The economic pinch is also being felt in Yangon, the most populous city in Myanmar, whose citizens rely on deliveries of goods from outside the urban center for their household and business needs. Disruptions in the flow of consumer goods means that neighborhood markets have little meat or vegetables to sell, while prices for the products have doubled, said one Yangon homemaker. “In Yangon, only the big supermarkets like City Mart and Metro are operating as usual, and the smaller shops and stores are all closed,” she said. “Only about half the regular amount of meat and veggies is available, and you have to buy them whether you like it or not as we don’t have the opportunity to choose what we want,” she said. “Prices have increased twofold, threefold, or more.” The number of cargo trucks entering the commercial center’s largest wholesale markets have dropped by two-thirds, while prices of daily necessities have increased, said a rice seller in Yangon. At the Bayinnaung Market in rice deliveries have fallen by about two-thirds, though shops are open as usual, a rice merchant said. The market for foodstuffs will remain stable for now, but if the flow of basic foods and commodities stops and storage supplies are exhausted, prices will skyrocket, traders said. The struggle to stay fed and supplied plays out amid live-and-death battles in the streets, as heavily armed security forces suppress demonstrators and ordinary citizens alike, often firing indiscriminately into crowds or dwellings. At least three civilians had been wounded by gunfire within 24 hours up to midday on Tuesday and an unknown number of people had been arrested since early morning, including four medical doctors in Mandalay. Soldiers and police detained the doctors as they prepared for a protest on 73rd Street in memory of their fallen colleagues. One man was hit in the arm when police fired live rounds during the crackdown, and officers arrested two pediatricians and two other doctors, and confiscated motorcycles and cell phones from the protesters, witnesses said. “They arrived in a truck while we were preparing to stage a dawn protest,” said one physician at the scene who declined to be named. “They fired stun grenades five times near the university campus. Afterwards, two pediatricians and two other doctors got arrested, and three motorcycles were taken away.” Though local health department workers and other anti-junta protesters have held early morning demonstrations, this was the first time that police took action against them, those at the scene said. In the Kachin state town of Mogaung, a woman was hit in the arm by gunfire on Monday evening while counting her day’s earnings in her shop, witnesses said. She was shot by troops and police stationed on the bridge across the Nangyin River near her neighborhood. Security forces also shot another man on a motorbike when he tried to turn around at the bridge, witnesses said. “There were five or six shots, and one of the first shots hit the woman,” said a local resident. “The last shot hit the guy on the motorbike, slightly wounding him.” A family member of the woman who was shot said a military officer apologized for the shooting Tuesday morning and offered to take her to a military hospital in Kachin’s capital Myitkyina. Local residents said they wanted the troops to leave the bridge. Security forces continued heir searches for protest leaders in other parts of Myanmar, sometimes resorting to their arresting their relatives. When police in Thayarwaddy, a city in the central Bago region, couldn’t find Jar Lay, an anti-coup protest leader, they arrested his family of six, including a four-year-old daughter, a toddler niece, and a 13-year-old brother-in-law. The six were released on Tuesday, but Jar Lay told RFA from his hiding place that police beat his teenage brother-in-law on the side of his head during an interrogation. “An informer told police we had explosives and weapons hidden in the house which was not true, and troops came to search for them at about 3 a.m.,” he said. “My entire family, including my kids and my in-laws, was taken to a military camp.” The teenager, who was hit in the temples and on his ears, was questioned about why he shared posts and photos on social media from his cell phone, Jar Lay said. “He was later taken to a police station and was forced to sign a confession,” he said. Before their release, the relatives had to sign a pledge that they would help police capture Jar Lay, and that if he could not be found, they would be rearrested, Jar Lay said. Security forces are even rounding up domestic celebrities who may not have played a part in the protests. Soldiers and police arrested famous comedian Zarganar in Yangon’s Tamwe township Tuesday morning, according to Facebook posts by his colleagues Ngapyaw Gyaw and Kaung Gyaw. Zaganar is not on the list of those subject to police warrants, so it is not yet known what he has been charged with or where he is being detained, they said. Throughout the country, protests against the junta continued in various forms in Mandalay, the Yangon suburbs, and in other cities and towns. Anti-junta protesters added color to their rallies Tuesday by smearing red paint on streets and pavements in the commercial hub Yangon to signal their opposition to the military regime’s bloody crackdowns on demonstrations that have left about 570 people dead and injured scores of others, Agence France-Presse reported. Myanmar youth meanwhile are calling for boycott of the annual Thingyan Water Festival holiday next week in defiance of the military regime and to honor those killed by security forces, the online news journal   reported. Last year’s holiday celebrations, which include splashing water on people in public places, were called off by the government due to the coronavirus pandemic. Military authorities, who already have closed the offices of deposed leader Aung San Su Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD), are continuing to pursue and arrest party officials and parliamentarians, according to residents in various areas. Security forces arrested Aye Khine, a member of parliament and a local NLD executive committee member, in Mandalay region on Tuesday, said one of his colleagues. “He was returning home from hiding for a while and was arrested while he was making a phone call in the city. His phone was also taken away,” said the NLD member who spoke to RFA on condition of anonymity. Ye Kyaw Thwin, an NLD lawmaker representing Mawlamyine township in Ayeyarwady region, was arrested by authorities Tuesday afternoon while fleeing a village following a complaint from a military informant, one of his colleagues said.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"myanmar-protest-kamayut-twp-yangon-apr6-2021g.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/economic-misery-04062021183304.html/myanmar-protest-kamayut-twp-yangon-apr6-2021g.jpg/@@images/3954fbc5-16a1-4c30-b18b-1697d0f217d7.jpeg\" title=\"myanmar-protest-kamayut-twp-yangon-apr6-2021g.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162235", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "15388", "source": "scrapy"},

The move comes even as India's drug regulator has extended Covishield's shelf life from six to nine months from its manufacturing date. In a recent communique to Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the WHO has also asked the firm to formulate the doses with enough titer and/or implement a higher specification at release so that the minimum specification of= 2.5 x108ifu/dose is fulfilled throughout the shelf life. Shelf life is the length of time for which an item remains fit for use. The DCGI in a letter to SII in February said it has no objection in respect of 'extension of shelf life of Covishield vaccine' in a multi-dose glass vial (10 dose-5ml) from six months to nine months. \"You are permitted to apply the shelf life of nine months to unlabelled vials available on hand, subject to the condition that the details of such stock, batch-wise, shall be submitted to this office and Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli,\" DCGI Dr V G Somani had said in the letter. The DCGI's decision will help health authorities in reducing vaccine wastage. According to an update by the UK drug regulator dated February 22, the shelf-life of the AstraZeneca   vaccine is six months. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the vaccine as the European Union's health agency concluded a \"possible link\" between the vaccine and rare blood clots but stressed that the benefits of the vaccine to protect against   continue to outweigh the risks. The UK's medicines regulator on Wednesday said that under-30s in the country will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to \"evolving evidence\" linking it to rare blood clots.

Less than half that number said yes.", "text": "BESSEMER, Ala. — Amazon warehouse workers here voted overwhelmingly against forming a union Friday after a monthslong campaign in which labor had hoped to make inroads into the sprawling company. As of Friday morning, 1,798 employees voted against unionizing, compared to 738 in favor. If it had been approved, the union would have been the first in the United States for Amazon, the country's second-largest employer. Even as the vote was being completed, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, the union seeking to represent the 5,800 workers in Bessemer, said it would challenge the vote by filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. It will allege that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity in the run-up to the election. “We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon's behavior in corrupting this election,\" said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU. “Working people deserve better than the way Amazon has conducted itself during this campaign. This campaign has proven that the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is to join together in a union. However, Amazon’s behavior during the election cannot be ignored and our union will seek remedy to each and every improper action Amazon took. We won’t rest until workers' voices are heard fairly under the law.\" Amazon disputed these charges in a blog   after the vote concluded. \"It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,\" the post read. \"Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.\" After the seven-week window to vote by mail ended March 29, the NLRB spent two weeks checking the eligibility of ballots and counting them in a process observed by the union and Amazon. Out of 5,876 eligible voters, 3,041 ballots were cast, but 505 were set aside as contested, mostly by Amazon, according to the union. Ballots can be contested by Amazon or the union based on factors like illegible signatures or questions about whether employees' job titles entitle them to vote. Those ballots are counted only if the final margin is small enough. Labor experts said the results are not a surprise, given the resources Amazon has invested in countering organizing. \"It's so hard for workers to win in a situation like this,\" said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \"The most likely outcome in these situations is that the employer successfully busts the union by instilling fear and uncertainty into the workers, and even those workers that were initially in favor of organizing into a union get afraid and change their mind.\" The Bessemer warehouse, which opened in March 2020, is Amazon's first fulfillment center in Alabama. Workers started organizing toward a union vote in August, hoping it would help improve their working conditions. Currently, it is difficult to go to the bathroom without being penalized, said Jennifer Bates, an Amazon worker in Bessemer, who said she was inspired to support the union effort after regularly having seen her colleagues walk out of work limping from the physical toll the job takes. At the start of this year, Amazon launched what labor experts characterized as a classic, well-funded anti-union campaign at the warehouse. Workers said they were required to attend multiple meetings during their shifts, in which Amazon representatives explained why a union was not, in their view, beneficial for workers. Posters all over the warehouse, some of them in bathroom stalls, encouraged workers to vote no. The company also distributed buttons and stickers for employees to wear, and it created a website and a hashtag, #DoItWithoutDues, highlighting how workers might have to pay $500 in annual dues to the union. Amazon has a  . In 1999, the Communication Workers of America started a campaign to unionize 400 customer service employees in Seattle. After months of anti-union campaigning, Amazon closed down the call center in 2000 in what the company said was a restructuring related to the dot-com bust. In 2014, 21 equipment technicians at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware   following what the union spokesman described as \"intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants.\" Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako   at the time that the \"no\" vote against third-party representation showed that employees \"prefer a direct connection with Amazon.\" Workers in Bessemer who opposed the union seemed to question its purpose. LaVonette Stokes, who works as a labor organizer for the Alabama teachers union when she's not working at Amazon, and her husband are have positions as mid-level process guides that earn $15 to $19 an hour. But she said that a union for unskilled labor in Bessemer makes no sense and that it would move too slowly. She and her husband spent $2,400 of their own money to print flyers that detailed Amazon's benefits. \"We're talking about a union that has made contracts where, yes, they got a raise, but it took them about five to seven years before they even got to that raise,\" she said. Her husband, William, said: \"We're not against unions. We're against this particular union, and we're against a union at this particular facility. Everything that this union is offering, we can do ourselves.\" Workers in favor of the union said they had hoped it would help improve their working conditions, providing better job security and benefits when Amazon is   in part because of a pandemic-induced boom in online retail. \"I like my job. I give it 110 percent every day I go in there, regardless how hard it is, how stressful it is,\" said Darryl Richardson, a worker at the Bessemer warehouse. \"But I feel like employees deserve better and more for what they do.\" Richardson said he and other pro-union workers expect to be fired or forced to quit their jobs. \"I have to move on, and I hate it,\" he said. \"It's sad that you do everything you can to try to make things better for the people and you feel like you are going to lose your job.\" Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, said in an email, \"We respect all our employees' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment.\" Amazon spokesperson Leah Seay said that in Bessemer receive health care coverage and hourly pay of at least $15.30, which is well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Alabama has no minimum wage law. Employees also get a retirement plan, Seay said. Despite the ultimate vote against unionizing, the drive attracted global attention to conditions for Amazon's warehouse workers and the  , said Givan, the Rutgers professor. \"Workers around the country who have been watching what's happening will be potentially inspired by what can happen if you do take action and get national attention,\" she said. It also drew attention from other unions. Following the results, Randy Korgan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Director for Amazon praised workers' attempts to unionize. “Despite going up against one of the world’s richest men in a country with weak labor laws, the workers in Bessemer brought national attention to issues that many non-union workers face in this industry,\" said Korgan. \"This fight is not over, and the Teamsters will always support workers who want to build power by standing together and demanding dignity, a safe workplace, and a fair return on their work.” Analysts said efforts to unionize at other Amazon warehouses in the U.S. are likely to continue, particularly in higher-cost states like New York and California. RWDSU spokesperson Chelsea Connor said the union received over a thousand inquiries about organizing from Amazon workers at other facilities since the organizing effort began. \"Amazon is already about the best-paying job a non-skilled laborer can get in Alabama,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"But in higher-costs states, it's barely a living wage. \"It will cut into profits,\" he said. \"But it's a humane thing to do.\"", "image_url": "<img src=\"https://media12.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/202104/1617986891265_ott_now_amazon_210409_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162235", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "62166", "source": "scrapy"},

The Bangladesh Bank had shortened the banking hours from 10:00 am to 12:30 pm on April 4, after the government announced a lockdown-like restriction, banning transport movement and closing shops for a week from April 5.  But the coronavirus situation has not improved. Instead, the number of infections and deaths is rising alarmingly. This prompted the government to come up with a strict countrywide lockdown from April 14.   Bankers of Sonali Bank, Southeast Bank, and South Bangla Agriculture and Commerce said many clients apprehended that banks might remain closed during the all-out lockdown. Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader and State Minister for Public Administration Farhad Hossain on Friday said that the government was considering a strict lockdown for a week from April 14. This has created the rush at the banks' premises to withdraw money as people feel comfortable keeping cash at hand at the time of crisis. Yesterday's BB notice did not say anything about the banking hours during the strict lockdown period. However, several central bankers have ruled out any closure of banks and suggested people not be worried. The central bank is working to keep available cash at automated teller machines. Customers will also avail of banking services through digital platforms from anywhere and anytime. The central bank has already increased the transaction ceiling under the booming mobile financial service (MFS) during the lockdown. A client can now send Tk 200,000 per month instead of the previous ceiling of Tk 75,000. Besides, people will not count any charge in sending a maximum of Tk 40,000 per month. Clients are allowed to send Tk 10,000 per transaction without any cost.

[Photo courtesy Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia]", "author_link": "", "published_date": "2021-04-07", "hashtag": "", "article_summary": "", "text": "The former army general and ex-Thai junta leader made the remarks days after Thailand’s friend China – as well as Russia – threw their support behind a special summit of Southeast Asian nations’ leaders to discuss the crisis in Myanmar. China’s reaction to the coup had been muted, just as when Prayuth, as the Royal Thai Army chief of staff, seized power in a military coup that toppled an elected government in 2014. “It is not that we don’t care about humanitarian problems – a life is a life – but the government proposes solutions to the problems via the foreign ministry,” Prayuth told reporters, in what appeared to be a defense of his government’s relatively muted response on the volatile situation in Myanmar since the military there overthrew a democratically elected government on Feb. 1. “We cannot do anything we want, because we have common borders [with Myanmar] and we rely on each other for many things. But we certainly do not agree with violence and we have said so to them, and have kept telling them to reduce [violence].” The Thai PM further said “we have to fix the troubles systemically” in Myanmar. He also noted that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was planning to soon hold a special meeting in Jakarta of leaders from across the regional bloc. Notably, the announcement by ASEAN members Malaysia and Brunei that a leaders’ summit would be held on Myanmar, came three days after China said it supported such a meeting. However, the bloc still has not yet announced a date for the special summit. The fastidiously non-interfering bloc has for more than two months not been able to reach a consensus on how to deal with the junta in member-state Myanmar. Last week, after the single deadliest day in post-coup Myanmar when the military and security forces killed 114 civilians during anti-junta protests on March 27, the Thai foreign ministry for the first time in two months expressed grave concern about the situation in the country next-door. By contrast, on the day of the Burmese coup, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan had said “It’s their own business, it’s their internal affair.” And on March 22, a Thai Army spokesman denied a local media report that a Thai border security agency had supplied 700 sacks of rice to the Myanmar Army base of operations in Karen state, which sits along the Thai-Myanmar frontier. The spokesman said any transaction that took place was part of “usual border trade.” The apparent change in the rhetoric from senior Thai officials coincided with an influx into Thailand of people fleeing from the violence in Myanmar. Thousands of ethnic Karen fled their homes in Karen state after the military’s March 27 air strikes on villages controlled by Karen National Union (KNU) rebels, who hold large swathes of territory in the borderlands with Thailand. On Wednesday, Prayuth said relevant agencies were helping the displaced people by bringing them critical food and medical supplies. “In the past also, in many cases of people affected by the fighting [in Myanmar] the military has saved people by letting many inside for medical treatment,” Prayuth said. According to Pornsuk Kerdsawang, from Thai NGO Friends Without Borders Foundation, the Myanmar military on Monday allowed a cargo ship from Thailand to deliver aid across the border. “On April 8, the Thai military will take five vehicles to help carry goods from the Red Cross and deliver them to those displaced people. As for us, we assessed this as a breakthrough in assistance,” Pornsuk told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service. Pornsuk said that helicopters and drones were heard on Tuesday flying around on the Myanmar side of the border in Karen state. She said she worried that the unrest along the frontier could threaten the rice season for local farmers. “[I]f the situation is still like this, they will be in trouble. Because they cannot grow rice, they will not have rice to eat, so we insist on our statement that we would like the government to provide assistance that takes into account long-term solutions,” Pornsuk said. “Because even if the Myanmar villagers [on the Myanmar side of the border] were given the aid that people sent, it’s not a success – just a solution to the immediate problems.” On April 2, Prayuth instructed all relevant relief agencies to give medical and other assistance to the 1,200 or so people who had crossed into Thailand, a Thai government spokesman, told reporters. Earlier last week, human rights and refugee advocacy groups had criticized the Thai PM for allegedly ordering the military to push the refugees back across the border into their strife-torn country. Meanwhile, Myanmar troops again fired at anti-coup protesters on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people and wounding several in the country’s northwest, news agencies reported. The death toll in the post-coup violence has reached at least 598, according to Thai NGO Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. In addition, Myanmar citizens are struggling with shortages of food and other necessities after 65 days of rule under the military junta, whose troops steal goods and cash from vehicles, stores, and homes, residents told the Myanmar Service of Radio Free Asia (RFA), with which BenarNews is affiliated. The continuing violence in Myanmar prompted Indonesia and the United Kingdom on Wednesday to reiterate calls for a halt to the brutality. “[I]ndonesia and the U.K. are appalled that hundreds of peaceful protesters have been killed in Myanmar,” said a statement issued by Britain, after a meeting of the two countries’ foreign ministers in Jakarta. “Both countries agreed on the importance of ASEAN as the pre-eminent regional institution and a key part of the Rules-Based International System to find acceptable solutions based on the will and the interests of the people in Myanmar.” Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said she and her British counterpart, Dominic Raab, had discussed how the U.K. and the international community could support ASEAN’s effort to help Myanmar resolve the turmoil there.", "image_url": "<img alt=\"Retno.jpg\" class=\"image-richtext image-inline\" src=\"https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/thai/retno.jpg/@@images/ad1d9754-a790-4f94-98d7-ddee3957576c.jpeg\" title=\"Retno.jpg\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162235", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html;charset=utf-8", "language": "en", "length": "13608", "source": "scrapy"},

Violence has surged in Afghanistan in recent months -- including a wave of assassinations against journalists, activists and civil servants, despite the launch of peace talks between the warring Afghan government and Taliban. On Friday, the UN Security Council \"condemned in the strongest terms the alarming number of attacks deliberately targeting civilians in Afghanistan\". It comes as speculation is rife about the United States' future in Afghanistan after a two-decade military involvement in the country. US President Joe Biden is wrapping up a review on whether to stick to an agreement with the Taliban negotiated by his predecessor Donald Trump who wanted to pull out the final US troops by May. The Biden administration has signalled that it wants to take a hard look at Trump's deal and its repercussions for Afghanistan and regional stability. Washington recently submitted a draft peace agreement to the authorities in Kabul and to the Taliban, including the creation of a \"new inclusive government,\" according to a letter from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that was revealed by Afghan media.  Russia has backed the initiative, as global powers ramp up efforts to secure a peace deal and end decades of war.", "image_url": "<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/story_page/public/2021/03/13/186963-a-car-bomb-attack-in-afghanistan.jpg?itok=ITwzcFcY\">", "crawl_date": "2021-04-11 162235", "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1", "content": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "language": "en", "length": "21504", "source": "scrapy"},
